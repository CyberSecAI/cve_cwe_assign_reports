## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2022-21170.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an improper check for certificate revocation in i-FILTER.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The software fails to properly validate if a certificate has been revoked, which is a CWE-299 issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can be carried out. This allows an attacker to eavesdrop on encrypted communication.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MitM attack. The attacker does not need to have any privileges (PR:N). The attack complexity is high (AC:H). No user interaction is required (UI:N).

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper check for certificate revocation**" as the root cause of the vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the vulnerability is due to an "improper check for certificate revocation" and identifies it as a CWE-299 issue. The description of CWE-299, "The product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised," directly matches the **weakness** described in the vulnerability. The impact is a man-in-the-middle attack and eavesdropping, which aligns with the security implications of a compromised certificate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-299 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found. However, the vulnerability can lead to other issues such as eavesdropping or data interception, which are impacts rather than direct weaknesses.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct mention of certificate revocation issue and CVE summary).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.

### Extended Description
An improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-295
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ParentOf -> CWE-370

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that certificates are checked for revoked status.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the revoked status.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2011-2014:** LDAP-over-SSL implementation does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL), allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.
- **CVE-2011-0199:** Operating system does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in some cases, allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.
- **CVE-2010-5185:** Antivirus product does not check whether certificates from signed executables have been revoked.
