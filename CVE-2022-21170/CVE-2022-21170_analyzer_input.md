## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2022-21170.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an improper check for certificate revocation in i-FILTER.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The software fails to properly validate if a certificate has been revoked, which is a CWE-299 issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can be carried out. This allows an attacker to eavesdrop on encrypted communication.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MitM attack. The attacker does not need to have any privileges (PR:N). The attack complexity is high (AC:H). No user interaction is required (UI:N).
