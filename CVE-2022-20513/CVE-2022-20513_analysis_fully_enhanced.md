# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-20513

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability is explicitly described as an out-of-bounds read. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | The **missing bounds check** implies a failure to validate the input quantity which leads to the **out of bounds read**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**out of bounds read** due to a **missing bounds check**". This directly maps to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) because the program is reading data beyond the intended buffer. The root cause is a **missing bounds check**, suggesting that the input wasn't validated, which is relevant to CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). Since the primary issue is the read operation going out of bounds, CWE-125 is the primary weakness. The reference link confirms the lack of input validation in the `Session::decrypt` function as the root cause.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a Base level CWE which describes the **out of bounds read** condition. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) can precede CWE-125 because the absence of a bounds check allows the out-of-bounds read to occur.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to explicit description of OOB read and missing bounds check)

## Known Examples for CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1440](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1440): lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2374](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2374): lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-31401**: An issue was discovered in tcp_rcv() in nptcp.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.
- **CVE-2021-31802**: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\n before the Content-Length header.
- **CVE-2021-37663**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-37665**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-3655**: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory.
- **CVE-2021-21404**: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.
- **CVE-2021-1903**: Possible denial of service scenario can occur due to lack of length check on Channel Switch Announcement IE in beacon or probe response frame in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking
