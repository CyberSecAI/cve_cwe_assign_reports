# Analysis to Review
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states a **deadlock** condition. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that "NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), where it can **deadlock**, which may lead to denial of service." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further reinforces this by stating, "The vulnerability is caused by a **deadlock** condition within the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin)." This directly corresponds to CWE-833 (Deadlock), which is defined as "The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock." The impact, denial of service, is a common consequence of a deadlock. The CWE-833 is a Base level of abstraction, and the Usage is Allowed.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-833 has no direct relationships defined in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "deadlock" in both the vulnerability description and CVE summary.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-667
ChildOf -> CWE-662

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1476:** A bug in some Intel Pentium processors allow DoS (hang) via an invalid "CMPXCHG8B" instruction, causing a deadlock
- **CVE-2009-2857:** OS deadlock
- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions
