# Analysis for CVE-2021-20733

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-939 | Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-451 | User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**Improper authorization** in handler for custom URL scheme vulnerability". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating "The `asken` App for Android does not properly restrict access to its custom URL scheme functionality," and explicitly mentions "**Improper Restriction of Custom URL Schemes (CWE-939)**". This aligns directly with CWE-939's description: "The product uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme." The impact, where an attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary website, supports this classification.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-939 has no direct relationships in the provided data. However, it's important to note that improper authorization can often lead to other weaknesses. The ability to redirect to arbitrary websites could potentially lead to phishing attacks (CWE-451), where the user interface is misrepresented.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the primary weakness is the improper authorization of the custom URL scheme, a secondary impact is the potential for **user interface misrepresentation**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary notes that the redirection capability can be used for phishing attacks. This aligns with CWE-451: "The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed." The attacker can redirect users to a fake website, mimicking a trusted service, and steal their credentials. This is a classic example of UI misrepresentation. This is a secondary effect of the main weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-451 is a Class-level CWE, and while it doesn't have direct relationships in the provided data, it's related to vulnerabilities that involve deceiving the user through UI manipulation. Given that the redirection can lead to phishing, CWE-451 is a reasonable secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate evidence. The phishing attack is a potential consequence of the primary weakness but isn't explicitly stated as a definite outcome.)
