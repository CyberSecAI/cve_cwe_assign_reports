      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the key derivation process for the local cache encryption. The key is derived using the application type, the credential provider username, and two hard-coded byte sequences. Due to a lack of sufficient entropy in the username and the limited number of application types, the effective key space is drastically reduced, making brute-force attacks feasible.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt the local cache files, which may contain sensitive information such as passwords, password metadata, and other application properties.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "An attacker with root access to the system hosting the CyberArk Credential Provider can access the cache files.",
          "Other potential attack vectors include abuse of setuid/setgid executables, accessing the target file system while booted in or mounted from an alternate OS, and unprotected backups."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs root-level access to the system where the CyberArk Credential Provider is installed, or have access to unprotected backups. Knowledge of the key derivation scheme and encryption mechanics is also necessary. If the attacker has access to the appprovideruser.cred file, application logs, or knows the site naming conventions, they can further reduce the key space."

       "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The effective key space used to encrypt the cache is significantly reduced due to the limited entropy in the values used for key derivation. Specifically, the application type has only 3 possible values, and the application user (username) can be narrowed down by the attacker.  The key derivation process uses  SHA1 hashes with the application type, username, and two hardcoded byte sequences which, combined with the limited entropy, results in a weak key.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can decrypt the local cache files, gaining access to stored passwords, metadata, and application properties. This would enable the attacker to gain access to various resources.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "An attacker with root privileges on the system hosting the CyberArk Credential Provider can access the encrypted cache files.",
           "Other attack vectors include abusing setuid/setgid executables, booting from an alternate OS, or accessing unprotected backups."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires root level access to the system. Knowledge of the hardcoded byte sequences and the key derivation process is also necessary. Knowledge of the application type and username further reduces the keyspace to a trivial level."
