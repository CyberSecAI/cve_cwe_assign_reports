| CWE-788 | Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions "**memory corruption**" which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" indicates the "**Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788)". While CWE-788 is a potential candidate, the summary also mentions "Out-of-bounds read" as a weakness. Given that the primary impact is arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption, **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** is a more fitting primary weakness because writing outside the intended buffer often leads to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. CWE-788 is a read/write past the buffer boundary, while the summary only mentions out-of-bounds read. Since the write portion is the more impactful, CWE-787 is a better fit than CWE-788 as the primary weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-119. CWE-788 is related to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
