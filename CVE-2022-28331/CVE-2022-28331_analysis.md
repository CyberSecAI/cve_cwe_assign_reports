# Analysis for CVE-2022-28331

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability is a direct result of an integer overflow. |
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The integer overflow leads to a stack-based buffer overflow. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that the Apache Portable Runtime 1.7.0 and earlier may write beyond the end of a stack-based buffer due to an **integer overflow**. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is the primary **rootcause** of this vulnerability. The **integer overflow** leads to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) because the overflowed value is likely used to determine the size or index of a write operation to the stack buffer, causing it to write beyond its boundaries. Both CWEs are at preferred abstraction levels. The description clearly indicates an **integer overflow** as the **rootcause** and a **stack based buffer overflow** as the **weakness**, therefore these two CWEs are most appropriate. The retriever results supports assigning CWE-190, CWE-124, and CWE-121. CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite) is not appropriate, but both CWE-190 and CWE-121 are very appropriate. The MITRE mapping guidance for both CWE-190 and CWE-121 indicates that their usage is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a base level CWE. CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) can precede CWE-190.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and vulnerability description key phrases)
