### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unsafely present session identifier**
- **impact:** sensitive information disclosure
- **product:** TYPO3 routes (aka Extbase Yaml Routes) extension
- **version:** before 2.1.1
- **component:** CsrfTokenViewHelper

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-36793:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The TYPO3 extension "Extbase Yaml Routes" (routes) uses the `CsrfTokenViewHelper` which discloses the user's session identifier directly to HTML output without proper cryptographic hashing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: The user's session identifier is exposed in the HTML output.
- Inadequate Output Encoding: Lack of cryptographic hashing on the session identifier before output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability itself cannot be exploited directly, but it can be chained with another attack, like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to gain access to sensitive user information.
- By extracting the user's session identifier an attacker could potentially impersonate the user.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Requires a chained attack like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the frontend output. The session identifier is exposed but an attacker would need a separate vector to inject malicious code that extracts this identifier

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to perform Cross-Site Scripting attack on the frontend of the application.
-  Low privileged access is sufficient for the initial XSS injection point.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected versions are 2.1.0 and below.
- The vulnerability severity is rated as medium.
- The fixed version is 2.1.1.
- The vulnerability is located in a third-party extension not part of the default TYPO3 installation.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that a **session identifier** is **unsafely present in HTML output**. This is a clear case of **sensitive information disclosure**, specifically the transmission of sensitive information (the session ID) to an actor (a user viewing the HTML source) who should not have access to it. This aligns directly with CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data], where the code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes **sensitive information** that should not be accessible to that actor. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further validates this by stating that the vulnerability results in **Sensitive Information Disclosure** because the `CsrfTokenViewHelper` exposes the user's session identifier without proper cryptographic hashing. CWE-201 is a base level CWE, which is appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], but CWE-201 is more specific because it identifies that the sensitive information is being sent in data. The Retriever Results lists CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data] with a score of 0.2740. CWE-319 [Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information] could be a secondary mapping, as the session identifier is exposed in cleartext (unhashed). While the primary concern is the disclosure, the lack of encryption on the session ID is a contributing factor. However, since the primary issue is the inclusion in the output and not necessarily the transmission itself, it is a secondary consideration.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.

## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.
