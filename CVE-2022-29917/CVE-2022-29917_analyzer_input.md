# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-29917

## Vulnerability Description
Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, Tom Ritter and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported **memory safety bugs** present in Firefox 99 and Firefox ESR 91.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory safety bugs**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **product:** Thunderbird and Firefox ESR and Firefox
- **version:** < 91.9, < 91.9, < 100

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29917:

**Root Cause:**
- Memory safety bugs were present in Firefox 99, Firefox ESR 91.8 and Thunderbird 91.8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary weakness is the presence of memory safety bugs, leading to potential memory corruption. The specific nature of these bugs is not detailed but is listed in the referenced bug list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory states that some of these memory safety bugs showed evidence of memory corruption. With enough effort, these could potentially be exploited to run arbitrary code. This means a successful exploit could lead to full system compromise.
