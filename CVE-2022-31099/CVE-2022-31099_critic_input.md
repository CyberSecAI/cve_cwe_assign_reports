# Critic Input for CVE-2022-31099



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a **stack overflow**. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **stack overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **vector:** parsing untrusted rulex expressions
- **product:** rulex

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-31099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled recursion in the rulex parsing logic. Specifically, deeply nested expressions can cause a stack overflow, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled recursion during parsing of rulex expressions.
- Lack of a recursion limit or a mechanism to prevent excessively deep nesting during parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to stack overflow, causing the process to abort immediately.
- The service becomes unavailable if the process parsing rulex expressions crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a crafted rulex expression with several hundred levels of nesting as input to the parsing logic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide untrusted rulex expressions as input to the service.
-  Ability to cause the process running rulex to abort due to stack overflow.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The issue was addressed by adding a recursion limit in version 0.4.3.
- The fix involved adding a `recursion` field to the Input struct, incrementing/decrementing it at the start and end of parsing functions.
- The `recursion_start` method will return an error `ParseErrorKind::RecursionLimit` if the limit is reached.
- The commit `60aa2dc` adds this recursion limit.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
- The affected versions are <= 0.4.2.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion).

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that a **stack overflow** occurs when parsing untrusted rulex expressions with several hundred levels of nesting, leading to a denial-of-service. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is due to **uncontrolled recursion** in the rulex parsing logic. The provided information specifically highlights the lack of a recursion limit. This aligns directly with CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), which describes a situation where a product does not properly control the amount of recursion, consuming excessive resources. The fix involved adding a recursion limit, further supporting this classification.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE. While it might have more specific Base-level children, the provided information does not give enough details to determine a more specific CWE. The Retriever Results also list CWE-674 with a high score, further indicating its relevance. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-674 is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW, which is appropriate given its Class level.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of stack overflow caused by uncontrolled recursion, clear root cause and fix description.)
