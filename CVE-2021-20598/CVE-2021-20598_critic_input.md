## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism**," which perfectly aligns with CWE-645 (Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism). The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to lockout legitimate users by continuously attempting logins with incorrect passwords, leading to a denial-of-service. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, identifying the root cause as an "**Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism (CWE-645)**".
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-645 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. There are no direct relationships identified for CWE-645.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct statement of root cause and supporting CVE reference summary)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-645: Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains an account lockout protection mechanism, but the mechanism is too restrictive and can be triggered too easily, which allows attackers to deny service to legitimate users by causing their accounts to be locked out.

### Extended Description
Account lockout is a security feature often present in applications as a countermeasure to the brute force attack on the password based authentication mechanism of the system. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the users' account may be disabled for a certain period of time or until it is unlocked by an administrator. Other security events may also possibly trigger account lockout. However, an attacker may use this very security feature to deny service to legitimate system users. It is therefore important to ensure that the account lockout security mechanism is not overly restrictive.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Implement more intelligent password throttling mechanisms such as those which take IP address into account, in addition to the login name.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Implement a lockout timeout that grows as the number of incorrect login attempts goes up, eventually resulting in a complete lockout.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider alternatives to account lockout that would still be effective against password brute force attacks, such as presenting the user machine with a puzzle to solve (makes it do some computation).
