# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-27171

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an **off-by-one error** (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **off-by-one error**
- **impact:** side-channel attacks
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** before 5.11.8
- **component:** kernel/bpf/verifier.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) verifier, specifically within the `retrieve_ptr_limit()` function. This function calculates the valid memory area (`ptr_limit`) for registers holding stack or map values, used for bounds checking in speculative execution scenarios. The root cause is an off-by-one error when calculating the memory area size when the pointer moves to the left (subtraction).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Integer Underflow:** When the calculated `ptr_limit` becomes zero (e.g., subtracting zero from a pointer at the beginning of a map element), an integer underflow occurs in `fixup_bpf_calls()`. This leads to the generation of an incorrect mask (0xffffffff), instead of a properly sign-extended value.
2.  **Incorrect Mask:** The incorrect mask allows a BPF program to perform speculative out-of-bounds loads on a 4GB window within the kernel's memory space.
3. **Speculative Execution Vulnerability:** The flaw allows attackers to speculatively bypass bounds checks, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this flaw to speculatively read kernel memory contents via side-channel attacks.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** By extracting sensitive kernel information, there is a potential risk of further attacks, although the information does not specify a clear path to privilege escalation.
*   **Denial of Service:** The description in the bug report mentions that a local attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must be able to run BPF programs on the target system. This can be done by having a user with sufficient privileges, CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to load eBPF programs:** The attacker needs the ability to load and execute BPF programs.
*   **Local access to the system:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system or a guest system where they can run the BPF program.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the `kernel/bpf/verifier.c` file.
*   The `retrieve_ptr_limit()` function is where the faulty offset calculation occurs.
*   The incorrect mask is generated in `fixup_bpf_calls()` due to the integer underflow.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a pointer moves to the left (subtraction) inside a BPF program.
*   The minimal fix involves correcting the offset calculation in `retrieve_ptr_limit()`.
*   The full series of patches includes further protections against speculative out-of-bounds reads in BPF programs.

**Mitigation**
*   The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from using eBPF via the `kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled` sysctl. This reduces the attack surface, requiring a privileged user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root) to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited with a relatively simple eBPF program.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) was developed to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Linux kernel version 5.11.8 and later.
*   The vulnerability is related to speculative execution and is a Spectre-like issue.
