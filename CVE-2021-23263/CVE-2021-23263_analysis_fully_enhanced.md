## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that unauthenticated remote attackers can read textual content, including files in specific directories and some files in the .git directory. The CVE reference links content summary explicitly states that CVE-2021-23263 is categorized as **CWE-402** Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak'). This **weakness** arises because private resources are made accessible to untrusted parties. The description directly supports this classification, aligning with the core definition of CWE-402. The retriever results also list CWE-402, albeit with a lower score compared to other candidates. However, given the explicit mention in the CVE details, it is the most appropriate primary CWE. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-402 is Allowed-with-Review because it is a Class CWE and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-402 is a Class-level CWE, its direct presence in the CVE details makes it the primary choice. Related CWEs include CWE-538 (Information Exposure Through File System), CWE-212 (Information Exposure Through an Easily Retrievable Resource), and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), which are all child weaknesses and base level.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct mention in CVE details)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* Since the vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to files, including those in the `.git` directory and other sensitive areas, **CWE-425** Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') is a relevant secondary classification. The vulnerability allows attackers to directly request and access restricted files without proper authorization checks. This aligns with the description of CWE-425, where the application does not adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs or files. The retriever results also list this as the top candidate based on combined score. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-425 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* The relationship to CWE-402 is that the **resource leak** (CWE-402) leads to the possibility of **forced browsing** (CWE-425) because resources that should be private are made accessible.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence based on the ability to directly access restricted files)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* **CWE-552** Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties, is relevant because the vulnerability results in files being accessible to unauthorized actors. The description specifies that unauthenticated remote attackers can read textual content, which directly implies unauthorized access to files. While similar to CWE-425, CWE-552 emphasizes the accessibility of the files themselves, rather than the method of access. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-552 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-552 and CWE-425 are closely related, representing different facets of the same vulnerability. CWE-425 describes the method of access (direct request), while CWE-552 describes the result (files accessible to external parties).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Moderate confidence based on the unauthorized accessibility of files)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* Given that attackers can read files from `/scripts/*`, `/templates/*`, and potentially traverse into `.git/*` directories, **CWE-22** Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') is a potential secondary weakness. Although not explicitly stated, the ability to access files in the `.git/*` directory suggests a possible path traversal vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-22 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-22 is related to CWE-402 and CWE-552 in that the improper limitation of pathnames (CWE-22) can lead to the exposure of private resources (CWE-402) and the unauthorized access to files (CWE-552).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.4 (Low confidence, as path traversal is implied but not explicitly confirmed)



## Known Examples for CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-3733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-3733): Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2005-0406** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0406](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0406): Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).
- **CVE-2002-0704** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0704](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0704): NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-3031**: Padding bytes in Ethernet packets on PA-200, PA-220, PA-500, PA-800, PA-2000 Series, PA-3000 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series firewalls are not cleared before the data frame is created. This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.
- **CVE-2021-3681**: A flaw was found in Ansible Galaxy Collections. When collections are built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not explicitly excluded via the ``build_ignore`` list in "galaxy.yml" include files in the ``.tar.gz`` file. This contains sensitive info, such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` verbose output without the``no_log`` redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.
- **CVE-2021-3602**: An information disclosure flaw was found in Buildah, when building containers using chroot isolation. Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials).
- **CVE-2022-24719**: Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.
- **CVE-2022-24798**: Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
- **CVE-2022-2818**: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository cockpit-hq/cockpit prior to 2.2.2. 
- **CVE-2022-25187**: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.79 and earlier does not redact some sensitive information in the support bundle.
