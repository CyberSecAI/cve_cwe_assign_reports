# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1068

## Vulnerability Description
Modbus Tools Modbus Slave (versions 7.4.2 and prior) is vulnerable to a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the registration field. This may cause the program to crash when a long character string is used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** program crash
- **vector:** long character string
- **product:** Modbus Tools
- **version:** 7.4.2 and prior
- **component:** registration field

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the registration field of the Modbus Slave software. This occurs when the software doesn't properly validate the length of the input provided for the registration key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The software allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, which can lead to overwriting other parts of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The primary impact is that the application crashes when a long string is provided in the registration field. This can disrupt the functionality of the PLC programming simulation tool.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system where Modbus Slave is running.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to input a long string into the registration field, which involves some form of user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have the ability to interact with the system where Modbus Slave is installed.
*   **Knowledge of Input Field:** The attacker must be able to input data into the software's registration key field.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerability by providing a long string.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided content is from a CISA advisory.
* The advisory provides a CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 with vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating Local attack vector, low complexity, no privileges required, user interaction required, no impact on confidentiality or integrity, but high impact on availability.
* The vulnerability is found in Modbus Slave versions 7.4.2 and prior.
* The vendor has released a fix in version 7.4.3 and recommends upgrading.
