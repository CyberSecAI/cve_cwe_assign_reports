# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-46238

## Vulnerability Description
GPAC v1.1.0 was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the function gf_node_get_name () at scenegraph/base_scenegraph.c. This vulnerability can lead to a program crash, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **impact:** program crash, Denial of Service (DoS)
- **product:** GPAC
- **version:** v1.1.0
- **component:** gf_node_get_name() function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a NULL pointer dereference in the `gf_node_get_name` function, located in `scenegraph/base_scenegraph.c` at line 1293. This occurs when the function receives an invalid `GF_Node` pointer (`p`). The code attempts to access `p->sgprivate->flags` without properly validating that `p` and `p->sgprivate` are valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the dereference of the potentially null pointer `p`. When `p` is an invalid pointer, it leads to a segmentation fault because the program tries to read from an invalid memory location (`p->sgprivate->flags`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Segmentation Fault:** The immediate impact is a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated crashes can lead to a denial of service, making the application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector is through a crafted input file (POC2.zip) that, when processed by `MP4Box`, leads to the invalid pointer in `gf_node_get_name`.
- **Specific Command-Line Arguments:** The vulnerability is triggered when using specific command-line arguments with `MP4Box` (`-disox -ttxt -2 -dump-chap-ogg -dump-cover -drtp -bt -out /dev/null POC2`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted input file (`POC2`) to `MP4Box`.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `MP4Box` utility with specific command-line arguments.
- No special system privileges are mentioned as required for the exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided backtrace shows that the `gf_node_get_name` function is called from `gf_dump_vrml_route` which suggests the vulnerability is in how VRML route data is handled during the dumping process.
- The fix was implemented and the issue was closed.
