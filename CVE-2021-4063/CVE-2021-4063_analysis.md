# Analysis for CVE-2021-4063

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states "Use after free" and the retriever results also strongly suggest this CWE. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**use after free**" condition in developer tools of Google Chrome. This directly corresponds to CWE-416, "Use After Free," which occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed. The description includes "**heap corruption**" due to the use after free. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as "Use after free" and indicates it can lead to execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, or information disclosure. The Retriever Results rank CWE-416 as the top candidate with a high score. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates it is ALLOWED for this type of vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other CWEs such as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-843 (Type Confusion) are present in the Retriever Results, they are secondary to the primary "**use after free**" condition described. CWE-416 is a variant-level CWE, offering sufficient specificity.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "use after free" in the vulnerability description and supporting evidence from CVE reference and retriever results.)
