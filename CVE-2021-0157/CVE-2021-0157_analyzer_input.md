## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-0157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient control flow management in the BIOS firmware for some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary vulnerability is related to how the BIOS firmware manages the control flow during its operation. The lack of sufficient control flow management allows for potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to an **escalation of privilege**. This means an attacker could gain higher-level access than they should normally have, potentially allowing them to control the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **local access**. This means the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system where the vulnerable BIOS firmware is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a **privileged user** on the local system. The CVSS vector string specifies "PR:H" which means that the attacker needs high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The document also mentions a related CVE, CVE-2021-0158, which has a similar impact but is due to improper input validation in the BIOS firmware.
*   The document lists the affected Intel processor families.
*   The document states that a firmware update is needed to mitigate this vulnerability.

**Summary of CVSS Vector:**

*   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is relatively easy to perform.
*   **PR:H (Privileges Required: High):** The attacker must have high privileges on the system.
*   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **S:C (Scope: Changed):**  The vulnerability can affect resources beyond the component which has the vulnerability. In this case, escalation of privileges has the potential to impact more than just the BIOS.
*   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** Successful exploitation could lead to high impact on confidentiality.
*   **I:H (Integrity: High):** Successful exploitation could lead to high impact on integrity.
*    **A:H (Availability: High):** Successful exploitation could lead to high impact on availability.
