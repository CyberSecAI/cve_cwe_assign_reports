## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-2163:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of this vulnerability is a **use-after-free error** in the Cast UI and Toolbar component of the Chromium browser.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Use-after-free (UAF):**  This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. The freed memory might have been allocated for a different purpose by that point, or it might be unmapped, which can lead to crashes or undefined behavior, including potential for exploitation.

**Impact:**
- **Remote Code Execution (Possible):**  The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. By exploiting the UAF, an attacker might be able to manipulate memory and inject malicious code, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vector:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Cast UI and Toolbar, indicating the vulnerability might be triggered through interactions with the browser's Cast feature. It is triggered remotely.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- An attacker would likely need to craft malicious content that would cause the browser to free a memory location related to the Cast UI and toolbar and then attempt to access this memory again. This could potentially be achieved by directing a user to a malicious website or perhaps through manipulation of media casting functionality.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as a **low** severity issue by the Chrome team (though Gentoo marks it as a high severity)
- This vulnerability was reported by Chaoyuan Peng (@ret2happy).
- Patches have been released by Google to fix the vulnerability in Chrome and other derived products.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-2163 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Cast UI and Toolbar of the Chromium browser.  It can be exploited remotely to achieve code execution.
