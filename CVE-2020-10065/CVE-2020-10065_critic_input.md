# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Missing Size Checks in Bluetooth HCI over SPI. Zephyr versions >= v1.14.2, >= v2.2.0 contain **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130). For more information, see https//github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-hg2w-62p6-g67c

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency**
- **product:** Zephyr
- **version:** versions >= v1.14.2, >= v2.2.0
- **component:** Bluetooth HCI over SPI

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `bt_spi_rx_thread` function within the Bluetooth HCI over SPI driver (`drivers/bluetooth/hci/spi.c`).
- The code directly copies a size value from the ACL header of an incoming SPI message without proper validation. This size value is then used to copy data into a fixed-size buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write if the attacker provides a large size value in the ACL header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lack of input validation:** The code fails to validate the length field (`acl_hdr.len`) read from the received data. It is treated as trusted data without any checks.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The size read from the header is used to write data to a fixed-size buffer (defaulting to 77 bytes). If the length is greater than the buffer's capacity, a write outside of the buffer occurs, causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A large specified size could cause a crash, resulting in denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The out-of-bounds write can be potentially exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. By carefully crafting the data to be copied, an attacker may overwrite critical parts of memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Access via SPI:** The attack vector is physical access to the SPI interface connected to the vulnerable device. The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted Bluetooth HCI message over SPI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical access to the SPI bus.** The attacker must have the ability to send SPI messages to the vulnerable device.
- **Ability to control the data sent:** The attacker must be able to craft a HCI_ACL message and manipulate the `len` field in the `acl_hdr`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Zephyr versions v1.14.2, and v2.2.0-v2.7.0 and is fixed in version v3.0.0.
- The vulnerability has a low CVSS severity score of 3.8, primarily due to the physical attack vector.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130)" as the root cause. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further clarifies that the `bt_spi_rx_thread` function copies a size value from the ACL header of an incoming SPI message without proper validation, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This aligns perfectly with the CWE-130 description: "The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data." The MITRE mapping guidance marks CWE-130 usage as ALLOWED, further solidifying this choice.
  - The out-of-bounds write condition leads to **out-of-bounds read** and **out-of-bounds write** conditions. Because the code copies data into a fixed-size buffer based on the unvalidated length from the header, an attacker can cause memory corruption. The vulnerability description states the size is used to write data to a fixed-size buffer, and if the length is greater than the buffer's capacity, a write outside of the buffer occurs, causing a buffer overflow. This write outside the intended buffer is a clear instance of CWE-787.
  - The vulnerability description also indicates **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** because the code does not validate the `acl_hdr.len` field. This lack of validation allows an attacker to specify a size larger than the buffer, contributing to the out-of-bounds write.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-130 directly relates to data handling and input validation, which are critical for secure software development. Since the length is not validated, it can precede out-of-bounds read and write, and other memory corruption issues.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct mention in the vulnerability description and supporting technical details)

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

### Extended Description
If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

### Alternative Terms
length manipulation
length tampering

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When processing structured incoming data containing a size field followed by raw data, ensure that you identify and resolve any inconsistencies between the size field and the actual size of the data.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Do not let the user control the size of the buffer.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Validate that the length of the user-supplied data is consistent with the buffer size.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This probably overlaps other categories including zero-length issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.
- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.



## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.
