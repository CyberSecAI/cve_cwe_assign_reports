# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-29568

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **null pointer dereference** in TensorFlow's `tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` operation. The code **does not validate input arguments before accessing the first element of `shape`**. If the `shape` argument is empty, accessing the first element leads to a **crash**. This aligns precisely with CWE-476, which describes dereferencing a pointer that is expected to be valid but is NULL. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also explicitly states **"Null Pointer Dereference: When an empty shape tensor is provided as input, `shape_tensor.flat<int32>()` results in an empty array, leading to access of index 0 on empty data which causes a crash, which is undefined behavior."** The Retriever Results also lists CWE-476 as a possible CWE with a high score. CWE-476 is at the Base level of abstraction and the mapping guidance indicates that it is ALLOWED. CWE-20 could be considered since the input is not validated. However, CWE-476 is more specific and directly related to the vulnerability, so it is the primary CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-476 is a child of CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions). CWE-476 can precede CWE-789 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation) because a null pointer dereference could lead to memory allocation issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

## Known Examples for CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3701](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3701): program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1708): memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field
- **CVE-2008-0977** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0977](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0977): large value in a length field leads to memory consumption and crash when no more memory is available
- **CVE-2006-3791** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3791](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3791): large key size in game program triggers crash when a resizing function cannot allocate enough memory
- **CVE-2004-2589** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2589](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2589): large Content-Length HTTP header value triggers application crash in instant messaging application due to failure in memory allocation
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18899**: An uncontrolled memory allocation in DataBufdata(subBox.length-sizeof(box)) function of Exiv2 0.27 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a crafted input.
- **CVE-2021-3527**: A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.
- **CVE-2021-36174**: A memory allocation with excessive size value vulnerability in the license verification function of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow an attacker to perform a denial of service attack via specially crafted license blobs.
- **CVE-2020-5802**: An attacker-controlled memory allocation size can be passed to the C++ new operator in RnaDaSvr.dll by sending a specially crafted ConfigureItems message to TCP port 4241. This will cause an unhandled exception, resulting in termination of RSLinxNG.exe. Observed in FactoryTalk 6.11. All versions of FactoryTalk Linx are affected.
