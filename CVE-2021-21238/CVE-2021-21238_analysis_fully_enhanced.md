## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**improper verification of cryptographic signature**" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by detailing the lack of XML schema validation, leading to the acceptance of invalidly signed SAML documents. This aligns directly with CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature), which describes a product's failure to properly verify the cryptographic signature of data. The security implication is that an attacker can bypass authentication or impersonate a user, as noted in the CVE summary. The Retriever Results also identifies CWE-347 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0246. The MITRE mapping guidance designates the usage of CWE-347 as ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-347 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. There are no direct relationships listed in the provided information.

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that the **weakness** is due to "**XML Signature wrapping** because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the lack of XML Schema validation is the key enabler of the XML Signature Wrapping attack. This aligns with CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation), where the product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema. By not validating against the schema, the application is vulnerable to processing a wrapped signature, which means the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** is possible. The Retriever Results identifies CWE-112 as a possible candidate with a score of 0.7562. The MITRE mapping guidance designates the usage of CWE-112 as ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-112 is a base CWE, and the retriever results provides several other CWEs that are children of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), and CWE-112 is one of the parents.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results for CWE-347).
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results for CWE-112).

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21405**: Lotus is an Implementation of the Filecoin protocol written in Go. BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: "serialized", and "compressed", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.
- **CVE-2020-23533**: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.
- **CVE-2021-0152**: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.
- **CVE-2021-21238**: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
- **CVE-2021-21239**: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
- **CVE-2021-22708**: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.
