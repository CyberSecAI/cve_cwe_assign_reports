## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Stack buffer overflow allows writing beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code by overwriting data on the stack, potentially gaining full control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The advisory does not specify the exact attack vector, but implies that it involves sending crafted input to the affected applications (QVR Elite, QVR Pro, and QVR Guard).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable applications, likely through network access.
