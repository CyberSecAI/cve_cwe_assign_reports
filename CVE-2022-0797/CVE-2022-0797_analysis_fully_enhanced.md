# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "Out of bounds **memory write** in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 99.0.4844.51 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds **memory write** via a crafted HTML page." This directly corresponds to CWE-787, which is defined as "The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights "Out of bounds memory access" as the root cause and "Out of bounds memory access" as a weakness. Given the explicit mention of a **memory write** and the root cause, CWE-787 is the most appropriate primary classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 is ALLOWED, solidifying this choice.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE. It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 is also related to other buffer overflow/underflow conditions.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and confirmation from CVE reference).

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the primary issue is a write, the vulnerability description mentions "Out of bounds memory access" which could also imply a read. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is defined as "The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer." It is included as a secondary candidate CWE because the initial memory access could have been a read that resulted in the condition that lead to the out-of-bounds write. However, the clear statement of an out-of-bounds **memory write** leads to it being classified as a secondary weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a base level CWE and child of CWE-119. It is related to other memory access issues.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Lower confidence because the vulnerability description focuses on the write.)
