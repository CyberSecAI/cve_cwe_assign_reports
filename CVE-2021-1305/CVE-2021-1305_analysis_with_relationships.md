# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.75 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.65 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that an authenticated, remote attacker could bypass authorization and modify the configuration, gain access to sensitive information, and view information that they are not authorized to access. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is insufficient authorization checks of user account privileges. This aligns well with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which describes the product not performing an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. While CWE-285 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged, the available information does not point to a more specific Base-level CWE, so CWE-285 is used. Additionally, the impact, which involves unauthorized access to sensitive information such as logs, configurations, and device information is also addressed by CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere), which is listed as a secondary issue."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-285 is a class-level CWE. CWE-497 is a Base level CWE. It is related to information exposure and could result from the authorization bypass. CWE-285 is a parent of many authorization-related CWEs. The lack of specific details prevents selection of a more granular CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference.)
