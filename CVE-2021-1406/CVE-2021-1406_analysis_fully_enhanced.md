## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves the **improper inclusion of sensitive information in downloadable files**. This aligns directly with CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory), which describes a product placing sensitive information into files or directories accessible to actors who should not have access to that information. The description states that an attacker can obtain hashed credentials of system users, confirming the sensitive nature of the information. The vulnerability is triggered by authenticating and issuing specific commands, which suggests the files are made accessible through a specific function that's exposed post-authentication. CWE-538 is a Base level CWE, making it an appropriate level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-538 indicates it is ALLOWED.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-538 is related to CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) and CWE-200 (Information Exposure). However, since the information is in downloadable files, CWE-538 is more specific than CWE-200, and logging is not explicitly mentioned, making CWE-538 the better fit over CWE-532.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and root cause)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is a candidate because it also describes the **exposure of sensitive information**. However, it's broader than CWE-538, which specifies that the information is included in files or directories. Since we know the sensitive information is exposed via downloadable files, CWE-538 is a more precise classification as the primary weakness. CWE-497 can be considered a secondary issue.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-497 is related to information exposure issues, but it is not as specific as CWE-538 in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.60 (Medium confidence, secondary to CWE-538)



## Known Examples for CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-1999036** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1999036](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1999036): SSH password for private key stored in build log
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1406**: A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper inclusion of sensitive information in downloadable files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a specific set of commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain hashed credentials of system users. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to have valid user credentials with elevated privileges.
- **CVE-2021-39898**: In all versions of GitLab CE/EE since version 10.6, a project export leaks the external webhook token value which may allow access to the project which it was exported from.
- **CVE-2021-36151**: In Apache Gobblin, the Hadoop token is written to a temp file that is visible to all local users on Unix-like systems. This affects versions <= 0.15.0. Users should update to version 0.16.0 which addresses this issue.
- **CVE-2021-40363**: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 (All versions), SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 (All versions), SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1 (All versions < V9.1 SP1), SIMATIC WinCC V15 and earlier (All versions < V15 SP1 Update 7), SIMATIC WinCC V16 (All versions < V16 Update 5), SIMATIC WinCC V17 (All versions < V17 Update 2), SIMATIC WinCC V17 (All versions <= V17 Update 4), SIMATIC WinCC V7.4 (All versions < V7.4 SP1 Update 19), SIMATIC WinCC V7.5 (All versions < V7.5 SP2 Update 6). The affected component stores the credentials of a local system account in a potentially publicly accessible project file using an outdated cipher algorithm. An attacker may use this to brute force the credentials and take over the system.
- **CVE-2022-27195**: Jenkins Parameterized Trigger Plugin 2.43 and earlier captures environment variables passed to builds triggered using Jenkins Parameterized Trigger Plugin, including password parameter values, in their `build.xml` files. These values are stored unencrypted and can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.
- **CVE-2022-0013**: A file information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent that enables a local attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the system with elevated privileges when generating a support file. This issue impacts: Cortex XDR agent 5.0 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 5.0.12; Cortex XDR agent 6.1 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 6.1.9; Cortex XDR agent 7.2 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 7.2.4; Cortex XDR agent 7.3 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 7.3.2.
- **CVE-2022-24782**: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions 2.8.2 and prior in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `tests-passed` branch are vulnerable to a data leak. Users can request an export of their own activity. Sometimes, due to category settings, they may have category membership for a secure category. The name of this secure category is shown to the user in the export. The same thing occurs when the user's post has been moved to a secure category. A patch for this issue is available in the `main` branch of Discourse's GitHub repository and is anticipated to be part of future releases.


## Known Examples for CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-32638** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32638](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32638): Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0291**: An Exposure of System Data vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, where a sensitive system-level resource is not being sufficiently protected, allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to send specific traffic which partially reaches this resource. A high rate of specific traffic may lead to a partial Denial of Service (DoS) as the CPU utilization of the RE is significantly increased. The SNMP Agent Extensibility (agentx) process should only be listening to TCP port 705 on the internal routing instance. External connections destined to port 705 should not be allowed. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.3R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 13.2R1.
