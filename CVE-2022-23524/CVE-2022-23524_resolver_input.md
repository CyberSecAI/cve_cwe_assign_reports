# Resolution Input for CVE-2022-23524

## Vulnerability Description
Helm is a tool for managing Charts, pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Versions prior to 3.10.3 are subject to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, resulting in Denial of Service. Input to functions in the _strvals_ package can cause a stack overflow. In Go, a stack overflow cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics. This issue has been patched in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate strings supplied by users wont create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.8 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The vulnerability description indicates a stack overflow due to input to functions in the `_strvals_` package. |
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | High similarity score, however, memory allocation is an indirect cause. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Input is not properly validated. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that "**Input to functions in the _strvals_ package can cause a stack overflow**." This directly aligns with CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) because a **stack overflow** typically occurs due to excessive or uncontrolled recursion, which consumes the stack memory. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this by stating that fuzz testing identified that certain inputs to functions in the `strvals` package can cause a stack overflow. The impact of exploitation is Denial of Service (DoS), which is also consistent with uncontrolled recursion.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and while it may have more specific Base-level children, the description focuses on the overall uncontrolled recursion leading to a **stack overflow**, making CWE-674 the most appropriate choice. The Retriever Results suggests CWE-674 is relevant, although marked as Allowed-with-Review. Given the specific context of the **stack overflow** and its root cause in input parsing, CWE-674 aligns well.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a variant that describes the product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated. This could be a contributing factor, as the string inputs are parsed into array data structures, potentially allocating excessive memory. However, the primary issue is the uncontrolled recursion, rather than the allocation itself.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-789 is related to CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). Since the vulnerability involves parsing strings into arrays, an excessive size value could exacerbate the **stack overflow** issue. However, it's a secondary concern compared to the uncontrolled recursion itself. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-789 is ALLOWED and is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Supporting evidence, but not the primary cause)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) describes the product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties. This is relevant because the input strings supplied by users are not validated properly, leading to large arrays being created and causing significant memory usage and a **stack overflow**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 is a Base-level CWE. The lack of proper input validation contributes to the vulnerability. However, the core issue remains the **stack overflow** caused by uncontrolled recursion. The Retriever Results identifies CWE-1284 as a potential candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Relevant, but secondary to the primary cause)

## Criticism
Okay, here's a review of the analysis, incorporating the full CWE specifications provided, and focusing on the mapping guidance and potential mitigations:

**Overall Assessment**

The analysis provides a reasonable initial mapping of the Helm vulnerability, but it could be refined for accuracy and specificity.  The primary focus on CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is a good starting point, but the supporting CWEs (CWE-789 and CWE-1284) should be considered more strongly as primary causes or contributing factors, potentially leading to a different main CWE.  The confidence scores are somewhat inflated, especially for CWE-674.

**Detailed Review**

**1. CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion**

*   **Confidence:** Lowering to 0.6 is recommended (was 0.8).
*   **Abstraction Level:** Class
*   **Mapping Guidance:** *Allowed-with-Review*.  This is a *critical* point. The mapping guidance explicitly states that *Base-level children* might be more appropriate.  The current justification for choosing CWE-674 is that the description focuses on the "overall uncontrolled recursion." However, the root cause isn't necessarily recursion itself, but something that *leads to* excessive stack usage which *may* be recursive.
*   **Observed Examples:** The provided observed examples for CVE-674 are relevant but highlight an important consideration: deep nesting and self-referencing pointers. While this vulnerability could exhibit these characteristics, the root cause may still point elsewhere.
*   **Mitigations:** The mitigations for CWE-674 focus on ensuring an end condition is reached or increasing stack size. While these are valid general strategies, they don't directly address the *source* of the problem in this specific vulnerability, which is the parsing and handling of malicious input.
*   **Critique:**  The *description* of CWE-674 says "The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place, consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack."  While stack overflow is mentioned, this vulnerability isn't fundamentally about uncontrolled recursive *function calls*. The *strvals* package parses user-supplied data, and its parsing logic is what leads to memory exhaustion, possibly stack exhaustion, and DoS.  Therefore, while *allowed-with-review* is correct, the review should consider other options more closely. If the input is crafted to produce a deeply nested array, and the array generation code (parsing) recurses to build it, then uncontrolled recursion is more appropriate.

**2. CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**

*   **Confidence:** Increasing to 0.7 is recommended (was 0.6).
*   **Abstraction Level:** Variant
*   **Mapping Guidance:** *Allowed*.  This is also an important point. It is at the Variant level, which is often desired. The extended description, "The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated," fits the described behavior very well.
*   **Relationships:** The specification notes a relationship to CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow).
*   **Mitigations:**  The mitigations are very relevant: "Perform adequate input validation against any value that influences the amount of memory that is allocated."  This directly corresponds to the suggested fix in the vulnerability description: "SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions."
*   **Critique:**  This CWE is more precise than CWE-674. The `strvals` package receives potentially malicious input, doesn't properly validate its size or structure, and then allocates memory based on that untrusted input.  While a stack overflow *can* be a consequence, the immediate cause is excessive memory allocation *on the stack*. The extended description even mentions stack exhaustion as an alternative term.

**3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**

*   **Confidence:** Increasing to 0.8 is recommended (was 0.5). I would consider this the strongest root cause, and make it the primary mapping.
*   **Abstraction Level:** Base
*   **Mapping Guidance:** *Allowed*. This is also key. A base level CWE is a very strong candidate for primary mapping.
*   **Description:** Directly related. The vulnerability occurs when parsing user-supplied input strings. These strings can specify the size and structure of resulting data structures. The fact that the code *does not validate* the quantity (size, length) implied by the input string is the vulnerability.
*   **Relationships:** Can precede CWE-789
*   **Mitigations:** "Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy... When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values..."  Again, this directly aligns with the recommended fix.
*   **Critique:** CWE-1284 is the *most direct* description of the root cause. The input is not validated. This leads to either excessive recursion (CWE-674), excessive memory allocation (CWE-789), or both.

**Additional CWE Considerations**

*   **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**. This Base CWE could also be considered a primary or contributing factor. It describes a situation where a product allocates resources without imposing restrictions, leading to DoS. CWE-789 is a ChildOf CWE-770. The main difference is CWE-770 describes general resource allocation, while CWE-789 is specific to *memory* allocation with an excessive size.

**Revised Mapping Recommendation**

Given the full CWE specifications and the specific details of the Helm vulnerability, I recommend the following mapping:

*   **Primary CWE:** **CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** (Confidence: 0.8) - This is the direct root cause: the input strings are not validated, leading to the allocation of potentially very large data structures.
*   **Secondary CWE:** **CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** (Confidence: 0.7) - This describes how the lack of input validation manifests: by allocating excessive memory based on untrusted input.
*   **Tertiary CWE:** **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** (Confidence: 0.6) - This describes the general resource exhaustion that occurs.
*   **Conditional CWE:** **CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion** (Confidence: 0.4) - Only if the parsing logic is confirmed to be using recursion to build the arrays, which is not explicitly stated.

**Justification for Revised Mapping**

This revised mapping reflects the specific steps in the vulnerability:

1.  The `strvals` package receives untrusted input (CWE-1284).
2.  The code does not validate the size, length, or structure implied by the input (CWE-1284).
3.  Based on the unvalidated input, the code allocates excessive memory (CWE-789).
4.  The excessive memory allocation leads to resource exhaustion and DoS (CWE-770).
5.  Potentially, the process of constructing the large data structures could involve uncontrolled recursion, further exacerbating the stack overflow (CWE-674, conditional).

This revised mapping provides a more accurate and actionable description of the vulnerability and aligns better with the CWE specifications, especially the mapping guidance. By focusing on CWE-1284, developers can directly address the *root cause* by implementing proper input validation, which is also the recommended mitigation.
