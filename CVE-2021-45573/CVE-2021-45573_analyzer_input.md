## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided document describes a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, not a pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability as stated in the document. It is not related to CVE-2021-45573 which is a placeholder.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the document:

**Vulnerability:** Post-Authentication Command Injection

**Affected Products:**

*   R6260 (firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.76)
*   R6800 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62)
*   R6700v2 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62)
*   R6900v2 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62)
*  R7450 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62)
*   AC2100 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62)
*   AC2400 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62)
*   AC2600 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62)

**Root cause of vulnerability**:  The document does not give a specific root cause of the command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present**:  Post-authentication command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation**: The document does not specify the impact of successful exploitation, but command injection vulnerabilities typically allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system, potentially leading to full control of the device, data theft, or other malicious activities. The CVSS score indicates high impact (Confidentiality:High, Integrity:High, Availability: Low).

**Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same local network as the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network (adjacent) and authenticated to exploit the command injection vulnerability.

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

**Mitigation**: The document recommends that users update to the latest firmware version of their devices.
