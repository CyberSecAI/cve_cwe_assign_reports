# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-38599 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that when WAL-G is built without libsodium, it silently uploads backups in **cleartext**, violating the principle of least surprise. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the application's failure to check for libsodium support, leading to **cleartext** backups. This aligns directly with CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), as the backups are stored in **cleartext** on a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere. The fact that backups are transmitted **cleartext** also makes CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) a secondary candidate. Both CWE-312 and CWE-319 are at the Base level of abstraction and have ALLOWED usage according to MITRE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 and CWE-319 are distinct weaknesses, though related by the lack of encryption. CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is a parent Class of both CWE-312 and CWE-319, but it is discouraged because it is a higher-level class and more specific children are available.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of **cleartext** storage and transmission in both the vulnerability description and CVE details.)
