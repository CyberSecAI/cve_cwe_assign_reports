# Critic Input for CVE-2021-38599



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of the official binary releases published as GitHub Releases) is used, silently ignores the libsodium encryption key and uploads cleartext backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation because the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** uploads cleartext backups
- **product:** WAL-G
- **version:** before 1.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `wal-g` application, when built without libsodium support, silently ignored user-specified libsodium encryption keys and uploaded backups in plaintext. This happened because the application did not check if it was compiled with libsodium support before attempting to use libsodium encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Silent Failure:** The application failed silently when it was requested to encrypt data with libsodium but was not compiled with the required support. Instead of throwing an error, it continued to operate, uploading data in plaintext.
- **Principle of Least Surprise violation:** The user expected the backup files to be encrypted due to setting encryption keys, but the application silently ignored them resulting in plaintext backups, violating the principle of least surprise.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application did not properly validate if it had the necessary libsodium support before attempting to use libsodium encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact was the potential for a confidentiality breach. Backups that were intended to be encrypted were instead uploaded as plaintext, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access and exposure.
- **Data Exposure:**  Users who relied on the libsodium encryption were unknowingly exposing their backup data by storing them unencrypted in storage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration Settings:**  An attacker with access to the backup storage could read the unencrypted backups.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** If an attacker had a man-in-the-middle position to intercept the backup transfer, they would be able to read the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the storage location where the backups were stored, or the attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position to intercept the backup transfer.
- No specific user interaction is required.
- No special privileges required

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `wal-g` versions prior to 1.1.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.1. The fix includes a check to ensure that if a libsodium key is specified, and the application is not compiled with libsodium support, the application will exit with an error message.
- The fix also enables libsodium in the GitHub release builds.
- The fix was introduced with the merge of pull request #1062.
- This issue was assigned CVE-2021-38599 and GHSA-vrmr-f2qh-3hhf.
- The issue was classified as having a High severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that when WAL-G is built without libsodium, it silently uploads backups in **cleartext**, violating the principle of least surprise. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the application's failure to check for libsodium support, leading to **cleartext** backups. This aligns directly with CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), as the backups are stored in **cleartext** on a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere. The fact that backups are transmitted **cleartext** also makes CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) a secondary candidate. Both CWE-312 and CWE-319 are at the Base level of abstraction and have ALLOWED usage according to MITRE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 and CWE-319 are distinct weaknesses, though related by the lack of encryption. CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is a parent Class of both CWE-312 and CWE-319, but it is discouraged because it is a higher-level class and more specific children are available.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of **cleartext** storage and transmission in both the vulnerability description and CVE details.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

### Extended Description
The lack of proper data encryption passes up the guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and accountability that properly implemented encryption conveys.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
ParentOf -> CWE-312
ParentOf -> CWE-319

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information or CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Clearly specify which data or resources are valuable enough that they should be protected by encryption. Require that any transmission or storage of this data/resource should use well-vetted encryption algorithms.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Ensure that encryption is properly integrated into the system design, including but not necessarily limited to:


  - Encryption that is needed to store or transmit private data of the users of the system

  - Encryption that is needed to protect the system itself from unauthorized disclosure or tampering

Identify the separate needs and contexts for encryption:

  - One-way (i.e., only the user or recipient needs to have the key). This can be achieved using public key cryptography, or other techniques in which the encrypting party (i.e., the product) does not need to have access to a private key.

  - Two-way (i.e., the encryption can be automatically performed on behalf of a user, but the key must be available so that the plaintext can be automatically recoverable by that user). This requires storage of the private key in a format that is recoverable only by the user (or perhaps by the operating system) in a way that cannot be recovered by others.

Using threat modeling or other techniques, assume that data can be compromised through a separate vulnerability or weakness, and determine where encryption will be most effective. Ensure that data that should be private is not being inadvertently exposed using weaknesses such as insecure permissions (CWE-732). [REF-7]

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

When there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.


For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification.


Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.


Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [REF-267]




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
- **CVE-2009-0152:** chat program disables SSL in some circumstances even when the user says to use SSL.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. 


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ParentOf -> CWE-5
ParentOf -> CWE-614

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Before transmitting, encrypt the data using reliable, confidentiality-protecting cryptographic protocols.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When using web applications with SSL, use SSL for the entire session from login to logout, not just for the initial login page.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When designing hardware platforms, ensure that approved encryption algorithms (such as those recommended by NIST) protect paths from security critical data to trusted user applications.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, System Configuration, Operation
- **Description:** When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to encrypt the data at rest. [REF-1297] [REF-1299] [REF-1301]



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
