| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.6 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **heap buffer overflow** in `radare2`. However, the CVE reference link content summary clarifies that the root cause is actually an **out-of-bounds read** in the macho parser when accessing the symbol table due to a missing bounds check. The code uses `r_symbolnum` to access the symbol table, and if `r_symbolnum` is greater than or equal to `bin->nsymtab`, it results in an out-of-bounds read.
  - The primary weakness is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), as the code reads memory outside the allocated buffer. The initial report mentioned **heap buffer overflow**, and I am keeping it in the secondary list as it could be possible if the address sanitizer is disabled.
  - *CWE Selection:* CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is chosen because the vulnerability involves reading data past the end of the intended buffer (symbol table). The `r_symbolnum` index is not validated against the size of the symbol table (`bin->nsymtab`), leading to the out-of-bounds read. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-125 indicates that this is ALLOWED.
  - *CWE Selection:* CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is chosen because the initial report and vulnerability description key phrases mention a heap buffer overflow. If address sanitizer is disabled, the vulnerability could be exploited as a heap buffer overflow. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-122 indicates that this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-125 can precede CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference), CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Memory), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Numeric Value), and CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a peer of CWE-125, but it is not appropriate because the vulnerability involves reading, not writing.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
