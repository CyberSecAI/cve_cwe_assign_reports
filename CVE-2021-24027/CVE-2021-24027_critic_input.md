## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**cache configuration issue**" that allowed a third party to "read cached TLS material." This directly maps to CWE-524 (Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information), which describes a scenario where "The code uses a cache that contains sensitive information, but the cache can be read by an actor outside of the intended control sphere." The fact that TLS material (a type of sensitive information) was accessible due to a misconfiguration solidifies this mapping. The CWE's description and usage aligns perfectly with the **rootcause** and impact of the vulnerability. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-524 is ALLOWED and is at the Base level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct relationships provided for CWE-524 in the retriever results, the nature of the vulnerability does not necessarily imply any specific preceeding or following CWEs. The vulnerability is primarily about the improper use of a cache.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and CVE summary.)

# CWE Examples from Database


## Known Examples for CWE-524: Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24027**: A cache configuration issue prior to WhatsApp for Android v2.21.4.18 and WhatsApp Business for Android v2.21.4.18 may have allowed a third party with access to the device’s external storage to read cached TLS material.
- **CVE-2021-38378**: OX App Suite 7.10.5 allows Information Exposure because a caching mechanism can caused a Modified By response to show a person's name.
- **CVE-2021-44854**: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x before 1.37.1. The REST API publicly caches results from private wikis.
- **CVE-2022-23498**: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When datasource query caching is enabled, Grafana caches all headers, including `grafana_session`. As a result, any user that queries a datasource where the caching is enabled can acquire another user’s session. To mitigate the vulnerability you can disable datasource query caching for all datasources. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4. 


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-524: Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The code uses a cache that contains sensitive information, but the cache can be read by an actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
Applications may use caches to improve efficiency when communicating with remote entities or performing intensive calculations. A cache maintains a pool of objects, threads, connections, pages, financial data, passwords, or other resources to minimize the time it takes to initialize and access these resources. If the cache is accessible to unauthorized actors, attackers can read the cache and obtain this sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ParentOf -> CWE-525

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Protect information stored in cache.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Do not store unnecessarily sensitive information in the cache.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider using encryption in the cache.
