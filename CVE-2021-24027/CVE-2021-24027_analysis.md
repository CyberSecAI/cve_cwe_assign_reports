| CWE-524 | Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**cache configuration issue**" that allowed a third party to "read cached TLS material." This directly maps to CWE-524 (Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information), which describes a scenario where "The code uses a cache that contains sensitive information, but the cache can be read by an actor outside of the intended control sphere." The fact that TLS material (a type of sensitive information) was accessible due to a misconfiguration solidifies this mapping. The CWE's description and usage aligns perfectly with the **rootcause** and impact of the vulnerability. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-524 is ALLOWED and is at the Base level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct relationships provided for CWE-524 in the retriever results, the nature of the vulnerability does not necessarily imply any specific preceeding or following CWEs. The vulnerability is primarily about the improper use of a cache.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and CVE summary.)
