## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**access of uninitialized pointer**" as the root cause of memory corruption in Bluetooth HOST while processing AVRCP packets. This directly maps to CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer). The description clearly indicates that the pointer being accessed has not been initialized, which leads to memory corruption. CWE-824 is a Base level CWE, making it a suitable choice for root cause analysis.
  CWE-908 is "Use of Uninitialized Resource". While the vulnerability is specifically about an uninitialized pointer, the more general CWE-908 could also be considered as a related weakness.
  CWE-457 is "Use of Uninitialized Variable". Since the uninitialized pointer is essentially an uninitialized variable that holds a memory address, CWE-457 is a potential, though less specific, candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-824 is a base level weakness and is related to other memory corruption issues. It can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) if the uninitialized pointer happens to point to an invalid memory location and a write operation occurs.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the clear statement of the root cause in the vulnerability description and the direct match with CWE-824).

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1619**: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.
- **CVE-2021-41253**: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.
- **CVE-2021-21140**: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.
- **CVE-2021-44003**: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5). The Tiff_Loader.dll is vulnerable to use of uninitialized memory while parsing user supplied TIFF files. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.
