| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**integer overflow**" as the root cause in `rw_t3t_act_handle_check_ndef_rsp` of `rw_t3t.cc`. The CVE reference links confirm "**Integer overflow in `rw_t3t_act_handle_check_ndef_rsp()` function in `rw_t3t.cc`**". This directly aligns with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The impact, according to the description, is an "out of bounds read", which can lead to "remote information disclosure". CWE-190 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for mapping root causes. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-190 indicates it is ALLOWED.
  - *Explanation:* Furthermore, because the **integer overflow** leads to an "out of bounds read", CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is also relevant. The description explicitly states the vulnerability leads to an "out of bounds read". Although the root cause is the **integer overflow**, the direct consequence is reading memory outside the allocated buffer. CWE-125 is also a Base level CWE with ALLOWED mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 can precede CWE-125, as the overflow can lead to incorrect memory access.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference)
