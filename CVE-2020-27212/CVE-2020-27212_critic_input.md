## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that **incorrect access control** allows the degradation of flash read-out protection through **fault injection during the boot phase**. The CVE reference further clarifies that the **root cause** is a flaw in the read-out protection mechanism, allowing attackers to circumvent it via **fault injection**. CWE-1332 (Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips) directly addresses the **weakness** of the device failing to properly handle faults, leading to security-critical instructions being skipped. This aligns perfectly with the described attack scenario where **fault injection** bypasses read-out protection. While CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) and CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) are possible candidates, they are less specific than CWE-1332 in describing the root cause of the **fault injection** vulnerability. The details available emphasize that the core issue lies in the device's inability to handle faults properly during boot. The usage for CWE-1332 is ALLOWED, further supporting its selection.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1332 does not have direct parent or child relationships listed in the provided data. However, it can be inferred that it relates to broader categories such as hardware security and fault tolerance. Given that successful exploitation bypasses access control, it can be reasoned that this weakness can precede CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description mentions the **incorrect access control** and the CVE reference expands on this by explaining a bypass to the readout protection. While fault injection is the method, the fact the protection mechanism can be bypassed through an alternate path or during a specific phase (boot phase) suggests a weakness in how access is controlled on alternate paths. This aligns with the description of CWE-1299, which refers to a lack of protection on alternate paths that allows bypassing existing protections. Given the evidence, the confidence is high.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1299 is related to CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) and CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel). Exploitation of this weakness could lead to CWE-288, as bypassing the readout protection can be seen as an authentication bypass.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. High score in Retriever Results.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) is a potential contributing factor. The fault injection during the boot phase can be viewed as exploiting an unprotected alternate channel to bypass security measures. While not the primary weakness, it represents a related aspect of the vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-420 is PEEROF CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel). If the alternate channel leads to bypassing authentication, there can be an authentication bypass.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Moderate supporting evidence; less direct than CWE-1332 but relevant to the attack vector.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1332: Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The device is missing or incorrectly implements circuitry or sensors that detect and mitigate the skipping of security-critical CPU instructions when they occur.

### Extended Description


The operating conditions of hardware may change in ways that cause unexpected behavior to occur, including the skipping of security-critical CPU instructions. Generally, this can occur due to electrical disturbances or when the device operates outside of its expected conditions.


In practice, application code may contain conditional branches that are security-sensitive (e.g., accepting or rejecting a user-provided password). These conditional branches are typically implemented by a single conditional branch instruction in the program binary which, if skipped, may lead to effectively flipping the branch condition - i.e., causing the wrong security-sensitive branch to be taken. This affects processes such as firmware authentication, password verification, and other security-sensitive decision points.


Attackers can use fault injection techniques to alter the operating conditions of hardware so that security-critical instructions are skipped more frequently or more reliably than they would in a "natural" setting.

## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The lack of protections on alternate paths to access
                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers
                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an
                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are
		only performed against the primary path.

### Extended Description


An asset inside a chip might have access-control protections through one interface. However, if all paths to the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP core, or could be paths from other external-facing interfaces to the IP core or SoC.


Consider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. 


Alternatively, attackers might be able to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security.

- **CVE-2002-0567:** DB server assumes that local clients have performed authentication, allowing attacker to directly connect to a process to load libraries and execute commands; a socket interface also exists (another alternate channel), so attack can be remote.
- **CVE-2002-1578:** Product does not restrict access to underlying database, so attacker can bypass restrictions by directly querying the database.



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

ParentOf -> CWE-732
ParentOf -> CWE-862
ParentOf -> CWE-863
ParentOf -> CWE-926

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the product into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.


Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that you perform access control checks related to your business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that you apply to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.
