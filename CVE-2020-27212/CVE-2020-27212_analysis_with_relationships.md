|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1332 | Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

| CWE-420 | Unprotected Alternate Channel | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that **incorrect access control** allows the degradation of flash read-out protection through **fault injection during the boot phase**. The CVE reference further clarifies that the **root cause** is a flaw in the read-out protection mechanism, allowing attackers to circumvent it via **fault injection**. CWE-1332 (Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips) directly addresses the **weakness** of the device failing to properly handle faults, leading to security-critical instructions being skipped. This aligns perfectly with the described attack scenario where **fault injection** bypasses read-out protection. While CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) and CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) are possible candidates, they are less specific than CWE-1332 in describing the root cause of the **fault injection** vulnerability. The details available emphasize that the core issue lies in the device's inability to handle faults properly during boot. The usage for CWE-1332 is ALLOWED, further supporting its selection.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1332 does not have direct parent or child relationships listed in the provided data. However, it can be inferred that it relates to broader categories such as hardware security and fault tolerance. Given that successful exploitation bypasses access control, it can be reasoned that this weakness can precede CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description mentions the **incorrect access control** and the CVE reference expands on this by explaining a bypass to the readout protection. While fault injection is the method, the fact the protection mechanism can be bypassed through an alternate path or during a specific phase (boot phase) suggests a weakness in how access is controlled on alternate paths. This aligns with the description of CWE-1299, which refers to a lack of protection on alternate paths that allows bypassing existing protections. Given the evidence, the confidence is high.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1299 is related to CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) and CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel). Exploitation of this weakness could lead to CWE-288, as bypassing the readout protection can be seen as an authentication bypass.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. High score in Retriever Results.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) is a potential contributing factor. The fault injection during the boot phase can be viewed as exploiting an unprotected alternate channel to bypass security measures. While not the primary weakness, it represents a related aspect of the vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-420 is PEEROF CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel). If the alternate channel leads to bypassing authentication, there can be an authentication bypass.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Moderate supporting evidence; less direct than CWE-1332 but relevant to the attack vector.)
