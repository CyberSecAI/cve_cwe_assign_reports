# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.6 | Variant | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that a **stack overflow** occurs due to a **bug in the library**. The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause **stack overflow** panics by sending specifically designed queries, which directly aligns with CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is due to the incorrect depth calculation of the MaxDepth option, which allows crafted queries to bypass the intended depth check leading to excessive recursion. CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, however, given the direct description of uncontrolled recursion leading to a stack overflow, it is a reasonable match despite the guidance suggesting to look for a Base-level CWE.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE. There are no direct relationships listed, but uncontrolled recursion can lead to resource exhaustion.

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is considered as a secondary candidate because the **stack overflow** is a consequence of uncontrolled resource allocation, specifically stack space. The vulnerability description notes the attacker can cause **stack overflow** panics. The Retriever Results show that CWE-770 is a Base level, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The relationship between uncontrolled recursion and resource exhaustion makes CWE-770 a plausible secondary mapping.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships listed for CWE-770 in the provided information.

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is considered as a secondary candidate because the stack overflow can be thought of as excessive memory allocation on the stack. The vulnerability description refers to specifically designed queries causing **stack overflow**s.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-789 is a variant of improper resource management.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence based on the description of stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion.)
