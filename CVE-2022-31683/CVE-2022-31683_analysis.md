# Analysis for CVE-2022-31683

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability involves manipulating the `team_name` parameter to bypass authorization checks, aligning with the CWE's description of gaining unauthorized access by modifying key values. |
| CWE-235 | Improper Handling of Extra Parameters | 0.65 | Variant | Allowed | The vulnerability involves HTTP parameter pollution, where extra parameters in the request body override URL parameters, which is directly related to the description of this CWE. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states an **authorization bypass issue** where a Concourse user can manipulate the `team_name` parameter to gain access to resources belonging to other teams. The CVE reference summary details how the application uses `FormValue` which is susceptible to HTTP parameter pollution, allowing attackers to override URL parameters with those in the request body. This directly aligns with CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), where authorization is bypassed by modifying a key value (in this case, `team_name`) controlled by the user. The use of `FormValue` and the resulting HTTP parameter pollution also suggests CWE-235 (Improper Handling of Extra Parameters) since the application doesn't properly handle or validate the presence of multiple parameters with the same name."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-639 is a Base level CWE which aligns with the level of detail provided in the vulnerability description. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) are related, they are Class level CWEs and less specific than CWE-639. CWE-235 describes how improper handling of extra parameters leads to overriding of one parameter over the other. "

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)
