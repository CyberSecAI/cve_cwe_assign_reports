## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Concourse parses the `:team_name` parameter in certain API endpoints. It uses `FormValue` which allows HTTP parameter pollution, where parameters in the request body take precedence over those in the URL, instead of using `URL.Query().Get()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTTP Parameter Pollution:** The application uses `FormValue` to extract parameters, making it susceptible to parameter pollution, where a malicious user can override URL parameters by providing the same parameter in the request body.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability allows a user to bypass team scope checks by manipulating the `team_name` parameter. This indicates a weakness in how access permissions are enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** An attacker can gain access to and manipulate resources (pipelines, jobs, resources) belonging to a team they are not authorized to access.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker can perform actions such as pausing/unpausing pipelines, scheduling jobs, and enabling/disabling resources across different teams without proper authorization.
- **Data Modification/Manipulation:** The ability to control resources could allow an attacker to modify data or cause operational disruptions by pausing pipelines, or creating artifacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST/PUT Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted POST or PUT requests to specific API endpoints that include `:team_name` in the URL.
- **Request Body Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the request body by including `:team_name=target_team`, thus overriding the `:team_name` parameter in the URL.
- `fly curl` is used in the example to create and send the crafted requests

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid User Session:** The attacker needs to have a valid user session in the Concourse instance.
- **Membership in Any Team:** The attacker must belong to at least one team in the Concourse deployment.
- **Knowledge of Target Team:** The attacker needs to know the name of the target team to which they want to gain unauthorized access.
- **Network Access:** Requires network access to interact with the Concourse API.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specific vulnerable endpoints and a step-by-step reproduction example using `fly`.
- The patch implemented uses `URL.Query().Get()` which retrieves parameters only from the URL, preventing the body from overriding URL parameters.
- Affected versions are `<7.8.2`, with patched versions released as `6.7.9` and `7.8.3`.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states an **authorization bypass issue** where a Concourse user can manipulate the `team_name` parameter to gain access to resources belonging to other teams. The CVE reference summary details how the application uses `FormValue` which is susceptible to HTTP parameter pollution, allowing attackers to override URL parameters with those in the request body. This directly aligns with CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), where authorization is bypassed by modifying a key value (in this case, `team_name`) controlled by the user. The use of `FormValue` and the resulting HTTP parameter pollution also suggests CWE-235 (Improper Handling of Extra Parameters) since the application doesn't properly handle or validate the presence of multiple parameters with the same name."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-639 is a Base level CWE which aligns with the level of detail provided in the vulnerability description. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) are related, they are Class level CWEs and less specific than CWE-639. CWE-235 describes how improper handling of extra parameters leads to overriding of one parameter over the other. "

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This type of problem has a big role in multiple interpretation vulnerabilities and various HTTP attacks.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-1014:** MIE. multiple gateway/security products allow restriction bypass using multiple MIME fields with the same name, which are interpreted differently by clients.



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the product into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.


Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that you perform access control checks related to your business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that you apply to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
