| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack-based buffer overflow**" as the weakness, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. It occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer." This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant-level CWE and appropriate for this type of vulnerability. The impact is the ability to "execute arbitrary code", which is a typical consequence of a buffer overflow. MITRE mapping guidance allows for CWE-121.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No specific relationships were identified that would change the assessment. CWE-121 is a variant of a buffer overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of stack-based buffer overflow and confirmation in the CVE summary)
