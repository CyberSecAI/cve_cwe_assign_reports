|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack-based buffer overflow**" as the weakness, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. It occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer." This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant-level CWE and appropriate for this type of vulnerability. The impact is the ability to "execute arbitrary code", which is a typical consequence of a buffer overflow. MITRE mapping guidance allows for CWE-121.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No specific relationships were identified that would change the assessment. CWE-121 is a variant of a buffer overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of stack-based buffer overflow and confirmation in the CVE summary)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11267**: Stack out-of-bounds write occurs while setting up a cipher device if the provided IV length exceeds the max limit value in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking
- **CVE-2020-11633**: The Zscaler Client Connector for Windows prior to 2.1.2.74 had a stack based buffer overflow when connecting to misconfigured TLS servers. An adversary would potentially have been able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **CVE-2020-12893**: Stack Buffer Overflow in AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10 in Escape 0x15002a may lead to escalation of privilege or denial of service.
- **CVE-2020-12898**: Stack Buffer Overflow in AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10 may lead to escalation of privilege or denial of service.
- **CVE-2020-13598**: FS: Buffer Overflow when enabling Long File Names in FAT_FS and calling fs_stat. Zephyr versions >= v1.14.2, >= v2.3.0 contain Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121). For more information, see https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-7fhv-rgxr-x56h
- **CVE-2020-15744**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the ONVIF server component of Victure PC420 smart camera allows an attacker to execute remote code on the target device. This issue affects: Victure PC420 firmware version 1.2.2 and prior versions.
- **CVE-2020-17541**: Libjpeg-turbo all version have a stack-based buffer overflow in the "transform" component. A remote attacker can send a malformed jpeg file to the service and cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service of the target service.
- **CVE-2020-18734**: A stack buffer overflow in /ddsi/q_bitset.h of Eclipse IOT Cyclone DDS Project v0.1.0 causes the DDS subscriber server to crash.
- **CVE-2020-18971**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow in PoDoFo v0.9.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via the component 'src/base/PdfDictionary.cpp:65'.
