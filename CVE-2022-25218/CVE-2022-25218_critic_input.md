# Critic Input for CVE-2022-25218



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
The use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP, or any other padding scheme, in telnetd_startup, allows an unauthenticated attacker on the local area network to achieve a significant degree of control over the plaintext to which an arbitrary blob of ciphertext will be decrypted by OpenSSLs RSA_public_decrypt() function. This weakness allows the attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd startup state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device, by means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but K2 22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires the exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219).

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-25218.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the flawed implementation of the `telnetd_startup` backdoor protocol in Phicomm routers. This backdoor is designed to allow a client with a specific RSA private key to launch a telnet service for remote access. The vulnerability arises from the server-side logic, where the server decrypts an encrypted message using a hardcoded public RSA key and then XORs the decrypted data with a secret plaintext to generate an ephemeral password. Due to the use of `sprintf` with the `%s` format specifier, a carefully crafted encrypted message can produce a null byte at the beginning of the XORed data. This results in an empty string when the XORed data is used to construct the ephemeral password, leading to a predictable password that allows unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Backdoor:** The `telnetd_startup` service, intended for backdoor access, is not properly secured.
2.  **Flawed Cryptographic Implementation:** The use of a hardcoded public key and the flawed handling of decrypted data in the ephemeral password generation process are major weaknesses.
3.  **Predictable Password Generation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to force a predictable password by crafting a specific encrypted payload, resulting in a null byte injection.
4.  **Lack of Rate Limiting:** There's no rate limiting mechanism, allowing an attacker to repeatedly try to connect to the backdoor to exploit this vulnerability.
5.  **Hardcoded Credentials:** The content also mentions hardcoded credentials ("root:admin") for the UART console in K3C routers, which can be used by attackers with physical access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of the `telnetd_startup` vulnerability allows an attacker to:

*   Gain a root shell on the affected device.
*   Execute arbitrary commands on the router.
*   Completely control the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker on the local network can exploit the `telnetd_startup` vulnerability by sending specifically crafted UDP packets to port 21210.
*   **Physical Access (UART Console):** An attacker with physical access to K3C routers can exploit the unprotected UART console with hardcoded credentials to gain root access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:** For exploiting the `telnetd_startup` backdoor, an attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
*   **Physical Access:** To exploit the UART console vulnerability, an attacker needs physical access to the router device.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is the **use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding)**, as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description. This directly corresponds to CWE-780, "Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP." The vulnerability description explicitly states, "The use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP, or any other padding scheme, in telnetd_startup...". This lack of padding allows for manipulation of the plaintext during decryption. CWE-780 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance allows this CWE for this type of vulnerability.
  - The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the **flawed cryptographic implementation** due to the **use of a hardcoded public key** and the flawed handling of decrypted data. This can be attributed to the hardcoded key used for decryption, which could be classified as CWE-798, "Use of Hard-coded Credentials." This contributes to the overall vulnerability by making the system reliant on a key that is not dynamically generated or securely managed.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-780 is a variant of CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). CWE-780 is the more specific weakness, and thus more appropriate than the class CWE-327.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and supporting evidence.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-780: Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses the RSA algorithm but does not incorporate Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), which might weaken the encryption.

### Extended Description
Padding schemes are often used with cryptographic algorithms to make the plaintext less predictable and complicate attack efforts. The OAEP scheme is often used with RSA to nullify the impact of predictable common text.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-327

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could probably have a new parent related to improper padding, however the role of padding in cryptographic algorithms can vary, such as hiding the length of the plaintext and providing additional random bits for the cipher. In general, cryptographic problems in CWE are not well organized and further research is needed.





## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1391
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-344
ChildOf -> CWE-671
PeerOf -> CWE-257
ParentOf -> CWE-259
ParentOf -> CWE-321

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access



## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

When there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.


For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification [REF-1192].


Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.


Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [REF-267]


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Description:** Ensure that the design allows one cryptographic algorithm to be replaced with another in the next generation or version. Where possible, use wrappers to make the interfaces uniform. This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms. With hardware, design the product at the Intellectual Property (IP) level so that one cryptographic algorithm can be replaced with another in the next generation of the hardware product.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys (see CWE-320). If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography itself is irrelevant.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
