  "description": "In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26920:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the way Apache Druid's HTTP InputSource handles data retrieval. It allows authenticated users to read data from unintended sources. Specifically, users can supply file URLs to the HTTP InputSource.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Insecure Input Handling:** The HTTP InputSource does not properly validate the provided URL, allowing access to local files.\n- **Bypass of Application-Level Restrictions:** When an application restricts users from accessing certain InputSources (like Local), users can still access local files by using the HTTP InputSource with a `file://` URL.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n- **Bypass access control:** By using the HTTP InputSource an attacker could potentially bypass application-level restrictions on access to the local file system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Users can supply a specially crafted URL to the HTTP InputSource, specifying local files using the `file://` URI scheme.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker must be an authenticated user of Apache Druid.\n- The attacker does not require any special privilege within Druid.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The provided text indicates that the fix for this issue in 0.21.0 was incomplete and a second CVE (CVE-2021-36749) was issued to address the same vulnerability that was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n- The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to version 0.22.0 or higher. In earlier versions, applications should disallow the Local, HTTP, and HDFS InputSources if local file system access needs to be restricted.",

  "criticism": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided analysis and the full CWE specifications for each referenced weakness. Here's my critique, focusing on the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of the CWE assignments, considering the mapping guidance and potential mitigations:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe analysis is generally good and identifies the core vulnerabilities. However, there's room for improvement in terms of precision and fully leveraging the CWE specifications. The primary CWE, CWE-610, while applicable, is a high-level Class and the analysis recognizes this and seeks to justify it. The secondary CWE, CWE-22, is a valid, although it may be considered a consequence of the broader weakness.\n\n**Detailed Critique:**\n\n**1. Primary CWE: CWE-610: Use of an Externally-Controlled Name to Select a Resource or File**\n\n*   **Confidence:** 0.75 (Good, but could be refined)\n*   **Abstraction Level:** Class (Discouraged)\n*   **Justification:** The analysis correctly identifies that the HTTP InputSource uses an externally controlled name (the URL) to resolve a resource, and it extends to resources that are outside the intended control sphere.\n*   **Critique:**\n    *   **Discouraged Usage:** The analysis mentions that CWE-610 is DISCOURAGED due to its Class level. While the justification provided is reasonable (that no specific child CWE fully captures the broader resource access issue), I suggest exploring *CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path* first.\n\n*   **Why CWE-73 might be better:**\n    *   CWE-73 is a *Base* level CWE, which is preferred.\n    *   The description of CWE-73 closely aligns with the vulnerability: \"The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\"  The \"file://\" URL directly controls the path used in a file system operation.\n    *   CWE-73 is a *child* of CWE-610, so in a way, this provides even more specificity. It provides a more precise way of expressing the type of resource.\n\n*   **Mitigation Overlap:** The mitigations for CWE-73 are directly applicable (mapping from fixed IDs to filenames, sandboxing). Mitigations for CWE-610 are too broad.\n*   **Recommendation:** Re-evaluate the primary CWE as CWE-73. The confidence score should remain the same, or possibly increase, because it is a more exact fit.\n\n**2. Secondary CWE: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**\n\n*   **Confidence:** 0.65 (Acceptable)\n*   **Abstraction Level:** Base (Allowed)\n*   **Justification:** The analysis correctly identifies that the file URL could potentially be manipulated to traverse directories.\n*   **Critique:**\n    *   **Consequence:** CWE-22 is a consequence of the improper control of the filename (as described by CWE-73) *if* the attacker uses \"../\" or similar sequences in the \"file://\" URL. It's not the core weakness *unless* we are specifically discussing the ability to do *relative path traversal*. The file URL could specify an absolute path, which would also circumvent intended restrictions but would not be relative path traversal.\n*   **Recommendation:** Keep CWE-22 as a secondary CWE, but only if path traversal using \"..\" sequences is explicitly discussed. It's a potential *impact* but not always the root cause if a full path is provided. Reduce the confidence score slightly (e.g., 0.60). The most effective use case for CWE-22 is if the program attempts to sanitize path names to prevent path traversal and fails to fully neutralize all path traversal sequences.\n\n**3. Consideration of Other CWEs (from Retriever Results):**\n\nThe Retriever Results suggest other potentially relevant CWEs. Let's examine a few:\n\n*   **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization:** The weakness described allows an authenticated user to access parts of the file system that they are not meant to access through the unintended use of a separate protocol (HTTP InputSource). This could be the secondary CWE, but *only* if there is specific access control logic intended to prevent them from accessing the local file system.\n*   **CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'):** This would be relevant if the `file://` URL resolved to a symbolic link.\n*   **CWE-1289 Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input:** This could be used if the URL is checked to see if it's on the allowlist, and the program checks the URL incorrectly by failing to canonicalize the URL correctly. Example: `http://example.com` vs `http://example.com/./`\n\n**4. Mapping Guidance and Potential Mitigations:**\n\n*   **CWE-610/CWE-73 Mitigations:** The mitigation strategies outlined in CWE-73 (and, to a lesser extent, CWE-610) are relevant. The most important are:\n    *   **Mapping input values to filenames:** Only allow a pre-defined set of HTTP InputSources to be used.\n    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the Druid ingestion process within a \"jail\" that restricts file system access.\n    *   **Stringent input validation:** Use allowlists to validate filenames, limiting the character sets to be used.\n*   **CWE-22 Mitigations:** Stringent input validation to prevent \"..\" sequences. Use canonicalization functions (e.g., `realpath()`) to remove path traversal elements.\n\n**Revised Analysis Summary:**\n\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.75 | Base | Primary | Allows authenticated users to read data from unintended sources, such as the local file system, by specifying file URLs to the HTTP InputSource. |\n| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.60 | Base | Secondary | Only applicable if attacker can influence portions of the file path that would lead to path traversal. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.5 | Class | Additional | Possible if the authorization scheme fails to account for the local file system. |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe original analysis provided a reasonable, though not perfect, assessment. Replacing CWE-610 with CWE-73 will improve the accuracy and practical value of the analysis. The confidence level is valid and the explanation provides an adequate description of how the vulnerability manifests. Overall, the assessment is pretty good, but would be further enhanced by specifically mentioning the possibility of SSRF and how to prevent it.",
  "resolution": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.75 | Base | Primary CWE | Allows authenticated users to read data from unintended sources, such as the local file system, by specifying file URLs to the HTTP InputSource. |\n| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.60 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Only applicable if attacker can influence portions of the file path that would lead to path traversal. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary change involves shifting from CWE-610 to CWE-73. CWE-73 is a child of CWE-610, representing a more specific case of external control focused on filenames and paths. This aligns with the vulnerability where the file URL directly influences file system operations. CWE-22 remains a secondary concern, contingent on the presence of path traversal attempts within the file URL.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Use of an Externally-Controlled Name to Select a Resource or File\"]\n    \n    cwe73 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe73 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe610 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **CWE-73** [External Control of File Name or Path], where the HTTP InputSource allows user-controlled URLs. This leads to the potential for reading arbitrary files on the system. If the URL includes path traversal sequences, it can further result in **CWE-22** [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')], allowing access to files outside the intended directories. The final impact is the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core issues but used a less specific CWE. The criticism highlighted the appropriateness of CWE-73 as a **ROOTCAUSE**, given its focus on file paths and the vulnerability's direct manipulation of file system operations via URLs.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process...users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource.\" This directly supports **CWE-73** [External Control of File Name or Path] since the user is controlling the file path.\n\nCWE-73 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. Furthermore, mitigations for CWE-73, such as input validation and sandboxing, are directly applicable to this vulnerability.\n\nThe decision to switch to CWE-73 is based on its greater specificity and alignment with the vulnerability description, making it a more accurate representation of the **WEAKNESS**. CWE-22 remains a secondary concern contingent on path traversal attempts.",
