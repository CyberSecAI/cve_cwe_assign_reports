# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-610 | Use of an Externally-Controlled Name to Select a Resource or File | 0.75 | Class | Primary | Allows authenticated users to read data from unintended sources, such as the local file system, by specifying file URLs to the HTTP InputSource. |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.65 | Base | Secondary | Allows users to bypass application-level restrictions by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description details that the Druid ingestion system's HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from unintended sources, including the local file system, by using file URLs. This aligns with CWE-610 [Use of an Externally-Controlled Name to Select a Resource or File] because the **InputSource uses an externally controlled name (the URL) to resolve a resource that is outside the intended control sphere (the allowed data sources)**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability arises from **insecure input handling of the URL**, allowing access to local files. CWE-610 is a Class-level CWE, but it aptly describes the high-level weakness of using an externally controlled name to access unintended resources. The Retriever Results also include CWE-610, but it is marked as DISCOURAGED for mapping because it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. However, in this case, the broader scope of resource access makes it suitable. The secondary CWE is CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')] since the **file URL could be manipulated to traverse directories**, although this is more of a consequence than the primary weakness."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-610 is a Class, and while it could have more specific children, none fully capture the essence of using an externally controlled resource name. It is related to CWE-73 [External Control of File Name or Path], but CWE-610 is more specific to the use of external names. CWE-22 is a potential consequence of the vulnerability if the file URL is not properly sanitized, leading to path traversal."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, with consideration of CWE abstraction levels)
