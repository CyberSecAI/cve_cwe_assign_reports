# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21859

## Vulnerability Description
An exploitable **integer truncation** vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. The stri_box_read function is used when processing atoms using the stri FOURCC code. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer truncation**
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** GPAC Project
- **version:** Advanced Content library v1.0.1
