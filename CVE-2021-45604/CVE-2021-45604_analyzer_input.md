## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability. It does not mention CVE-2021-45604, but refers to it by the internal NETGEAR ID **PSV-2020-0572**

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Post-authentication stack overflow

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory indicates a high impact on availability (A:H) which implies the vulnerability can cause a denial of service.
- CVSS does not mention impacts to confidentiality or integrity.
- Overall impact is described as "Medium".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) implying the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- Low attack complexity (AC:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to have high privileges on the device (PR:H). This implies the attacker has already authenticated to the device and has administrative access.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N)
