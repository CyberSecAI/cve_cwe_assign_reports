# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                      | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | 0.85      | Base                  | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the **improper type validation** of objects created after loading data to the `config.xml` REST API endpoint. This allows an attacker to replace a node with one of a different type, indicating a failure to validate the specified type of input. The description explicitly mentions the **rootcause** as **improper type validation**, which aligns with CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input). The "Retriever Results" lists CWE-1287 with a high combined score (0.4446), further supporting this mapping. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1287 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1287 is a Base level CWE, providing a good level of specificity for this **rootcause**. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) could be considered, CWE-1287 is more specific, focusing on type validation. There are no direct parent-child relationships impacting this decision, but CWE-1287 is PEEROF CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37032](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37032): Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

- **CVE-2008-2223** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2223](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2223): SQL injection through an ID that was supposed to be numeric.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21639**: Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier does not validate the type of object created after loading the data submitted to the `config.xml` REST API endpoint of a node, allowing attackers with Computer/Configure permission to replace a node with one of a different type.
- **CVE-2021-20329**: Specific cstrings input may not be properly validated in the MongoDB Go Driver when marshalling Go objects into BSON. A malicious user could use a Go object with specific string to potentially inject additional fields into marshalled documents. This issue affects all MongoDB GO Drivers prior to and including 1.5.0. 
- **CVE-2021-29486**: cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library). Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.
- **CVE-2022-22228**: An Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause an RPD memory leak leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This memory leak only occurs when the attacker's packets are destined to any configured IPv6 address on the device. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S2; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.1R1.
- **CVE-2022-32226**: An improper access control vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5, <v4.8.2 and <v4.7.5 due to input data in the getUsersOfRoom Meteor server method is not type validated, so that MongoDB query operator objects are accepted by the server, so that instead of a matching rid String a$regex query can be executed, bypassing the room access permission check for every but the first matching room.
- **CVE-2021-0600**: In onCreate of DeviceAdminAdd.java, there is a possible way to mislead a user to activate a device admin app due to improper input validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-8.1 Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-179042963
- **CVE-2021-38455**: The affected productâ€™s OS Service does not verify any given parameter. A user can supply any type of parameter that will be passed to inner calls without checking the type of the parameter or the value.
- **CVE-2021-43802**: Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor. In versions prior to 1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state. More detailed information and general mitigation strategies may be found in the GitHub Security Advisory.
