# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-39134

## Vulnerability Description
`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency specifiers defined in `package.json` manifests for dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to resolve conflicting dependencies. When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborists internal data structure saw them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy. However, on case-insensitive file systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined with a symlink dependency such as `file/some/path`, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the filesystem. For example, a package `pwn-a` could define a dependency in their `package.json` file such as `foo file/some/path`. Another package, `pwn-b` could define a dependency such as `FOO filefoo.tgz`. On case-insensitive file systems, if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the contents of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existing contents of `/some/path` would be removed. Anyone using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **case-insensitive filesystem, symlink dependency**
- **impact:** arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the filesystem
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** @npmcli/arborist
- **version:** 7.20.6 or earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39134:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly references `CVE-2021-39134`, and the description aligns with the official description regarding case-insensitive file systems, symlink dependencies, and arbitrary file overwrite.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from `@npmcli/arborist` incorrectly handling dependencies with names differing only in case on case-insensitive file systems.
*   Arborist's internal data structures treated `foo` and `FOO` as distinct packages.
*   This, combined with symlink dependencies (`file:/some/path`), creates a scenario where installing a package could overwrite files in arbitrary locations.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Case-Insensitive File Systems:** The library incorrectly handles package names that differ only in case, leading to conflicts.
*   **Symlink Following:** The vulnerability is triggered by using symlink dependencies, which allows for writing to arbitrary locations when combined with the case-insensitivity issue.
*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite existing files/directories in the filesystem.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite any file in the file system with arbitrary content by utilizing the dependency resolution flaw.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting configuration files or other sensitive files, an attacker might be able to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted `package.json` files containing dependencies with names differing only in case and a symlink dependency using the `file:` protocol.
*   Installing these crafted packages on a case-insensitive file system (macOS, Windows) triggers the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to create and publish malicious packages to a public or private npm registry, or be able to convince a user to install a malicious package.
*   The target system must have a case-insensitive file system (macOS, Windows) and use a vulnerable version of npm (<= 7.20.6).

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix in `@npmcli/arborist` version 2.8.2 includes:
    *   Moving aside target folders that are not directories prior to extraction.
    *   Replacing the `children` map with a case-insensitive map object to detect name collisions.
*   A caveat is mentioned on case-*sensitive* filesystems, in the rare edge case where two packages exist with case different names, which could lead to issues, recommending an npm update to regenerate the package-lock.json file.
