|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **stack-based buffer overflow** [CWE-121] in the CA sign functionality of FortiWeb. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution via a specifically crafted password. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states the root cause as a **stack-based buffer overflow**. CWE-121, Stack-based Buffer Overflow, is a Variant-level CWE that accurately describes the **weakness**. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-121.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack-based buffer overflow" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary.)
