# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-45972

## Vulnerability Description
The giftrans function in giftrans 1.12.2 contains a **stack-based buffer overflow** because a value inside the input file determines the amount of data to write. This allows an attacker to overwrite up to 250 bytes outside of the allocated buffer with arbitrary data.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** overwrite up to 250 bytes outside of the allocated buffer with arbitrary data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** giftrans
- **version:** 1.12.2
- **component:** giftrans function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `giftrans` function of the `giftrans` application.
- The vulnerability occurs when processing a Graphic Control Extension block within a GIF image. The size of the extension data is read directly from the image file, without any size validation, and then this read size is used to copy data into a fixed-size buffer.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `gce` buffer, declared on the stack with a size of 5 bytes, is overflowed because the size read from the input file can be larger than 5, leading to overwriting of adjacent stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The provided example demonstrates that an attacker-controlled GIF file can trigger a crash of the `giftrans` application due to the detected buffer overflow.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly demonstrated here, stack buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the data being written to the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious GIF file:**  The attacker crafts a GIF file with a Graphic Control Extension block containing a size value larger than 5.
- **Processing with vulnerable giftrans:** When a user processes the malicious GIF file using the vulnerable `giftrans` application, the overflow occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft a malicious GIF file:** The attacker must be able to create or modify a GIF file with the specific structure required to trigger the overflow.
- **User Interaction:** The user must process the malicious GIF using the vulnerable `giftrans` utility.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided bug report includes a proof-of-concept python script to create a malicious GIF that demonstrates the vulnerability.
- A patch has been created which introduced a size check to prevent buffer overflow, which checks if the size value read from image file is greater than 5, and if it is, the program returns.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-45972.
