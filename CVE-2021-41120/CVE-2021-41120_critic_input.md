# Critic Input for CVE-2021-41120



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
sylius/paypal-plugin is a paypal plugin for the Sylius development platform. In affected versions the **URL to the payment page done after checkout was created with autoincremented payment id (/pay-with-paypal/{id})** and therefore it was easy to predict. The problem is that the Credit card form has prefilled credit card holder field with the Customers first and last name and hence this can lead to personally identifiable information exposure. Additionally, the mentioned form did not require authentication. The problem has been patched in Sylius/PayPalPlugin 1.2.4 and 1.3.1. If users are unable to update they can override a sylius_paypal_plugin_pay_with_paypal_form route and change its URL parameters to (for example) {orderToken}/{paymentId}, then override the Sylius\PayPalPlugin\Controller\PayWithPayPalFormAction service, to operate on the payment taken from the repository by these 2 values. It would also require usage of custom repository method. Additionally, one could override the @SyliusPayPalPlugin/payWithPaypal.html.twig template, to add contingencies [SCA_ALWAYS] line in hostedFields.submit(...) function call (line 421). It would then have to be handled in the function callback.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **URL to the payment page done after checkout was created with autoincremented payment id (/pay-with-paypal/{id})**
- **weakness:** **sensitive information exposure**
- **impact:** prefilled credit card holder field with the Customers first and last name
- **product:** sylius/paypal-plugin
- **version:** before 1.2.4 and 1.3.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The payment page URL was generated using an auto-incremented payment ID, making it easily accessible to unauthorized users. The URL pattern was `/pay-with-paypal/{id}`.
*   The credit card form on the payment page pre-filled the "credit card holder" field with the customer's first and last name.
*   The credit card form lacked 3D Secure authentication, or any checks on the 3D Secure authentication result.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The use of sequential, easily guessable payment IDs in the URL allows unauthorized access to payment pages.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The pre-filling of the cardholder name field exposes the customer's personal information.
*   **Missing Security Functionality:** The absence of 3D Secure authentication and related checks creates a security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized access to payment forms, allowing malicious actors to view a customer's name.
*   Potential for unauthorized charges. Attackers could try to complete the payment using a stolen credit card.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Direct access to the payment page through brute-forcing or guessing the payment ID.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to guess or brute-force the auto-incrementing payment ID.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerable URL structure.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Sylius/PayPalPlugin versions >= 1.0.0 || >= 1.1.0 || >= 1.2.0 < 1.2.3 || 1.3.0.
*   Patched versions are 1.2.4 and 1.3.1.
*   The fix included changing the route to `/pay-with-paypal/{orderToken}/{paymentId}`.
*   The fix also implemented 3D secure authentication by adding `contingencies: ['SCA_ALWAYS']` to the `hostedFields.submit()` call.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-213.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is that the **URL to the payment page was created with an autoincremented payment ID (/pay-with-paypal/{id})**, allowing easy prediction and unauthorized access. This directly relates to **CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]**, because the payment ID acts as a key to access the payment information and the system's authorization doesn't prevent access to other users' data by modifying this key. The 'CVE Reference Links Content Summary' section also identifies **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**, which aligns with CWE-639. MITRE's mapping guidance designates CWE-639 as ALLOWED at the Base level, fitting the vulnerability's root cause.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The **impact** of this vulnerability includes a prefilled credit card holder field with the Customer's first and last name leading to a **sensitive information exposure**. This aligns with **CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data]**, as the customer's name is being transmitted in the payment form without proper authorization or protection. While **CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]** could be considered, it is discouraged by MITRE as it represents the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-201 better reflects the insertion of sensitive data into the sent data.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (Supporting evidence of sensitive data exposure but less direct than the primary weakness.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The description mentions that the mentioned form did not require authentication. This relates to **CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function]**, because the payment form lacked authentication, which is a critical security control.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Supporting evidence of missing authentication)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that any possibly sensitive data specified in the requirements is verified with designers to ensure that it is either a calculated risk or mitigated elsewhere. Any information that is not necessary to the functionality should be removed in order to lower both the overhead and the possibility of security sensitive data being sent.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** System Configuration
- **Description:** Setup default error messages so that unexpected errors do not disclose sensitive information.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.
