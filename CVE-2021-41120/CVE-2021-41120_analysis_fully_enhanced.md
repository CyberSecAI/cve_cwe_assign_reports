|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is that the **URL to the payment page was created with an autoincremented payment ID (/pay-with-paypal/{id})**, allowing easy prediction and unauthorized access. This directly relates to **CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]**, because the payment ID acts as a key to access the payment information and the system's authorization doesn't prevent access to other users' data by modifying this key. The 'CVE Reference Links Content Summary' section also identifies **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**, which aligns with CWE-639. MITRE's mapping guidance designates CWE-639 as ALLOWED at the Base level, fitting the vulnerability's root cause.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The **impact** of this vulnerability includes a prefilled credit card holder field with the Customer's first and last name leading to a **sensitive information exposure**. This aligns with **CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data]**, as the customer's name is being transmitted in the payment form without proper authorization or protection. While **CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]** could be considered, it is discouraged by MITRE as it represents the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-201 better reflects the insertion of sensitive data into the sent data.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (Supporting evidence of sensitive data exposure but less direct than the primary weakness.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The description mentions that the mentioned form did not require authentication. This relates to **CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function]**, because the payment form lacked authentication, which is a critical security control.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Supporting evidence of missing authentication)



## Known Examples for CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539): An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26679**: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as "profile pictures." The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.
- **CVE-2021-41847**: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.
- **CVE-2021-22906**: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.
- **CVE-2021-21012**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **CVE-2021-21013**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the customer API module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure and update arbitrary information on another user's account.
- **CVE-2021-21022**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the product module. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
- **CVE-2021-21255**: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- **CVE-2021-24318**: The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.
- **CVE-2021-26024**: The Favorites component before 1.0.2 for Nagios XI 5.8.0 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference: it is possible to create favorites for any other user account.
