# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-2991

## Vulnerability Description
A **heap-based buffer overflow** was found in the Linux kernels LightNVM subsystem. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data** prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data**
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution
- **attacker:** local attacker
- **product:** Linux kernels
- **component:** LightNVM subsystem
