# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-43522

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.1 through 2021-11-08, 5.2 through 2021-11-08, and 5.3 through 2021-11-08. A StorageSecurityCommandDxe SMM **memory corruption** vulnerability allows an attacker to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **impact:** escalating privileges to SMM
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Insyde InsydeH2O
- **version:** kernel 5.1 through 2021-11-08, 5.2 through 2021-11-08, and 5.3 through 2021-11-08
- **component:** StorageSecurityCommandDxe

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the `StorageSecurityCommandDxe` module in InsydeH2O UEFI firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SMM Memory Corruption: The `StorageSecurityCommandDxe` module allows an attacker to write fixed or predictable data to System Management RAM (SMRAM).
- Out-of-Bounds Write: The specific mechanism of the memory corruption is an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining elevated privileges within the System Management Mode (SMM), which operates at a higher privilege level than the operating system. This could allow an attacker to control the system at the firmware level.
- Potential for Data Modification/Disclosure/DoS: According to the NetApp advisory, exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, data modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: Exploitation requires local access to the system, as indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:L`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker requires high privileges on the system in order to trigger the vulnerability (`PR:H`) .
- The attacker needs to run untrusted code on affected systems.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability impacts InsydeH2O firmware kernel versions 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 (until 2021-11-08).
- The Siemens advisory provides a more comprehensive list of affected products (including those from Siemens) than the NetApp advisory, which states none of their products are affected.
- The Siemens advisory includes the CVSS score of 7.5 (High) for the vulnerability, with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
- The Siemens advisory lists CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the relevant CWE.
