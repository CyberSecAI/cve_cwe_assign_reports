## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Junos Space Network Management Platform **stores shared secrets in a recoverable format**. This aligns directly with CWE-257 "Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format". The description also mentions that an attacker could obtain a copy of credentials, further solidifying this mapping. The Retriever Results also list CWE-257 as the top match. The CWE description for CWE-257 mentions that "the storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks." This directly applies to the vulnerability described. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-257 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships are found for CWE-257.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and Retriever Results)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0220**: The Junos Space Network Management Platform has been found to store shared secrets in a recoverable format that can be exposed through the UI. An attacker who is able to execute arbitrary code in the victim browser (for example via XSS) or access cached contents may be able to obtain a copy of credentials managed by Junos Space. The impact of a successful attack includes, but is not limited to, obtaining access to other servers connected to the Junos Space Management Platform. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos Space versions prior to 20.3R1.
- **CVE-2021-3141**: In Unisys Stealth (core) before 6.0.025.0, the Keycloak password is stored in a recoverable format that might be accessible by a local attacker, who could gain access to the Management Server and change the Stealth configuration.
- **CVE-2021-35050**: User credentials stored in a recoverable format within Fidelis Network and Deception CommandPost. In the event that an attacker gains access to the CommandPost, these values could be decoded and used to login to the application. The vulnerability is present in Fidelis Network and Deception versions prior to 9.3.3. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 9.3.3 and subsequent versions.
- **CVE-2021-37187**: An issue was discovered on Digi TransPort devices through 2021-07-21. An authenticated attacker may read a password file (with reversible passwords) from the device, which allows decoding of other users' passwords.

- **CVE-2021-46440**: Storing passwords in a recoverable format in the DOCUMENTATION plugin component of Strapi before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5 allows an attacker to access a victim's HTTP request, get the victim's cookie, perform a base64 decode on the victim's cookie, and obtain a cleartext password, leading to getting API documentation for further API attacks.
- **CVE-2022-43460**: Driver Distributor v2.2.3.1 and earlier contains a vulnerability where passwords are stored in a recoverable format. If an attacker obtains a configuration file of Driver Distributor, the encrypted administrator's credentials may be decrypted.
- **CVE-2022-46142**: Affected devices store the CLI user passwords encrypted in flash memory. Attackers with physical access to the device could retrieve the file and decrypt the CLI user passwords.
- **CVE-2022-32519**: A CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format vulnerability exists that could result in unwanted access to a DCE instance when performed over a network by a malicious third-party. Affected Products: Data Center Expert (Versions prior to V7.9.0)


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-522
PeerOf -> CWE-259

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use strong, non-reversible encryption to protect stored passwords.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The meaning of this entry needs to be investigated more closely, especially with respect to what is meant by "recoverable."



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries
