- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and Retriever Results)



## Known Examples for CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30018](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30018): A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0220**: The Junos Space Network Management Platform has been found to store shared secrets in a recoverable format that can be exposed through the UI. An attacker who is able to execute arbitrary code in the victim browser (for example via XSS) or access cached contents may be able to obtain a copy of credentials managed by Junos Space. The impact of a successful attack includes, but is not limited to, obtaining access to other servers connected to the Junos Space Management Platform. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos Space versions prior to 20.3R1.
- **CVE-2021-3141**: In Unisys Stealth (core) before 6.0.025.0, the Keycloak password is stored in a recoverable format that might be accessible by a local attacker, who could gain access to the Management Server and change the Stealth configuration.
- **CVE-2021-35050**: User credentials stored in a recoverable format within Fidelis Network and Deception CommandPost. In the event that an attacker gains access to the CommandPost, these values could be decoded and used to login to the application. The vulnerability is present in Fidelis Network and Deception versions prior to 9.3.3. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 9.3.3 and subsequent versions.
- **CVE-2021-37187**: An issue was discovered on Digi TransPort devices through 2021-07-21. An authenticated attacker may read a password file (with reversible passwords) from the device, which allows decoding of other users' passwords.
- **CVE-2021-45892**: An issue was discovered in Softwarebuero Zauner ARC 4.2.0.4. There is storage of Passwords in a Recoverable Format.
- **CVE-2021-46440**: Storing passwords in a recoverable format in the DOCUMENTATION plugin component of Strapi before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5 allows an attacker to access a victim's HTTP request, get the victim's cookie, perform a base64 decode on the victim's cookie, and obtain a cleartext password, leading to getting API documentation for further API attacks.
- **CVE-2022-43460**: Driver Distributor v2.2.3.1 and earlier contains a vulnerability where passwords are stored in a recoverable format. If an attacker obtains a configuration file of Driver Distributor, the encrypted administrator's credentials may be decrypted.
- **CVE-2022-46142**: Affected devices store the CLI user passwords encrypted in flash memory. Attackers with physical access to the device could retrieve the file and decrypt the CLI user passwords.
- **CVE-2022-32519**: A CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format vulnerability exists that could result in unwanted access to a DCE instance when performed over a network by a malicious third-party. Affected Products: Data Center Expert (Versions prior to V7.9.0)
