# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-3622

## Query
A flaw was found in the hivex library. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted Windows Registry (hive) file, which would cause hivex to recursively call the _get_children() function, leading to a stack overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: recursive function call
- **weakness**: stack overflow
