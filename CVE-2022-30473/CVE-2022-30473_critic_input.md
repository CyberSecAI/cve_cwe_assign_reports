## Vulnerability Description
Tenda AC Series Router AC18_V15.03.05.19(6318) has a **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability in function form_fast_setting_wifi_set

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Tenda AC Series Router
- **version:** AC18_V15.03.05.19(6318)
- **component:** function form_fast_setting_wifi_set

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability present in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function of the Tenda AC18 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The code reads user-provided input for the `ssid` parameter into a buffer (`src`) and then copies this data to a smaller stack-based buffer (`s`) using `strcpy` without performing any length check. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `ssid` parameter is longer than the buffer `s`, overwriting other data on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing an overly long string for the `ssid` parameter, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow and cause the router to crash. This effectively leads to a DoS attack, disrupting the router's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` page of the router. The malicious payload is sent within the `ssid` parameter.
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the router. This could be either local access or remote access if the router's administration interface is exposed to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have the ability to send HTTP requests to the router.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Knowledge of how to send HTTP GET requests is required.
- **No Authentication Required (Inferred):** The document does not mention any authentication being required for this specific attack vector. This suggests that the vulnerability is accessible to anyone who can reach the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint.
- **Vulnerable Router Model:** The attacker needs a Tenda AC18 router running the vulnerable firmware version.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the latest version of the Tenda AC18 Router, specifically [AC18\_V15.03.05.19(6318)](https://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-2683.html).
- A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script is provided in Python, which demonstrates how to send a malicious request to cause the DoS.
- The issue was reported to both CVE and CNVD, and CVE-2022-30473 and CNVD-2022-43197 were assigned respectively.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" in the function `form_fast_setting_wifi_set`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further details that the code copies user-provided input for the `ssid` parameter into a smaller stack-based buffer using `strcpy` without a length check. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). While CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) is a broader category, the specific mention of "stack-based" makes CWE-121 a more precise fit. The use of `strcpy` without checking the size of the input is a classic example of how stack-based buffer overflows occur. CWE-121 is a Variant level CWE, making it an appropriate level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 allows its use.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. While it doesn't have direct relationships listed in the provided information, it is implicitly related to other buffer overflow CWEs like CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input). This relationship reinforces the selection of a buffer overflow CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of stack-based buffer overflow and supporting details in CVE Reference Links Content Summary).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
A buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the "classic" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.

### Alternative Terms
Classic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions "buffer overflow" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for "Buffer Copy" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no "Checking [the] Size of Input", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.
**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.

**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called "buffer overflows" are substantively different than the "classic" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument
- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable
- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a ">" but does not decrement for "<"



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
