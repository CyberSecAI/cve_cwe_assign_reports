## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**use after free**" as the **rootcause** which directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The description also mentions "**heap corruption**" as a weakness, which is a typical consequence of a use-after-free vulnerability, where freed memory is accessed again, potentially leading to memory corruption. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by explicitly mentioning "Use after free" as the root cause. CWE-416 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction, and its description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's details. The MITRE mapping guidance allows using CWE-416.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 (Use After Free) has relationships with other CWEs, often resulting from other weaknesses or leading to other issues. However, in this case, the primary weakness is the Use After Free itself.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The description explicitly mentions "use after free", and the CVE summary confirms it).
