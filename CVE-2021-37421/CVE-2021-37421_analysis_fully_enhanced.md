| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-348 | Use of Less Trusted Source | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves bypassing admin portal access restrictions in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus by manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header. The application trusts this header to determine the source IP address for access control, which an attacker can easily spoof. This aligns precisely with CWE-425, which describes a web application that doesn't adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs or files. The **lack of proper input validation** on the IP address provided in the `X-Forwarded-For` header directly contributes to this weakness. CWE-425 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-425 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-425 is a Base level weakness. There are no direct relationships that impact the selection of this CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence based on the CVE reference link content summary and the retriever results.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The application trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` header, a less trusted source, to make authorization decisions. This maps to CWE-348 (Use of Less Trusted Source). The vulnerability description states that the application is vulnerable because it relies on the `X-Forwarded-For` header, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-348 is a Base level weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence because CWE-425 more directly addresses the authorization bypass, whereas CWE-348 describes the use of a less trusted source which is a contributing factor)



## Known Examples for CWE-348: Use of Less Trusted Source
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0860** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0860](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0860): Product uses IP address provided by a client, instead of obtaining it from the packet headers, allowing easier spoofing.
- **CVE-2004-1950** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1950](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1950): Web product uses the IP address in the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header instead of a server variable that uses the connecting IP address, allowing filter bypass.
- **CVE-2001-0908** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0908](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0908): Product logs IP address specified by the client instead of obtaining it from the packet headers, allowing information hiding.
- **CVE-2006-1126** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1126](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1126): PHP application uses IP address from X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, instead of REMOTE_ADDR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-37421**: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus 6103 and prior is vulnerable to admin portal access-restriction bypass.
