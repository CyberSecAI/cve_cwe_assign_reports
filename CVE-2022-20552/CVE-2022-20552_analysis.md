# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.60 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**use after free**" condition, leading to a potential "**out of bounds read**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the "**Root cause of vulnerability**" as "Heap use-after-free". This strongly aligns with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed. The "**weakness**" is described as an "**out of bounds read**" which matches CWE-125. However, since the root cause is Use-After-Free, CWE-416 is chosen as the primary, and CWE-125 as a secondary. The impact of the vulnerability, as described in the vulnerability description, is "local information disclosure".
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration or Release). CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) can often result from a Use-After-Free condition, as the freed memory might be reallocated and accessed incorrectly.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear description and confirmation from CVE reference).
