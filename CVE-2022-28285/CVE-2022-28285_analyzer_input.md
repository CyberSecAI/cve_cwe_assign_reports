## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect `AliasSet` being used during the generation of assembly code for `MLoadTypedArrayElementHole` in the JavaScript engine's JIT compiler. The `AliasSet` is used for memory access tracking and optimization. The incorrect `AliasSet` lacked the necessary information about `ArrayBufferViewLengthOrOffset` and `ObjectFields`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect AliasSet:** The `MLoadTypedArrayElementHole` instruction's `AliasSet` was set to `AliasSet::Load(AliasSet::UnboxedElement)` which did not account for the access to `ArrayBufferViewObject::dataOffset()` and the need for `AliasSet::ArrayBufferViewLengthOrOffset` and `AliasSet::ObjectFields`.
*   **Missing Memory Access Information:** Due to the incorrect `AliasSet`, the JIT compiler was not aware of the potential memory accesses related to the typed array's length or offset.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Out-of-bounds memory read:** The vulnerability, when combined with another unspecified vulnerability, could allow for out-of-bounds memory reads. The incorrect `AliasSet` could cause the JIT compiler to make incorrect assumptions about memory accesses during optimization. It could allow an attacker to bypass memory safety checks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JavaScript code execution:** The vulnerability is in the JavaScript engine, so the attack vector would involve executing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** The advisory and bug report explicitly mention this issue isn't exploitable on its own, but in combination with *another* vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker would need to be able to execute JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable browser or application.
*   **Knowledge of a second vulnerability:** The attacker would need to know about and leverage a secondary vulnerability to exploit this issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug was introduced by a change in [Bug 829896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=829896), which modified the AliasSet from `AliasSet::Store(AliasSet::Any)` to `AliasSet::Load(AliasSet::TypedArrayElement)`.
*   The vulnerability was rated as "moderate" severity.
*   The fix involves adding `AliasSet::ArrayBufferViewLengthOrOffset` and `AliasSet::ObjectFields` to the `MLoadTypedArrayElementHole`'s `AliasSet`.
*   The fix was included in Firefox 99, Firefox ESR 91.8, and Thunderbird 91.8.
