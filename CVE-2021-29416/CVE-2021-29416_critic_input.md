# Critic Input for CVE-2021-29416



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in PortSwigger Burp Suite before 2021.2. During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** leak NetNTLM hashes
- **vector:** malicious request
- **product:** PortSwigger Burp Suite
- **version:** before 2021.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a security fix in Burp Suite, specifically addressing a vulnerability related to upstream proxy configurations and potential NetNTLM hash leaks on Windows systems. This aligns with the provided CVE description that mentions a fix regarding upstream proxy configuration.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stemmed from Burp Suite not respecting its configured upstream proxy settings in certain scenarios.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability was a failure to consistently use the configured upstream proxy. This could lead to Burp Suite making direct network connections, bypassing the intended proxy.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** On Windows systems, this could lead to the leakage of NetNTLM hashes if a connection was made to a vulnerable SMB server. This is because the SMB protocol can be used to trigger authentication, and if the connection occurs without going through a proxy, the Windows system may send its NetNTLM hash over the network.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through network requests made by Burp Suite. By crafting malicious network traffic to trigger this issue in combination with a vulnerable SMB server, an attacker could potentially capture NetNTLM hashes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and analyze the network traffic or have control of an SMB server that can trigger an authentication request and be able to intercept the leaked hash. Also, the victim machine must be a Windows system that does not block outbound SMB traffic.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves Burp Suite not respecting its upstream proxy configuration, potentially leaking NetNTLM hashes. This can be viewed as a **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)** because the application fails to ensure that all outgoing requests, especially those that can expose sensitive information, are properly routed through the configured proxy. This proxy would act as a form of authentication or authorization enforcement, ensuring that requests are handled securely and according to policy. It can also be viewed as **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)** because the NetNTLM hash, which is sensitive data, is inadvertently sent to a potentially malicious SMB server due to the proxy bypass.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is a base-level weakness, which makes it a good fit. It is related to authentication bypass issues. CWE-201 involves sensitive data exposure. The retriever suggests both of these as potential weaknesses. CWE-306 can lead to CWE-201 in this scenario.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence, as the description focuses on the proxy bypass leading to data leakage, but the core issue is lack of enforced proxy usage.)

Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
- **CVE-2021-24170**: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.

Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Specify which data in the software should be regarded as sensitive. Consider which types of users should have access to which types of data.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that any possibly sensitive data specified in the requirements is verified with designers to ensure that it is either a calculated risk or mitigated elsewhere. Any information that is not necessary to the functionality should be removed in order to lower both the overhead and the possibility of security sensitive data being sent.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** System Configuration
- **Description:** Setup default error messages so that unexpected errors do not disclose sensitive information.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.
