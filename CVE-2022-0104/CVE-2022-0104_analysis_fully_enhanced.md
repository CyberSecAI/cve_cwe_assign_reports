| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Acceptable-Use |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a heap **buffer overflow** in ANGLE in Google Chrome. The key phrase "Heap **buffer overflow**" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states "Heap buffer overflow", strongly suggest CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and a specific type of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap. The description explicitly mentions the heap, making CWE-122 a more precise fit than its parent CWE-119 or the broader CWE-787. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-122 indicates that it is ALLOWED for heap overflow conditions, solidifying this mapping.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 and is related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The relationship analysis shows that CWE-122 is a specific instance of a more general out-of-bounds write, but the context focuses on the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "heap buffer overflow" in the vulnerability description and reference links, combined with the Variant abstraction level)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also considered because heap overflows are inherently out-of-bounds writes. However, since the description specifically mentions a heap **buffer overflow**, CWE-122 is a more precise classification. CWE-787 is a base level CWE, but CWE-122 gives more specific context to the location of the overflow.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a parent of CWE-122 and describes a general out-of-bounds write. While true, the focus is on a heap buffer, making CWE-122 the better choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Lower confidence because CWE-122 is more specific, although CWE-787 still represents the out-of-bounds write aspect of the vulnerability)



## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
