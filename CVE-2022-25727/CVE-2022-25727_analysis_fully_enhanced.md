| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**improper length check while copying into memory**" leading to "**memory corruption**". CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) aligns well with the **improper length check** aspect, as it focuses on the failure to validate the quantity (length) of input. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also relevant as the **improper length check** leads to writing data past the buffer's boundaries, causing **memory corruption**. While the description doesn't explicitly mention out-of-bounds write, it is a likely consequence of failing to validate the length. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) could also be a cause of the **memory corruption** because the buffer size may be incorrectly calculated.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and a parent of CWE-606 (Use of Client-side Input to Modify Critical Parameters). CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-131 is a parent of CWE-467 (Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type). The primary weakness is the input validation issue (CWE-1284), leading to the buffer overflow (CWE-787), and potentially related to the incorrect calculation of the buffer size (CWE-131).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (The vulnerability description clearly points to a **improper length check** as the root cause, but the consequence of out-of-bounds write is inferred and not explicitly stated. The retriever results also support this choice.)
