## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-26450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `apusys` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-362**: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition').
- The race condition leads to a use-after-free scenario, which is a memory corruption issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can result in local escalation of privilege (EoP). This means an attacker can gain higher privileges on the system than they initially had.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to be able to execute code on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs "System execution privileges" to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is not required.
- This means the attacker would likely need to already have some level of access to the system, though not necessarily root access to begin with.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- MT6879
- MT6895
- MT6983

**Affected Software Versions:**
- Android 12.0

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in `apusys` involves a race condition that leads to a use-after-free, potentially granting an attacker with some level of system access a privilege escalation to higher permissions.
