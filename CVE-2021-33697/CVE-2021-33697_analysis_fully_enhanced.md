# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-33697

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-601 | URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1022 | Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that an unauthenticated attacker can **redirect users to a malicious site**. This aligns well with CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')). CWE-601 describes a scenario where a web application accepts user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and uses that link in a redirect. The fact that the attacker is unauthenticated strengthens the case for CWE-601, as there is no access control preventing the redirection. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-601 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED. CWE-1022 (Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access) is also a possibility, but it involves the `window.opener` object, which is not explicitly mentioned in the description. Thus, CWE-601 is the primary weakness.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships for CWE-601 provided in the context. CWE-601 is a Base level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High match with the vulnerability description and the CWE definition. The description focuses on the redirection aspect which is core to CWE-601.

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1022 (Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with `window.opener` Access) is a secondary candidate. While the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention the `window.opener` object, the Reverse Tabnabbing vulnerability type can involve it. Reverse Tabnabbing exploits the `window.opener` relationship between pages, allowing a malicious page to modify the original page's location. Given that this is a possibility, CWE-1022 is considered. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1022 indicates its usage is ALLOWED and is at the Variant level of abstraction.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships for CWE-1022 provided in the context. CWE-1022 is a Variant level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Possible, but less direct evidence compared to CWE-601. The reliance on reverse tabnabbing requiring the `window.opener` makes it less confident.)



## Known Examples for CWE-1022: Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-4927** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4927](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4927): Library software does not use rel: "noopener noreferrer" setting, allowing tabnabbing attacks to redirect to a malicious page
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-33697**: Under certain conditions, SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (SAPUI5), versions - 420, 430, can allow an unauthenticated attacker to redirect users to a malicious site due to Reverse Tabnabbing vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2022-4927**: A vulnerability was found in ualbertalib NEOSDiscovery 1.0.70 and classified as problematic. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file app/views/bookmarks/_refworks.html.erb. The manipulation leads to use of web link to untrusted target with window.opener access. The attack may be initiated remotely. Upgrading to version 1.0.71 is able to address this issue. The patch is named abe9f57123e0c278ae190cd7402a623d66c51375. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-222287.
- **CVE-2022-30610**: IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management 2.2.0.0 through 2.2.15.0 is vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing where it could allow a page linked to from within IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management to rewrite it. An administrator could enter a link to a malicious URL that another administrator could then click. Once clicked, that malicious URL could then rewrite the original page with a phishing page. IBM X-Force ID: 227363.
