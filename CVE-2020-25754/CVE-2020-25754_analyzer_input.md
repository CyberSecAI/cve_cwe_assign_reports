# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-25754

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **weak password**
- **attacker:** unauthenticated user
- **product:** Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2020-25754:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided text discusses vulnerabilities in Enphase Envoy solar power controllers, and it explicitly mentions CVE-2020-25755. While it does not discuss CVE-2020-25754 directly, the described weaknesses and vulnerabilities are likely related to that CVE. This is based on the information provided in the content, which details a series of vulnerabilities discovered in the Enphase Envoy controller. 

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary issue is the use of a custom PAM authentication module (`pam_emu.so`) that relies on hardcoded passwords derived from the device's serial number and usernames (e.g., "installer," "root," "pebuser," "enphase"). These passwords are predictable and easily calculated.
   - **Command Injection:** The `/installer/upgrade_start` function allows for command injection via the `force` query parameter.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Predictable Passwords:** Passwords for various user accounts (including root) are generated by a simple MD5 hash of a known string, including the device's serial number, and the username making them predictable.
   - **Authentication Bypass:**  The custom PAM module bypasses the standard Linux user authentication mechanism, rendering the `/etc/shadow` file ineffective.
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The system is vulnerable to command injection through the web interface, allowing remote code execution.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Full System Control:** Attackers can gain root access to the Enphase Envoy controller via SSH.
   - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify system data, including energy production statistics.
   - **False SREC generation**: Attackers can generate false solar renewable energy certificates by manipulating the data sent to the SREC program.
   - **Potential Botnet Inclusion**: The compromised devices could become part of botnets.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they can access the device on the local network or remotely if the device is exposed to the Internet.
   - **Web Interface:** The command injection vulnerability is exploitable via the web interface.
   - **SSH:** Once the hardcoded credentials are known, the attacker can gain remote shell access via SSH.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Enphase Envoy device's network interface.
    - **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a moderate level of technical knowledge to understand the device, its software, and how to generate the passwords.
    - **Serial number of the device:** The serial number of the targeted device is necessary to generate the passwords.
    - **Ability to access and modify the SPI flash:** In order to be able to gain the initial console access and dump the firmware, the attacker needs to be able to connect to the SPI flash chip and modify it.

**Additional Details:**
   - The attacker reverse-engineered the installer application to extract the password generation method and the S3 bucket containing the firmware.
   - The attacker exploited the U-boot bootloader to gain access to the device's storage and retrieve the firmware.
   - The attacker found the `pam_emu.so` module and reverse engineered it to understand how authentication was being performed.

While the content does not discuss CVE-2020-25754 directly it provides significant detail about related vulnerabilities discovered and exploited in Enphase Envoy controllers.
