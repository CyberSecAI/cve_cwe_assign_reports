# Critic Input for CVE-2020-25754



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **weak password**
- **attacker:** unauthenticated user
- **product:** Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2020-25754:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided text discusses vulnerabilities in Enphase Envoy solar power controllers, and it explicitly mentions CVE-2020-25755. While it does not discuss CVE-2020-25754 directly, the described weaknesses and vulnerabilities are likely related to that CVE. This is based on the information provided in the content, which details a series of vulnerabilities discovered in the Enphase Envoy controller. 

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary issue is the use of a custom PAM authentication module (`pam_emu.so`) that relies on hardcoded passwords derived from the device's serial number and usernames (e.g., "installer," "root," "pebuser," "enphase"). These passwords are predictable and easily calculated.
   - **Command Injection:** The `/installer/upgrade_start` function allows for command injection via the `force` query parameter.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Predictable Passwords:** Passwords for various user accounts (including root) are generated by a simple MD5 hash of a known string, including the device's serial number, and the username making them predictable.
   - **Authentication Bypass:**  The custom PAM module bypasses the standard Linux user authentication mechanism, rendering the `/etc/shadow` file ineffective.
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The system is vulnerable to command injection through the web interface, allowing remote code execution.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Full System Control:** Attackers can gain root access to the Enphase Envoy controller via SSH.
   - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify system data, including energy production statistics.
   - **False SREC generation**: Attackers can generate false solar renewable energy certificates by manipulating the data sent to the SREC program.
   - **Potential Botnet Inclusion**: The compromised devices could become part of botnets.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they can access the device on the local network or remotely if the device is exposed to the Internet.
   - **Web Interface:** The command injection vulnerability is exploitable via the web interface.
   - **SSH:** Once the hardcoded credentials are known, the attacker can gain remote shell access via SSH.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Enphase Envoy device's network interface.
    - **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a moderate level of technical knowledge to understand the device, its software, and how to generate the passwords.
    - **Serial number of the device:** The serial number of the targeted device is necessary to generate the passwords.
    - **Ability to access and modify the SPI flash:** In order to be able to gain the initial console access and dump the firmware, the attacker needs to be able to connect to the SPI flash chip and modify it.

**Additional Details:**
   - The attacker reverse-engineered the installer application to extract the password generation method and the S3 bucket containing the firmware.
   - The attacker exploited the U-boot bootloader to gain access to the device's storage and retrieve the firmware.
   - The attacker found the `pam_emu.so` module and reverse engineered it to understand how authentication was being performed.

While the content does not discuss CVE-2020-25754 directly it provides significant detail about related vulnerabilities discovered and exploited in Enphase Envoy controllers.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the Enphase Envoy devices use a custom PAM module for user authentication that relies on a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number, which can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user. This directly corresponds to **CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)** since the password generation mechanism is predictable and easily calculated. The fact that the serial number is accessible without authentication makes the **weakness** exploitable. Given that the passwords used for authentication are derived from a known process, and the input to the process is easily accessible, this makes the password itself **hard-coded** in practice, and that's why CWE-259 is a strong candidate. This aligns with the 'Acceptable-Use' Rationale in the MITRE Mapping Guidance, as CWE-259 is at the Variant level of abstraction. I am selecting CWE-259 as the primary weakness because the PAM module is specifically using **hardcoded passwords** derived from a known algorithm.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-259 is a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), meaning CWE-259 is more specific. CWE-259 is PEEROF CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match in the vulnerability description to the CWE definition, retriever results, and mapping guidance).

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)** is a broader category that encompasses the use of hardcoded passwords, cryptographic keys, or other credentials. While CWE-259 is more specific in this case, CWE-798 still applies because the **root cause** involves the use of **hardcoded credentials** within the custom PAM module. The use of a password derived from the serial number and username falls under the definition of hardcoded credentials, as these values are not dynamically generated or securely managed. I am selecting this as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability involves the use of **hardcoded credentials** in the PAM module. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-798 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-798 is a parent of CWE-259. The relationship analysis suggests that CWE-798 is a more general category, with CWE-259 being a specific instance of using **hardcoded passwords**.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence as the vulnerability description clearly indicates the use of **hardcoded credentials**.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* **CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort)** applies because the passwords are derived from an MD5 hash, which is considered a **weak** hashing algorithm. The vulnerability description mentions that the password is derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. MD5 is known to be susceptible to collision attacks and is not considered a secure hashing algorithm for password storage. Therefore, using it to generate passwords constitutes using a hashing scheme with insufficient computational effort. Although the MD5 hash is not directly the password, it is an intermediate step to derive the password. This makes CWE-916 a good candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships found for CWE-916.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (The vulnerability description indicates the use of MD5, which is known to be a **weak** hashing algorithm, aligning with CWE-916.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.

ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-344
ChildOf -> CWE-671
PeerOf -> CWE-257
ParentOf -> CWE-259
ParentOf -> CWE-321

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access



## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10.

- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

### Extended Description


Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.


Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.


There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:


  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash ("stretching")

  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash ("memory-hard" operations)

  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation ("salting")

  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs ("one-way" hashing)

  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs ("collision resistance")

Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** 

Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.


Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.


Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Architecture and Design
- **Description:** When using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are often essential for preventing common attacks.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1526:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2006-1058:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2008-4905:** Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.
