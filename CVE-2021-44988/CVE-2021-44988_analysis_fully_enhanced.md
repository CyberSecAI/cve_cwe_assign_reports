# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.75 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** in Jerryscript v3.0.0 and below, specifically within `ecma_find_named_property` in `ecma-helpers.c`. This directly corresponds to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant-level CWE that describes a buffer overflow occurring on the stack. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause involves a recursive call triggered by a crafted JavaScript payload, which further supports the selection of CWE-121. The summary states a "lack of stack overflow checks" which directly contributes to this weakness. The `Array.prototype.flat` is the vector used. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as a candidate, although not the top-ranked one, but the direct mention of a stack overflow makes it the most appropriate choice.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), providing a more specific classification for this vulnerability. Given the information provided, it isn't clear that a buffer is copied without checking the size, so CWE-120 is less applicable. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is more general, and CWE-121 provides better specificity. CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is a Class-level CWE that could contribute to the stack overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of stack overflow and confirmation from CVE reference materials)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The recursive nature of the vulnerability, as highlighted in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary ("The vulnerability in `ecma_find_named_property` is triggered by a recursive call"), makes CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) a relevant, although secondary, consideration. While the primary issue is the stack overflow itself (CWE-121), the lack of control over the recursion depth directly contributes to the overflow. Therefore, CWE-674 captures an important aspect of the root cause. As a Class-level CWE, it's less specific than CWE-121 but still relevant in understanding the overall vulnerability. The retriever results also lists CWE-674 as a candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children that could be more appropriate, but none of them perfectly fit the description. It describes the condition that allows the stack overflow to occur.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence because while recursion is a contributing factor, the core vulnerability is the stack overflow.)
