# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.85 | Variant | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **out of bounds write** due to a **heap buffer overflow**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause involves unsafe usage of `sprintf`, `snprintf`, `scnprintf` and `strcpy` functions when writing to a buffer within the sysfs interface, without proper length checks, leading to a buffer overflow. This aligns directly with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which describes writing data past the end or before the beginning of an intended buffer. CWE-787 is a base level CWE and is ALLOWED. The **heap buffer overflow** reinforces the likelihood of CWE-787."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and has child CWEs such as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). Given the context of the heap, CWE-122 is a closely related and potentially co-occurring weakness, but CWE-787 more precisely describes the **out of bounds write**."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of the **out of bounds write** and confirming details in CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary both mention a **heap buffer overflow** as the root cause. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of a buffer overflow that occurs specifically in the heap portion of memory. Since the vulnerability is explicitly described as a **heap buffer overflow**, CWE-122 is a relevant secondary weakness. CWE-122 is a variant level CWE and is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-122 is a specific type of buffer overflow, and it is a parent of CWE-787. The relationship strengthens the case for considering CWE-122 as a contributing factor."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of the **heap buffer overflow** and confirming details in CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
