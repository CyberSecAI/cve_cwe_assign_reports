# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-32623

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-703 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 0.6 | Pillar | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**out of bounds write** due to **incorrect error handling**". CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses the **weakness** of writing data beyond the intended buffer. CWE-703 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is related to the **root cause** of the vulnerability which is **incorrect error handling**. The `mdp` component's failure to adequately handle errors leads to the out-of-bounds write condition. While CWE-703 is listed as a potential weakness, it's a high-level Pillar and less specific than CWE-787, which describes the direct coding error. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports the root cause and weakness, which is **incorrect error handling** leads to the out-of-bounds write.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a Base level CWE that accurately describes the **weakness**. CWE-703 is a high-level Pillar and is less specific.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "out of bounds write" and supporting CVE references.)

## Known Examples for CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
### Observed Examples
- **[REF-1374]** [https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards): Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)
- **CVE-2022-22224** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22224](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22224): Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-20637**: Improper check or handling of exceptional conditions in LOGITEC LAN-W300N/PR5B allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending a specially crafted URL.
- **CVE-2021-20642**: Improper check or handling of exceptional conditions in LOGITEC LAN-W300N/RS allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending a specially crafted URL.
- **CVE-2021-41580**: The passport-oauth2 package before 1.6.1 for Node.js mishandles the error condition of failure to obtain an access token. This is exploitable in certain use cases where an OAuth identity provider uses an HTTP 200 status code for authentication-failure error reports, and an application grants authorization upon simply receiving the access token (i.e., does not try to use the token). NOTE: the passport-oauth2 vendor does not consider this a passport-oauth2 vulnerability
- **CVE-2021-38608**: Incorrect Access Control in Tranquil WAPT Enterprise - before 1.8.2.7373 and before 2.0.0.9450 allows guest OS users to escalate privileges via WAPT Agent.
- **CVE-2021-35465**: Certain Arm products before 2021-08-23 do not properly consider the effect of exceptions on a VLLDM instruction. A Non-secure handler may have read or write access to part of a Secure context. This affects Arm Cortex-M33 r0p0 through r1p0, Arm Cortex-M35P r0, Arm Cortex-M55 r0p0 through r1p0, and Arm China STAR-MC1 (in the STAR SE configuration).
- **CVE-2020-1639**: When an attacker sends a specific crafted Ethernet Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (Ethernet OAM) packet to a target device, it may improperly handle the incoming malformed data and fail to sanitize this incoming data resulting in an overflow condition. This overflow condition in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by coring the CFM daemon. Continued receipt of these packets may cause an extended Denial of Service condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S15; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D95 on SRX Series; 14.1X50 versions prior to 14.1X50-D145; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D47; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R2; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D170 on SRX Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D67.
- **CVE-2020-5622**: Shadankun Server Security Type (excluding normal blocking method types) Ver.1.5.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service which may result in not being able to add newly detected attack source IP addresses as blocking targets for about 10 minutes via a specially crafted request.
- **CVE-2021-25365**: An improper exception control in softsimd prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged applications to access the API in softsimd.
