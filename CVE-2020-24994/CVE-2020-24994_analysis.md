# Analysis for CVE-2020-24994

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | The vulnerability is specifically a stack overflow in the `parse_tag` function due to deeply nested tags leading to excessive recursion. |
| CWE-674 | Improper Control of Recursion | 0.75 | Class | Secondary | The excessive recursion in `parse_tag` leading to the stack overflow indicates an improper control of recursion. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** in the `parse_tag` function, making CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) the most appropriate primary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by explaining that deeply nested tags in the `\t()` tags are the cause of this vulnerability as they lead to excessive recursion. The vulnerability is caused due to improper handling of nested tags in the `parse_tags` function. The root cause is the excessive recursion. CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion) is included as a secondary CWE because the stack overflow is a direct result of uncontrolled recursion. The description aligns strongly with the characteristics of CWE-121 as the overflow occurs on the stack and is triggered by a crafted input. The evidence provides specific technical details, increasing confidence in this mapping."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and it's related because the **stack overflow** is a consequence of the product's inability to properly control the depth of recursion. CWE-121 and CWE-674 are related in that uncontrolled recursion can lead to a stack overflow when each recursive call consumes stack memory without proper bounds checking."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to direct mention of stack overflow and supporting details about the recursive cause)
