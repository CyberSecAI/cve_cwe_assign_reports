# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-40987

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the (ddns1|ddns2) username WORD password CODE command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates where the size of command parameters is not checked against the size of the stack buffer before being passed to sprintf, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the command parsing functionality of the `DetranCLI` binary.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities, leading to full control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted network packets containing commands with overly long parameters sent to the vulnerable service (DetranCLI).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device, and have knowledge of the vulnerable commands and the format of the network packets.",
   "Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs within the `sprintf` function where parameters, particularly those derived from user input, are copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper size validation. The `DetranCLI` binary defines several command templates with different parameters. These parameters are parsed and used in `sprintf` calls. The content includes detailed command templates and the vulnerable sprintf calls for each identified CVE.  The vulnerable `sprintf` calls use format strings and `argv` parameters passed as arguments to the command. `argv` is an array of strings populated based on the input. The size of `argv` parameters is not checked against the size of `stack_buffer`."
