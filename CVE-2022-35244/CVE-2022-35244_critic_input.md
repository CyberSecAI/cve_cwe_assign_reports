### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **format string injection**
- **impact:** memory corruption and information disclosure and denial of service
- **vector:** malicious XML payload
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Abode Systems iota All-In-One Security Kit
- **version:** 6.9X and 6.9Z
- **component:** XCMD getVarHA functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `getVarHA` XCMD handler in the Abode iota All-In-One Security Kit uses an attacker-controlled string (HA variable name set via `setVarHA` XCMD) as the format string in `xvsprintfcat`. This function is used within `xml_construct_response` to build an XML response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Format string injection vulnerability (CWE-134).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Memory corruption: By crafting a specific format string, an attacker can overwrite memory.
    - Information disclosure: Stack data can be leaked by using format string specifiers like `%x`.
    - Denial of service (DoS): Using the `%n` specifier, an attacker can attempt to write to invalid memory addresses, causing a segmentation fault and crashing the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a malicious XML payload containing the `setVarHA` XCMD with a crafted variable name, followed by a `getVarHA` XCMD to trigger the format string vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send XCMDs to the device, which can be done via UDP/55050 without authentication. The attacker must also know the MAC address of the target device, which is transmitted in the XCMD.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**format string injection**" vulnerability exists. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section explicitly mentions that the `getVarHA` XCMD handler uses an attacker-controlled string as the format string in `xvsprintfcat`, leading to a format string injection vulnerability (CWE-134). The impact described (memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service) aligns perfectly with the typical consequences of CWE-134. The CWE-134 description states: "The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source," which accurately reflects the vulnerability. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-134 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships are apparent that affect the mapping decision. While CWE-134 is related to improper input validation, the specific nature of the format string injection makes CWE-134 the most appropriate and specific choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32785**: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

### Extended Description


When an attacker can modify an externally-controlled format string, this can lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or data representation problems.


It should be noted that in some circumstances, such as internationalization, the set of format strings is externally controlled by design. If the source of these format strings is trusted (e.g. only contained in library files that are only modifiable by the system administrator), then the external control might not itself pose a vulnerability.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668
CanPrecede -> CWE-123
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Choose a language that is not subject to this flaw.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that all format string functions are passed a static string which cannot be controlled by the user, and that the proper number of arguments are always sent to that function as well. If at all possible, use functions that do not support the %n operator in format strings. [REF-116] [REF-117]

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Build and Compilation
- **Description:** Run compilers and linkers with high warning levels, since they may detect incorrect usage.



### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

This weakness is possible in any programming language that support format strings.


**[Other]** 

While Format String vulnerabilities typically fall under the Buffer Overflow category, technically they are not overflowed buffers. The Format String vulnerability is fairly new (circa 1999) and stems from the fact that there is no realistic way for a function that takes a variable number of arguments to determine just how many arguments were passed in. The most common functions that take a variable number of arguments, including C-runtime functions, are the printf() family of calls. The Format String problem appears in a number of ways. A *printf() call without a format specifier is dangerous and can be exploited. For example, printf(input); is exploitable, while printf(y, input); is not exploitable in that context. The result of the first call, used incorrectly, allows for an attacker to be able to peek at stack memory since the input string will be used as the format specifier. The attacker can stuff the input string with format specifiers and begin reading stack values, since the remaining parameters will be pulled from the stack. Worst case, this improper use may give away enough control to allow an arbitrary value (or values in the case of an exploit program) to be written into the memory of the running program.


Frequently targeted entities are file names, process names, identifiers.


Format string problems are a classic C/C++ issue that are now rare due to the ease of discovery. One main reason format string vulnerabilities can be exploited is due to the %n operator. The %n operator will write the number of characters, which have been printed by the format string therefore far, to the memory pointed to by its argument. Through skilled creation of a format string, a malicious user may use values on the stack to create a write-what-where condition. Once this is achieved, they can execute arbitrary code. Other operators can be used as well; for example, a %9999s operator could also trigger a buffer overflow, or when used in file-formatting functions like fprintf, it can generate a much larger output than intended.


**[Research Gap]** Format string issues are under-studied for languages other than C. Memory or disk consumption, control flow or variable alteration, and data corruption may result from format string exploitation in applications written in other languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, etc.
