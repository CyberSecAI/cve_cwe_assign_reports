# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-0434

## Vulnerability Description
In onReceive of BluetoothPermissionRequest.java, there is a possible phishing attack allowing a malicious Bluetooth device to acquire permissions based on **insufficient information presented to the user in the consent dialog**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-10 Android-11 Android-9Android ID A-167403112

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0434:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from an unclear warning message presented to users when pairing with Bluetooth devices, potentially leading to phishing attacks. The vulnerability is related to the user interface of the Settings app when dealing with Bluetooth pairing requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient User Prompts:** The primary weakness is that the initial warning message displayed during Bluetooth pairing is not clear enough for users to avoid phishing attacks.
- **Lack of Clarity:** The prompts do not adequately inform the user about the potential risks of pairing with untrusted devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks over Bluetooth.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By tricking users into pairing with malicious devices, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's device or data.
- **User Deception:** Users may be deceived into thinking a malicious device is legitimate due to the unclear warning messages.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Bluetooth Pairing:** The attack vector is primarily through Bluetooth pairing requests.
- **Malicious Device:** An attacker would need to control a malicious Bluetooth device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device.
- **Bluetooth Device Control:** The attacker needs the capability to broadcast Bluetooth pairing requests using a malicious device.
- **Timing:** The attacker must initiate a pairing request to coincide with a time when the user may be susceptible to deception.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code changes indicate that the fix involves adding more prompts to clarify the risks during Bluetooth pairing.
- The fix is part of the Android Settings app.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 9, 10, and 11.
- The vulnerability is categorized as an "Elevation of Privilege" (EoP).
