# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3611

## Vulnerability Description
A **stack overflow** vulnerability was found in the Intel HD Audio device (intel-hda) of QEMU. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw affects QEMU versions prior to 7.0.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **impact:** crash the QEMU process
- **attacker:** malicious guest
- **product:** QEMU
- **version:** prior to 7.0.0
- **component:** Intel HD Audio device (intel-hda)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-3611:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a reentrancy problem within the QEMU's Intel HD Audio (intel-hda) device emulation. Specifically, the Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine was allowed to access the HDA controller's I/O registers, which are memory mapped I/O (MMIO) regions. This could lead to the DMA engine re-entering the MMIO handler, which is not designed to be re-entrant.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **DMA to MMIO:** The primary vulnerability is the ability of the DMA engine to target MMIO regions of the HDA controller.
- **Reentrancy Issues:** The HDA controller's MMIO handlers were not designed to handle being re-entered through DMA, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can cause a stack overflow and crash the QEMU process on the host, leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability can lead to a guest-initiated crash of the QEMU process.
- **Guest Sandbox Escape:** While not explicitly stated in all sources, the Gentoo security advisory mentions the potential for "remote code execution (guest sandbox escape)" which is more impactful than just denial of service.
- **System availability:** The Red Hat bugzilla entry notes that the highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Guest:** A malicious guest operating system within the QEMU virtual machine can trigger the vulnerability. This attack vector is from within the guest, not from the host.
- **DMA Operations:** The attack involves manipulating the HDA device's DMA engine through specific commands sent from the guest to cause it to access the controller's MMIO registers in a way that triggers the reentrancy and stack overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system running within QEMU.
- **HDA Device Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with and send commands to the emulated intel-hda device.
- **Ability to Trigger DMA:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the intel-hda device to trigger the vulnerable DMA operation.
- **No other special privileges are needed**, as it is a normal operation for a guest to interact with a hardware device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in QEMU upstream version 5.0.0.
- The fix restricts the DMA engine to accessing memory regions only, preventing access to MMIO devices like the HDA controller.
- The provided reproducer code demonstrates the steps to trigger the stack overflow.
- The issue is related to a broader class of "DMA reentrancy" problems in QEMU.
