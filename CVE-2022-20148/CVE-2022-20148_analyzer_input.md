## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20148:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the f2fs (Flash-Friendly File System) discard mechanism. The default discard policy, `DPOLICY_BG`, uses an I/O aware background thread, which can be blocked from issuing discard commands. When dealing with low RAM situations, cached discard commands may consume large amounts of memory, creating memory pressure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory exhaustion:**  The caching of discard commands in f2fs can lead to high memory consumption on low RAM devices, potentially causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Inefficient discard processing:** The `DPOLICY_BG` thread may not be able to issue discard commands effectively in low RAM scenarios.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A device with limited memory may become unresponsive or crash due to memory exhaustion caused by the cached discard commands.
*   **Reduced performance:**  The system may experience overall slowdowns due to excessive memory pressure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Normal File System Operations:** An attacker doesn't need direct access to the file system. Normal file system operations that lead to generating discard commands will cause the vulnerability to be triggered if the system has low memory.
*   **Low Memory Conditions:** The vulnerability is exacerbated when the system is under memory pressure, making it more likely that a large amount of discard commands is cached.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to cause discard commands**: An attacker only needs to perform file system operations that generate discard requests. No root or elevated privileges is required.
*   **Low RAM conditions:** For the vulnerability to be triggered, low memory conditions need to be present.

**Mitigation:**

The fix involves allowing the discard policy to be changed to `DPOLICY_FORCE` based on the configured `nm_i->ram_thresh`. This allows discard commands to be issued more aggressively in low-memory situations, reducing memory pressure.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided commit messages are all identical, which implies that the fix involves changing the discard policy under certain conditions.
*   The commit message explicitly mentions "low RAM setups".
*   The fix is related to the Linux Kernel f2fs implementation.
*   The security bulletin for Pixel devices confirms the vulnerability as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) issue within the Kernel component.
*   The severity is rated as Moderate in the security bulletin.
