# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-11279 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Root cause of memory corruption due to **improper length check** |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary, as a potential consequence of the incorrect buffer size calculation. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary, as a potential consequence of the incorrect buffer size calculation. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**Memory corruption** while processing crafted SDES packets due to **improper length check** in sdes packets". This clearly indicates an issue with how the length of the SDES packets is being handled, leading to memory corruption. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) directly addresses the root cause of "**improper length check**" that leads to **memory corruption**. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-131 having a high combined score. It is a base level CWE and the Usage is Allowed.
  CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are included as secondary CWEs because **improper length check** can lead to reading or writing beyond the allocated buffer, causing memory corruption.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-131 can lead to memory corruption, which is the high level symptom. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are potential impacts resulting from the incorrect buffer size calculation. CWE-131 is a child of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to clear description of **improper length check** leading to **memory corruption**, aligning well with CWE-131.
  - Confidence: 0.65 for CWE-125 and CWE-787 as secondary issues due to the possibility of reading or writing beyond buffer limits.
