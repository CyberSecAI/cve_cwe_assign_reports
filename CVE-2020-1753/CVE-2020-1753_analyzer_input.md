# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-1753

## Vulnerability Description
A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** disclose passwords and tokens
- **product:** Ansible Engine
- **version:** all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7
- **component:** k8s module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-1753:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ansible `kubectl` connection plugin passes sensitive parameters, such as passwords and tokens, directly on the command line to the `kubectl` tool. This exposes the sensitive information to process listings, logs and standard output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) is exposed by being passed as command-line arguments.
*   **Lack of Secure Handling:**  The `kubectl` plugin was not using environment variables or secure input files for sensitive parameters.
*   **Ineffective `no_log`:** The `no_log` directive in the debug module of Ansible was not preventing the exposure of secrets, as these were arguments to the external `kubectl` command.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive authentication credentials (passwords, tokens) through process listings, logs and standard output.
*   **Compromised Kubernetes Clusters:** Exposed credentials can potentially allow attackers to compromise the Kubernetes clusters managed via Ansible.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system where Ansible is running can view the process list, which can include the command-line arguments with the exposed credentials.
*   **Log Files:** Logs can inadvertently record the command line arguments, thereby exposing the secrets.
*  **Standard Output:**  If verbose mode is used, secrets may be written to the standard output.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local Access (low privilege):** An attacker would need local access to the system running the Ansible playbook.
*   **Knowledge of Ansible Playbook:**  Knowledge of how to deploy to kubernetes clusters through Ansible is required.
*   **Ability to View Process List and Logs:** Attackers need the ability to view the process list of running commands and access the log files to extract the exposed secrets.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Ansible versions 2.7.x before 2.7.18, 2.8.x before 2.8.12, and 2.9.x before 2.9.7.
*   The fix involves updating the `kubectl` connection plugin to avoid passing sensitive parameters as command-line arguments.
* The issue was addressed by changes in the `community.kubernetes` collection and backported into the Ansible core.
* The fix for this issue includes a warning on the usage of the `kubectl_extra_args` parameter which could expose sensitive data.

The provided documents contain information about the fix in the `ansible-collections/community.kubernetes` repository, as well as security advisories from Gentoo and Debian, and Red Hat bugzilla entries and mailing lists. These provide more detail than the original CVE description about the specific nature of the vulnerability and its remediation.
