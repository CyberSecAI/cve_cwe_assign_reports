# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-1753 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.85 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability lies in how Ansible passes sensitive parameters to `kubectl`. Instead of using secure methods like environment variables or input configuration files, it passes passwords and tokens directly on the command line. This makes the sensitive information visible in process listings. This aligns perfectly with CWE-214 [Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information], which describes a process being invoked with sensitive command-line arguments visible to other processes. Additionally, the vulnerability description and CVE summary specifically mention the exposure of credentials through the process list, reinforcing this mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-214 indicates this is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-214 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere]. While CWE-497 is a parent, CWE-214 is more specific to the vulnerability. CWE-214 is PEEROF itself."

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability also leads to sensitive information being written to log files. The `no_log` directive in Ansible's debug module is ineffective in preventing this because the sensitive parameters are passed to `kubectl` as command-line arguments. This aligns with CWE-532 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File], which describes a product writing sensitive information to a log file. The CVE summary explicitly mentions the disclosure of secrets in log files. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-532 indicates this is ALLOWED."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-532 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]. While CWE-200 is a parent, CWE-532 is more specific to the vulnerability."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence for CWE-214: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
  - Confidence for CWE-532: 0.85 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
