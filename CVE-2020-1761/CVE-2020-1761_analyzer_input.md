# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-1761

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in the OpenShift web console, where the access token is stored in the browsers local storage. An attacker can use this flaw to get the access token via physical access, or an XSS attack on the victims browser. This flaw affects openshift/console versions before openshift/console-4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** get the access token
- **vector:** physical access or XSS attack
- **product:** openshift/console
- **version:** before openshift/console-4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-1761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The OpenShift web console stores access tokens in the browser's local storage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insecure Storage:** Storing access tokens in browser local storage makes them accessible to malicious scripts running within the browser and attackers with physical access to the machine.
-   **XSS Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is exploitable if an XSS vulnerability exists in the web console.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Access Token Theft:** Attackers can steal access tokens.
-   **Account Compromise:** Stolen access tokens can be used to impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to the OpenShift platform.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to a user's computer can potentially extract the access token from local storage.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an XSS vulnerability exists in the OpenShift web console, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code to steal the access token from local storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Physical Access:** Requires physical access to the user's machine to access local storage directly.
-   **XSS Exploitation:** Requires the ability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser session accessing the OpenShift web console.
