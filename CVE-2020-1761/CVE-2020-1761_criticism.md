# Criticism for CVE-2020-1761

Okay, I've reviewed the analysis and the complete CWE specifications. Here's my critique:

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally sound and well-reasoned. The primary CWE selection of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is appropriate. The secondary CWEs, CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), are also relevant in the context of the vulnerability. The confidence scores assigned to each CWE seem justified based on the provided evidence.

**Detailed Critique:**

*   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials (Primary CWE):**

    *   **Strengths:** The explanation is clear and accurate.  The justification for why CWE-522 is the primary concern is well-articulated: storing the access token in local storage constitutes an instance of insufficiently protected credentials because the credential is accessible to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Mapping Guidance Review:** The analysis correctly notes that CWE-522 is a Class CWE and requires reviewing its children for a more specific fit. *This is important because the CWE specifications explicitly say "Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit".* It's good that the analysis mentions this review was performed.
    *   **Potential Alternatives Within CWE-522's Children:** The primary area for potential improvement lies in exploring the child CWEs of CWE-522 to determine if a more specific CWE is applicable. Let's examine some possibilities:
        *   **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password:** This could be a potential candidate *if* the local storage is indeed unencrypted (which is generally the case, making it effectively plaintext). However, while the token may not be *literally* a password, it *functions* as one. The analysis should explicitly consider and reject or accept this possibility with clear reasoning.
        *   **CWE-260: Password in Configuration File:** While local storage isn't a "configuration file" in the traditional sense, it *is* a persistent storage location.  The key question is whether the local storage mechanism is considered a "configuration file" for the purpose of this CWE.
        *   **CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials:** This isn't the primary issue, since the token is *at rest* in local storage. However, the transport from the application to local storage (and potentially *from* local storage when used) *could* be a concern if not protected. However, in this context, it is understood to be XSS, so CWE-79 is a better fit.

    *   **Mitigation Review:**  The analysis is missing a crucial step: *considering the potential mitigations of CWE-522*. This would further strengthen the argument for its selection. Mitigations include:
        *   Using appropriate security mechanisms to protect credentials.
        *   Using cryptography to protect the credentials (e.g., encrypting the token before storing it).

*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (Secondary Candidate):**

    *   **Strengths:** The explanation correctly links the risk of cleartext transmission to the often-unencrypted nature of local storage. The potential for "sniffing" is interpreted in a broader sense, not just network sniffing but access to the local storage data.
    *   **Weaknesses:**The connection to this CWE depends on the details of how the token is *used* after being retrieved from localStorage. This is less of a primary concern than the fact that it's stored there insecurely in the first place.
    *   **Mitigation Review:** The analysis is missing a crucial step: *considering the potential mitigations of CWE-319*. This would further strengthen the argument for its selection. Mitigations include:
        *   Encrypting the data using reliable, confidentiality-protecting cryptographic protocols.
        *   Ensuring SSL is used for the entire session from login to logout.

*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (Secondary Candidate):**

    *   **Strengths:** The analysis correctly identifies that the XSS attack vector is a major concern. The explanation accurately describes how XSS could be used to steal the token from local storage.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  The connection to this CWE is contingent on the *presence* of an XSS vulnerability. If there is no XSS vulnerability, CWE-79 is not applicable.
    *   **Mitigation Review:** The analysis is missing a crucial step: *considering the potential mitigations of CWE-79*. This would further strengthen the argument for its selection. Mitigations include:
        *   Using a vetted library or framework that prevents XSS.
        *   Understanding the context in which data will be used and using appropriate encoding.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Explicitly Consider CWE-522's Children:**  In the analysis for CWE-522, explicitly discuss the relevant child CWEs (especially CWE-256 and CWE-260), explaining why they are *not* a better fit, or arguing why one *is* a better fit. Provide specific reasoning.
2.  **Discuss Mitigations for *Each* CWE:** For each selected CWE (primary and secondary), include a brief discussion of potential mitigations as defined in the CWE specification.  This will further demonstrate the relevance of the selected CWEs.
3.  **Clarify Cleartext Transmission Context:** For CWE-319, clarify the context of "transmission." Is it just referring to the potential for network sniffing of the localStorage file, or other pathways of cleartext transfer of this token?

| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                              | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials                                 | 0.90       | Class                  | Allowed-with-Review                   | Primary CWE.  Considered children, especially CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage) and CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File), but determined that CWE-522 is the most appropriate class due to the token's function as a credential, and because the storage location functions as persistent storage. Mitigations include using encryption and secure storage mechanisms. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information                         | 0.75       | Base                  | Allowed                            | Secondary Candidate. Relevant because local storage is often unencrypted. This is applicable even if the initial transfer to local storage is encrypted, as the data is at rest in a vulnerable state.                                                              |
| CWE-79  | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('XSS') | 0.65       | Base                  | Allowed                            | Secondary Candidate. Only applicable *if* an XSS vulnerability exists. If present, XSS can be used to steal the access token from local storage. Mitigations for XSS are crucial to preventing this attack vector.                                          |

By incorporating these suggestions, the analysis will become more robust and demonstrate a more thorough understanding of the CWE specifications and their application to the vulnerability.
