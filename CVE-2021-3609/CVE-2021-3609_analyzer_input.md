# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3609

## Vulnerability Description
.A flaw was found in the CAN BCM networking protocol in the Linux kernel, where a local attacker can abuse a flaw in the CAN subsystem to corrupt memory, crash the system or escalate privileges. This **race condition** in net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel allows for local privilege escalation to root.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **impact:** local privilege escalation to root
- **attacker:** local attacker
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** net/can/bcm.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `net/can/bcm.c` file of the Linux kernel.
*   This race condition occurs between the `bcm_release()` and `bcm_rx_handler()` functions.
*   Specifically, while `bcm_rx_handler()` is processing an incoming CAN message for a socket, the `bcm_release()` function can be called simultaneously (e.g., when the socket is closed). `bcm_release()` frees the `struct bcm_sock` and `struct bcm_op` which are still in use by `bcm_rx_handler()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:**  The core vulnerability is a use-after-free. Because `bcm_release()` can free memory while `bcm_rx_handler()` is still executing, `bcm_rx_handler()` ends up accessing freed memory.
*   **Race Condition:** The race condition between `bcm_release()` and `bcm_rx_handler()` makes exploitation possible by creating the timing window needed for the use-after-free to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a local privilege escalation to root. This is because the use-after-free can be leveraged to overwrite sensitive data in memory which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information due to the ability to read freed memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause a system crash by corrupting memory if exploitation does not go as planned.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning an attacker must have some level of access to the vulnerable system.
*   **CAN BCM Sockets:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of CAN BCM (Controller Area Network Broadcast Manager) sockets. Specifically by creating a listener on a socket, sending it a CAN message and simultaneously closing the receiving socket to trigger the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The vulnerability can be exploited from an unprivileged user namespace.
*   **Network Interface Setup:** The attacker needs to setup a virtual CAN (vcan) network interface.
*   **CAN BCM Socket Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create and manipulate CAN BCM sockets, send CAN messages and close sockets.
*   **Precise Timing:** Exploitation relies on a race condition, requiring precise timing to free the memory at a specific point while the handler is executing.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 2.6.25 up to 5.13-rc6.
*   A fix was introduced in kernel commit `d5f9023fa61ee8b94f37a93f08e94b136cf1e463`.
*   The fix involves adding a `synchronize_rcu()` call before freeing the `bcm_op` to prevent use-after-free. This guarantees that any RCU read-side critical sections are finished before freeing the memory.

**Affected Products (from NetApp advisory):**

*   NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H300E/H500E/H700E/H410S
