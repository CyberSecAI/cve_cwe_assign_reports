## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in Mojo" which is a direct match for CWE-416 (Use After Free). The description also mentions "**heap corruption**", which is a common consequence of use-after-free vulnerabilities. The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by highlighting the "**use-after-free** in Mojo" as the root cause. CWE-416 is a Variant level weakness, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates that it is ALLOWED. The retriever results confirms that CWE-416 is the best match with a score of 0.8872, so I'm selecting it as the primary CWE.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). Exploiting a use-after-free can lead to other weaknesses, such as CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) or CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), but these are impacts and not the root cause.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match based on vulnerability description, CVE reference summary, and retriever results)
