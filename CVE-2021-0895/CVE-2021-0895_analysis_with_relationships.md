# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-0895 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an "**out of bounds write**" due to a "**missing bounds check**." This directly corresponds to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which occurs when a product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The "missing bounds check" is the root cause that allows the out-of-bounds write to occur. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this root cause and the presence of the out-of-bounds write. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions also supports CWE-787. CWE-125 is a possible secondary CWE due to the potential for reading data out of bounds, however, the description focuses on writing out of bounds.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) but is more specific. CWE-787 can lead to CWE-269 (Privilege Management) as noted in previous analysis, due to the potential for privilege escalation mentioned in the vulnerability description.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description, root cause analysis, and reference materials.)
