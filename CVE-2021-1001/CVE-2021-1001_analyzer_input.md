## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1001:

**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `mpeg4enc` component, specifically in the resolution check. The encoder was not properly limited, allowing for resolutions beyond 2048x2048.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is a lack of sufficient validation on the input resolution provided to the MPEG4 encoder. This allowed for the possibility of supplying excessively large resolutions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The provided text indicates that CVE-2021-1001 is classified as an "ID" (Information Disclosure) vulnerability. Although the specific details of what information could be disclosed aren't detailed here, it's reasonable to assume that an attacker, by manipulating the resolution parameters, could potentially trigger a condition leading to the exposure of memory contents or internal state of the encoder or related system components, which might include sensitive information.
- **Note:**  The impact is listed as "Moderate" severity in the security bulletin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing an MPEG4 encoder with a manipulated input stream that contains resolution parameters exceeding 2048x2048. The exact method of how this stream reaches the vulnerable encoder instance (e.g., through a crafted media file, through specific API calls, etc.) is not specified within this provided context, but it involves getting the vulnerable encoder to process the manipulated stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to provide or manipulate the input to the vulnerable MPEG4 encoder. This might involve controlling the media stream being processed by an application, through specific API calls, or by using a crafted media file. The attacker likely needs some ability to get their specially crafted stream to be processed by the affected device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message indicates that the fix limits the encoder to a maximum resolution of 2048x2048, thus mitigating the vulnerability.
- The CVE is included in the Pixel Update Bulletinâ€”December 2021 and addressed by security patches.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.
- The provided information confirms this vulnerability is present in AOSP version 12.
