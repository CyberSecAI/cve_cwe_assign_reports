# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-550 | Server-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability involves a server generating an error message that inadvertently includes sensitive information, specifically the client username and IP address. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-550, 'Server-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information'. The vulnerability description clearly states that a server-generated error message is the **root cause** and that this message contains sensitive information. The **impact** is that a malicious webserver can retrieve this information. The retriever results also highlight CWE-550 as the top candidate with a high score, supporting this choice. The CWE-550 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred and its usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-550 is a variant. It is related to CWE-209 ('Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information') as the generation of an error message is a prerequisite for this vulnerability. However, CWE-550 is more specific as it focuses on the error message containing *sensitive* information."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and retriever results)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-201 ('Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data') is a plausible secondary candidate. The core issue is that sensitive information (username and IP address) is being included in the server response (error message). While CWE-550 focuses on the server-generated error message aspect, CWE-201 highlights the fact that sensitive information is being sent. The retriever results list CWE-201 as the second highest candidate with high graph score. CWE-201 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred and its usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-201 is a base level CWE and is a child of CWE-200 ('Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor'). It can also be related to CWE-209 ('Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information'), where the error message is the vehicle for sending sensitive information."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate confidence as CWE-201 is related but less specific than CWE-550)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-209 ('Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information') is another plausible secondary candidate. While CWE-550 is more specific, CWE-209 captures the fact that an error message is being generated, which is a prerequisite for CWE-550. It is related as it describes the **root cause** is the server generating the error message itself. The retriever results show CWE-209 as a candidate, though with lower score. CWE-209 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred and its usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-209 is a base level CWE and is a child of CWE-200 ('Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor')."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Moderate confidence as CWE-209 is a prerequisite but less specific than CWE-550)
