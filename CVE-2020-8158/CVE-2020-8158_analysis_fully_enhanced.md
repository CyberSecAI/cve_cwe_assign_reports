# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-8158

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1321 | Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution') | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**prototype pollution** vulnerability" in the TypeORM package. This directly aligns with CWE-1321, "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')." CWE-1321 is a Variant-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to root causes. The description also mentions that this can lead to SQL injection attacks, suggesting a potential impact but not a direct root cause. CWE-89 is also listed as a potential impact of the **prototype pollution**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1321 is related to CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes), as both deal with uncontrolled modification of object attributes. CWE-915 is a parent of CWE-1321. However, since the description specifically mentions **prototype pollution**, CWE-1321 is a more precise match.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "prototype pollution," which directly maps to CWE-1321)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that the **prototype pollution** may lead to "SQL injection attacks." CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) is a base-level CWE that describes this weakness. While the primary weakness is **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321), the potential for SQL injection justifies considering CWE-89 as a secondary, impact-related CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-89 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). The prototype pollution could allow modification of data structures that are later used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence as it is a potential impact, not the root cause, and depends on how the polluted prototype is used.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-8158**: Prototype pollution vulnerability in the TypeORM package < 0.2.25 may allow attackers to add or modify Object properties leading to further denial of service or SQL injection attacks.
- **CVE-2021-43787**: Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
- **CVE-2020-7617**: ini-parser through 0.0.2 is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.The library could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype using a '__proto__' payload.
- **CVE-2020-7643**: paypal-adaptive through 0.4.2 manipulation of JavaScript objects resulting in Prototype Pollution. The PayPal function could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype using a __proto__ payload.
- **CVE-2020-7743**: The package mathjs before 7.5.1 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the deepExtend function that runs upon configuration updates.
- **CVE-2020-7771**: The package asciitable.js before 1.0.3 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the main function.
