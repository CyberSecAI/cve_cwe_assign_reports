# Analysis for CVE-2020-0481

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                        | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control                                         | 0.85       | Base                  | Allowed                         | Proper access control is needed |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization                                        | 0.65       | Class                  | Discouraged                      | Alternative mappings available    |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates a **permissions bypass**, allowing a non-system app to send a broadcast it should not have permission to send. The core issue is a failure to properly restrict access to a specific functionality, aligning with CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, highlighting "Improper access control or handling of Bluetooth device actions". CWE-284 is a base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-284 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). While authorization and access control are closely related, access control focuses on the mechanism used to enforce permissions, making CWE-284 a more precise fit.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
