# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-34720

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the IP Service Level Agreements (IP SLA) responder and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) features of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause device packet memory to become exhausted or cause the IP SLA process to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability exists because socket creation failures are mishandled during the IP SLA and TWAMP processes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IP SLA or TWAMP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the packet memory, which will impact other processes, such as routing protocols, or crash the IP SLA process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **mishandled socket creation failures**
- **impact:** exhaust the packet memory and crash the IP SLA process
- **vector:** specific IP SLA or TWAMP packets
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS XR Software
- **component:** IP Service Level Agreements (IP SLA) and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)

      "additional_information": "The advisory includes specific details on how to identify if a device is vulnerable using the `show running-config ipsla` command. It also notes that devices acting solely as initiators in IP SLA process are not affected unless the `responder` or `responder twamp` configurations are also enabled.\n\nMitigation is mentioned, but not as a workaround, that configuring the IP SLA responder with key-chain and a key-string password would require authentication to exploit. This would not address the underlying vulnerability.\n\nAlso, specific SMUs for various platforms and software versions are detailed."
