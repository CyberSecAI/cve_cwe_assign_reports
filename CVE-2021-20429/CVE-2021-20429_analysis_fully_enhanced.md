# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-20429

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-942 | Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability stems from an **overly permissive cross-domain policy**, allowing potentially malicious domains to access resources. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the root cause as an "**overly permissive cross-domain policy**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that "The User Behavior Analytics application add-on for IBM QRadar SIEM has an **overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy**." CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains) directly addresses this weakness, making it the most appropriate mapping. The retriever results also list CWE-942 as the top match.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-942 is a Variant of CWE-183 (Permissive List of Allowed Inputs) and CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints). While CWE-183 and CWE-923 are related, CWE-942 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability related to cross-domain policies.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-40128**: A vulnerability in the account activation feature of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send an account activation email with an activation link that points to an arbitrary domain. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the account activation page of Cisco Webex Meetings. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send to any recipient an account activation email that contains a tampered activation link, which could direct the user to an attacker-controlled website.
- **CVE-2021-21415**: Prisma VS Code a VSCode extension for Prisma schema files. This is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability that affects all versions of the Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0. If a custom binary path for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that sets a value for "prismaFmtBinPath". That custom binary is executed when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation checks are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in versions 2.20.0 and 20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file or check if the binary is malicious and delete it.
- **CVE-2021-23244**: ColorOS pregrant dangerous permissions to apps which are listed in a whitelist xml named default-grant-permissions.But some apps in whitelist is not installed, attacker can disguise app with the same package name to obtain dangerous permission.
- **CVE-2021-43415**: HashiCorp Nomad and Nomad Enterprise up to 1.0.13, 1.1.7, and 1.2.0, with the QEMU task driver enabled, allowed authenticated users with job submission capabilities to bypass the configured allowed image paths. Fixed in 1.0.14, 1.1.8, and 1.2.1.
- **CVE-2022-25237**: Bonita Web 2021.2 is affected by a authentication/authorization bypass vulnerability due to an overly broad exclude pattern used in the RestAPIAuthorizationFilter. By appending ;i18ntranslation or /../i18ntranslation/ to the end of a URL, users with no privileges can access privileged API endpoints. This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.
