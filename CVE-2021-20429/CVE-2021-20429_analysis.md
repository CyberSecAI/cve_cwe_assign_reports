# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-942 | Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability stems from an **overly permissive cross-domain policy**, allowing potentially malicious domains to access resources. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the root cause as an "**overly permissive cross-domain policy**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that "The User Behavior Analytics application add-on for IBM QRadar SIEM has an **overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy**." CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains) directly addresses this weakness, making it the most appropriate mapping. The retriever results also list CWE-942 as the top match.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-942 is a Variant of CWE-183 (Permissive List of Allowed Inputs) and CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints). While CWE-183 and CWE-923 are related, CWE-942 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability related to cross-domain policies.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results.)
