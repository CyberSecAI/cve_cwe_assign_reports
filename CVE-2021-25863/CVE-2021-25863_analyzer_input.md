# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-25863

## Vulnerability Description
Open5GS 2.1.3 listens on 0.0.0.03000 and has a **default password** of 1423 for the admin account.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **default password**
- **product:** Open5GS
- **version:** 2.1.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the default configuration of the `webui` component of Open5GS. Specifically:

1.  **Default Binding to 0.0.0.0:** The webui server, by default, binds to `0.0.0.0:3000`. This means that the control panel is accessible from any IP address, including the public internet (WAN), if the server is exposed without proper network restrictions.
2.  **Default Credentials:** If no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The combination of listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and a default, weak, hardcoded password creates a significant security risk.
*   **Exposure of Management Interface:** The webui control panel, intended for management, is exposed to potentially unauthorized users due to the default configuration.
*   **Reliance on Default Credentials:** The automatic creation of a default admin user with a well-known password allows for easy exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Takeover:** An attacker who can access the webui interface can log in using the default credentials and gain full administrative control of the Open5GS instance.
*   **Data Breach and Manipulation:** This could lead to unauthorized access to network configuration, data modification, and potentially denial of service.
*   **Compromise of Network:** Full control over the Open5GS instance could compromise the entire network it is managing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exposure:** The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can reach the exposed port 3000 of the Open5GS server. This could include:
    *   **Direct WAN Access:** If the server is directly connected to the internet without firewall or network address translation (NAT).
    *   **LAN Access:** If an attacker is present in the same local network as the vulnerable Open5GS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the webui interface on port 3000.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must be aware of the default username (`admin`) and password (`1423`). This information is available in the source code.

**Mitigation:**

The issue was mitigated with the following changes:

*   **Production mode:** In production mode, the server no longer creates the default admin/1423 account.
*   **WebUI Installation script:** The installation script now creates a default admin account if none exists during setup.
*   **Bind to localhost:** The webui was changed to use `localhost` by default.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the open5gs webui if the service was exposed to the internet, due to the default listening address and creation of a default admin user with a weak password.
