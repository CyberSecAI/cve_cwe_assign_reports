# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-25863

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1393 | Use of Default Password | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that Open5GS 2.1.3 uses a **default password** of "1423" for the admin account. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating, "**Default Credentials:** If no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423"". This aligns directly with CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password), which describes the use of default passwords for potentially critical functionality. The Retriever results also list CWE-1393 as the top candidate with a score of 0.5819, further supporting this classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1393 indicates that this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1393 is a child of CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) and is related to other authentication-related CWEs. While CWE-1392 is a parent class, CWE-1393 is more specific in that it directly involves a default *password*, making it a more appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence and supportive retriever results.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions that if no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423". This suggests that the system doesn't enforce proper authentication mechanisms by default, potentially leading to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While a **default password** is the primary issue, the automatic creation of the admin account without requiring an initial user setup points to a lack of enforced authentication. However, CWE-1393 is more directly applicable and specific.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is a parent of CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication). While CWE-306 is a base level CWE, the primary issue revolves around the presence of default credentials and not necessarily the absence of authentication mechanisms in every scenario. Therefore, while CWE-306 might be a contributing factor, it's not as central as CWE-1393.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence as the evidence supports the presence of a **default password** as the main issue.)



## Known Examples for CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-29779**: IBM QRadar SIEM 7.3 and 7.4 could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information due to the server performing key exchange without entity authentication on inter-host communications using man in the middle techniques. IBM X-Force ID: 203033.
- **CVE-2021-0133**: Key exchange without entity authentication in the Intel(R) Security Library before version 3.3 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via network access.
- **CVE-2021-38878**: IBM QRadar 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 could allow a malicious actor to impersonate an actor due to key exchange without entity authentication. IBM X-Force ID: 208756.
- **CVE-2022-39254**: matrix-nio is a Python Matrix client library, designed according to sans I/O principles. Prior to version 0.20, when a users requests a room key from their devices, the software correctly remember the request. Once they receive a forwarded room key, they accept it without checking who the room key came from. This allows homeservers to try to insert room keys of questionable validity, potentially mounting an impersonation attack. Version 0.20 fixes the issue.
