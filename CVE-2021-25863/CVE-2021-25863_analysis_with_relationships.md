# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-25863 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1393 | Use of Default Password | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that Open5GS 2.1.3 uses a **default password** of "1423" for the admin account. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating, "**Default Credentials:** If no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423"". This aligns directly with CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password), which describes the use of default passwords for potentially critical functionality. The Retriever results also list CWE-1393 as the top candidate with a score of 0.5819, further supporting this classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1393 indicates that this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1393 is a child of CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) and is related to other authentication-related CWEs. While CWE-1392 is a parent class, CWE-1393 is more specific in that it directly involves a default *password*, making it a more appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence and supportive retriever results.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions that if no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423". This suggests that the system doesn't enforce proper authentication mechanisms by default, potentially leading to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While a **default password** is the primary issue, the automatic creation of the admin account without requiring an initial user setup points to a lack of enforced authentication. However, CWE-1393 is more directly applicable and specific.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is a parent of CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication). While CWE-306 is a base level CWE, the primary issue revolves around the presence of default credentials and not necessarily the absence of authentication mechanisms in every scenario. Therefore, while CWE-306 might be a contributing factor, it's not as central as CWE-1393.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence as the evidence supports the presence of a **default password** as the main issue.)
