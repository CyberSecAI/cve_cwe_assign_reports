# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-35289

## Vulnerability Description
A **write-what-where** condition in hermes caused by an **integer overflow**, prior to commit 5b6255ae049fa4641791e47fad994e8e8c4da374 allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **weakness:** **write-what-where**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** crafted JavaScript
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Hermes
- **version:** prior to commit 5b6255ae049fa4641791e47fad994e8e8c4da374

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   A "write-what-where" condition exists in the Hermes JavaScript engine due to an integer overflow. This means an attacker can control the memory address to write to, and the data written.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Crafted JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within an application using a vulnerable version of the Hermes engine.
*  The application must permit the evaluation of untrusted JavaScript

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Hermes versions prior to commit `5b6255ae049fa4641791e47fad994e8e8c4da374`.
*   The provided text explicitly mentions that most React Native applications are not affected by this vulnerability, indicating that the vulnerability is only exploitable under specific circumstances where the application using the Hermes engine permits the evaluation of untrusted JavaScript.

The content from github.com provides the specific commit that addresses the issue, highlighting that the fix adds a guard against potential overflows. This is more technical detail than the CVE description and other provided content.
