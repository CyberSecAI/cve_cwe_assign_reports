# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2020-18220

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2020-18220

## Query
Weak Encoding for Password in DoraCMS v2.1.1 and earlier allows attackers to obtain sensitive information as it does not use a random salt or IV for its AES-CBC encryption, causes password encrypted for users to be susceptible to dictionary attacks.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: Weak Encoding for Password
- **weakness**: does not use a random salt or IV
