# Analysis for CVE-2020-18220

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-329 | Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. Predictable IV with CBC mode is a specific cryptographic weakness. |
| CWE-759 | Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Vulnerability description indicates the product does not use a random salt for its encryption. |
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates the application uses a static key for AES encryption. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states the weakness is a **"Weak Encoding for Password"** because it **"does not use a random salt or IV"**. The Retriever Results show that **CWE-329 (Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode)**, a Variant, has the highest score. This aligns with the vulnerability description because it describes the specific cryptographic weakness of using a predictable IV with CBC mode encryption. Given that the vulnerability description mentions the absence of a random IV, this is a strong match. The vulnerability also states it **"does not use a random salt"**. **CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt)** aligns with this. Additionally, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the application **"uses a static key (`doracms_`) for AES encryption"**, which is described by **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-329 is a Variant of CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)) and is related to CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values). CWE-759 is a Variant of CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). CWE-321 is a Variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and corroborating information from the CVE reference).
