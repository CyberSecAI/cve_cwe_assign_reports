# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21276

## Vulnerability Description
Polr is an open source URL shortener. in Polr before version 2.3.0, a vulnerability in the setup process allows attackers to gain admin access to site instances, even if they do not possess an existing account. This vulnerability exists regardless of users settings. If an attacker crafts a request with specific cookie headers to the /setup/finish endpoint, they may be able to obtain admin privileges on the instance. This is caused by a **loose comparison (==) in SetupController** that is susceptible to attack. The project has been patched to ensure that a strict comparison (===) is used to verify the setup key, and that /setup/finish verifies that no users table exists before performing any migrations or provisioning any new accounts. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. Users can patch this vulnerability without upgrading by adding abort(404) to the very first line of finishSetup in SetupController.php.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **loose comparison (==) in SetupController**
- **impact:** gain admin access
- **vector:** request with specific cookie headers to /setup/finish endpoint
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Polr
- **version:** before 2.3.0
- **component:** setup process

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `SetupController.php` file, specifically within the `finishSetup` function. The initial implementation used a loose comparison (`==`) to verify the setup key, which is vulnerable to type juggling. This allowed attackers to bypass the authorization check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Type Comparison:** Using `==` instead of `===` for comparing the setup authentication key allowed type juggling, enabling attackers to bypass the authorization check.
- **Missing Table Existence Check:**  The `finishSetup` function did not initially check if the `users` table existed before proceeding with setup. This allowed an attacker to re-run setup and create a new admin user, even if setup had been previously completed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could gain administrative access to Polr instances, even without existing accounts. This would enable them to control the application, including adding, modifying, or deleting user data, changing configurations, and potentially executing code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker must craft a malicious HTTP request with specific cookie headers to the `/setup/finish` endpoint. Specifically, they need to control the values of `setup_arguments` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Polr instance.
- **Knowledge of Setup Process:** The attacker needs knowledge of the Polr setup process and the structure of the `setup_arguments` cookie.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched by changing the loose comparison (`==`) to a strict comparison (`===`) in `SetupController.php`. Additionally, a check was added to ensure that the `users` table does not already exist before proceeding with database migrations or creating new accounts.
- A workaround was provided for users unable to upgrade: adding `abort(404)` at the beginning of the `finishSetup` function in `SetupController.php` would prevent the vulnerable code path from being executed.
- The affected versions are below 2.3.0, and the patched version is 2.3.0.
- The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-21276.
