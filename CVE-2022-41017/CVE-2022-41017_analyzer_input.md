# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41017

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the vpn basic protocol (l2tp|pptp) name WORD server WORD username WORD passsword WORD firmwall (on|off) defroute (on|off) localip A.B.C.D command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41017.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. The `sprintf` function is used to format strings into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking on the input parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `sprintf` function is used to copy data into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying the size of the input parameters, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and other critical data on the stack, which can be used to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network packets: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet containing a malicious command to the device.
- `DetranCLI` interface: The vulnerability is triggered through the customized router console by the `DetranCLI` binary, which accepts commands with vulnerable parsing patterns.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable command patterns is required.
- The attacker needs to have access to the `DetranCLI` interface.
- The CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs to have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Specific Details for CVE-2022-41017:**

- The specific vulnerable command for CVE-2022-41017 is: `vpn basic protocol (l2tp|pptp) name WORD server WORD username WORD passsword WORD firmwall (on|off) defroute (on|off) localip A.B.C.D`.
- The vulnerable code snippet for this command is:
```
sprintf(buff_0x100,"%d<%d<%s<%s<%s<%s<%d<%d<%s",1,based_on_argv[0],argv[1],argv[2],argv[3],argv[4],based_on_argv[5],based_on_argv[6],argv[7]);
```
- The `sprintf` function copies the parameters into `buff_0x100` without proper size checks, leading to a buffer overflow if the `WORD` arguments (argv[1], argv[2], argv[3], argv[4], and argv[7]) are too long.
