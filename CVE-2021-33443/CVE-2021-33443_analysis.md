|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack buffer overflow**" in `mjs_execute()` in `mjs.c`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause as "**stack buffer overflow** in the `mjs_execute()` function". CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE that accurately describes this vulnerability. It occurs when a buffer on the stack is overwritten, which aligns perfectly with the provided description. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-121 is ALLOWED for stack-based buffer overflows. While other buffer overflow CWEs exist (e.g., CWE-120, CWE-122), CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate given the explicit mention of the stack.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of the more general CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 could be used, CWE-121 provides a more precise classification by specifying that the overflow occurs on the stack. There are no relevant CanPrecede or CanFollow relationships to consider in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack buffer overflow" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary)
