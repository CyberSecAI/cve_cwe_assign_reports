# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-38384

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-393 | Return of Wrong Status Code | 0.85 | Base | Primary | The primary weakness is the incorrect return of a 403 status code when a 200 is expected. |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.60 | Class | Secondary | This CWE is related to the incorrect authorization due to the different status code. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.40 | Class | Secondary | This CWE is related to potentially exposing resources due to incorrect authorization |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in Serverless Offline returning an unexpected HTTP 403 status code for a route that should return 200, potentially leading developers to implement **incorrect access control**. The **root cause** is the serverless-offline plugin incorrectly handling routes with trailing slashes. This aligns with CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) because the plugin returns an incorrect status code which then causes developers to modify access controls. The CVE reference includes CWE-863, and while this is more general, it is related to the overall vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) is a Base level CWE and doesn't have explicit parent-child relationships to access control CWEs, it directly impacts the application's behavior. CWE-863 is a class-level weakness related to authorization that the CVE lists in the additional details.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct alignment with status code issue and supporting CVE information)

## Known Examples for CWE-393: Return of Wrong Status Code
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-1132** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1132](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1132): DNS server returns wrong response code for non-existent AAAA record, which effectively says that the domain is inaccessible.
- **CVE-2001-1509** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1509](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1509): Hardware-specific implementation of system call causes incorrect results from geteuid.
- **CVE-2001-1559** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1559](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1559): Chain: System call returns wrong value (CWE-393), leading to a resultant NULL dereference (CWE-476).
- **CVE-2014-1266** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1266](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1266): chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-38384**: Serverless Offline 8.0.0 returns a 403 HTTP status code for a route that has a trailing / character, which might cause a developer to implement incorrect access control, because the actual behavior within the Amazon AWS environment is a 200 HTTP status code (i.e., possibly greater than expected permissions).
- **CVE-2021-28971**: In intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8 on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled, aka CID-d88d05a9e0b6.


## Known Examples for CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-16247**: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.
- **CVE-2020-15824**: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.
- **CVE-2021-22118**: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.
- **CVE-2021-21334**: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.
