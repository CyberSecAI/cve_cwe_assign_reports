# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-38384 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-393 | Return of Wrong Status Code | 0.85 | Base | Primary | The primary weakness is the incorrect return of a 403 status code when a 200 is expected. |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.60 | Class | Secondary | This CWE is related to the incorrect authorization due to the different status code. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.40 | Class | Secondary | This CWE is related to potentially exposing resources due to incorrect authorization |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in Serverless Offline returning an unexpected HTTP 403 status code for a route that should return 200, potentially leading developers to implement **incorrect access control**. The **root cause** is the serverless-offline plugin incorrectly handling routes with trailing slashes. This aligns with CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) because the plugin returns an incorrect status code which then causes developers to modify access controls. The CVE reference includes CWE-863, and while this is more general, it is related to the overall vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) is a Base level CWE and doesn't have explicit parent-child relationships to access control CWEs, it directly impacts the application's behavior. CWE-863 is a class-level weakness related to authorization that the CVE lists in the additional details.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct alignment with status code issue and supporting CVE information)
