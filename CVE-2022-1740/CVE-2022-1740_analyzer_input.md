# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1740

## Vulnerability Description
The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast Xs on-screen application hash display feature, audit log export, and application export functionality rely on **self-attestation mechanisms**. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to disguise malicious applications on a device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **self-attestation mechanisms**
- **impact:** disguise malicious applications
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast Xs
- **version:** tested version
- **component:** on-screen application hash display feature and audit log export and application export functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-1740:

**Vulnerability:** Mutable Attestation or Measurement Reporting Data (CWE-1283)

**Root Cause:** The ImageCast X's on-screen application hash display, audit log export, and application export features rely on self-attestation mechanisms. This means the device is essentially vouching for its own integrity, and this information can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The system relies on self-attestation mechanisms for verifying application integrity, audit logs, and application exports. This means the device generates its own reports, without a trusted external authority verifying them.
*   The displayed application hash, audit logs, and application exports can be altered by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can disguise malicious applications installed on the device. By manipulating the displayed hash and exported audit logs, an attacker can make malicious software appear legitimate.
*   Compromised device reports would not reflect the presence of malicious code, making detection difficult.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Physical access to individual ImageCast X devices.
*   Modification of files before they are uploaded to ImageCast X devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Physical access to an ImageCast X device is required to manipulate the self-attestation mechanisms.
*   The attacker needs to be able to modify files that are to be uploaded to ImageCast X devices.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to tamper with the ImageCast X's self-generated reports (hashes, audit logs, and application exports), masking the presence of malicious software. This self-attestation mechanism is inherently insecure. The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can hide malicious applications by manipulating the device's integrity reporting features, making them difficult to detect through standard means.
