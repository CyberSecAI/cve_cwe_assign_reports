# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-33015

## Vulnerability Description
Cscape (All Versions prior to 9.90 SP5) lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files. This could lead to an **out-of-bounds write** via an **uninitialized pointer**. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized pointer**
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds write**
- **impact:** execute code
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Cscape
- **version:** All Versions prior to 9.90 SP5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2021-33015.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files in Horner Automation's Cscape software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The specific vulnerability is an "Access of Uninitialized Pointer" (CWE-824). This occurs due to the software's failure to properly handle user-supplied data within project files, potentially leading to the use of an uninitialized pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves using a specially crafted project file that exploits the vulnerable parsing logic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious project file to a user of the affected software. This is a local attack vector, so the attacker would need to have some form of access to the system to deliver the file. The vulnerability requires user interaction to open the malicious project file.
