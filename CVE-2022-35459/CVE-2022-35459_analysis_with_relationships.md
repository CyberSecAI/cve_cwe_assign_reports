```markdown
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.85 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Secondary | Allowed | Out-of-bounds write is a broader category that encompasses heap-based buffer overflows. |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Secondary | Allowed | CWE-119 is a parent of CWE-122 and CWE-787, representing a more general class of buffer-related errors. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap-buffer overflow**". CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) directly corresponds to this description. This is a variant-level CWE, offering a specific classification. The CVE description key phrases also includes "**heap-buffer overflow**" as the **weakness**.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and a more specific instance of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The retriever results also show CWE-122 as a candidate. While CWE-787 is listed as the Primary CWE Match based on similar CVE descriptions, the explicit mention of "heap" makes CWE-122 the more precise choice. CWE-119 represents the broader class of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence due to explicit mention of "heap-buffer overflow" in the vulnerability description.)
