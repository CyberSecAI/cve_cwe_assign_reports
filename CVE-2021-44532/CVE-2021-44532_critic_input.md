## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability stems from the **improper escape of SANs in string format**, leading to a **misinterpretation of input** during certificate validation. Node.js converts Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to a string format. This string format was vulnerable to injection when name constraints were used within a certificate chain. The **root cause** is the **improper handling of special characters in the SAN string**, which causes the system to misinterpret the input, thus aligning with CWE-115 (Misinterpretation of Input). This is supported by the CVE Reference Links which state that there is a string injection vulnerability in the way Node.js processes SANs when name constraints are used. CWE-115 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED for mapping."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "While the issue leads to a bypass of certificate name constraints (CWE-295), the underlying problem is how the input (SAN) is processed and misinterpreted. CWE-115 is a broader weakness that covers this **misinterpretation**. CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is considered because the fix involves escaping problematic characters in SANs, but the primary issue is the initial misinterpretation of the unescaped input. The graph relationships show no direct connections to CWE-115, but it can be related to weaknesses that involve processing external input without proper validation."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the clear description of the **misinterpretation** issue and the escaping fix.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability results in a bypass of name constraints during certificate verification, which directly relates to CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation). The CVE Reference Links explicitly mention a certificate verification bypass as an impact. This indicates that the certificate validation process is flawed, allowing potentially malicious certificates to be accepted. CWE-295 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED for mapping."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-295 is a consequence of the **misinterpretation** of the SAN data (CWE-115). The crafted certificate allows bypassing name constraints, a clear indication of validation failure. While CWE-295 is a valid result of the vulnerability, it is considered a secondary effect since the root cause lies in the improper handling of the input. There are no direct relationships of CWE-295. "

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (High confidence as the bypass is a direct consequence, but secondary to the **misinterpretation**.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The fix for the vulnerability involves escaping problematic characters in SANs, which relates to CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output). The **improper escape** of SANs in string format is mentioned in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases. The CVE Reference Links state the fix involves escaping problematic characters in SANs to prevent the injection. This demonstrates a failure to properly encode or escape the SAN data before it is used in the certificate validation process. CWE-116 is a Class level CWE and is ALLOWED-with-Review.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-116 is related to the **misinterpretation of the SAN data** and the certificate bypass. While the escaping fix is important, the primary issue is the initial **misinterpretation** of the unescaped input. "

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium confidence as the escaping issue is a contributing factor, but secondary to the **misinterpretation**.)

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using the ESAPI Encoding control [REF-45] or a similar tool, library, or framework. These will help the programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.


Alternately, use built-in functions, but consider using wrappers in case those functions are discovered to have a vulnerability.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Parameterization
- **Description:** 

If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.


For example, stored procedures can enforce database query structure and reduce the likelihood of SQL injection.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.
- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.
