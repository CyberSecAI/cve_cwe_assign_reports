# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-44532

## Vulnerability Description
Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format. It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.Versions of Node.js with the fix for this escape SANs containing the problematic characters in order to prevent the injection. This behavior can be reverted through the --security-revert command-line option.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper escape of SANs in string format**
- **impact:** bypass of name constraints
- **vector:** inject problematic characters
- **product:** Node.js
- **version:** < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44532:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Node.js converts Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to a string format for certificate validation. This string format was vulnerable to injection when name constraints were used within a certificate chain.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- String injection vulnerability in the way Node.js processes SANs when name constraints are used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows bypassing name constraints during certificate verification, potentially leading to a man-in-the-middle attack or the acceptance of malicious certificates.
- A certificate verification bypass

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a certificate with malicious SANs containing characters that could cause an injection when converted to a string. 
- The vulnerable process must perform certificate validation with name constraints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted certificate with specific SANs.
- They also would need to be positioned as a trusted endpoint to intercept or initiate a connection to the vulnerable system.
- No special attacker capabilities except the ability to craft a malicious certificate

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity.
- The fix involves escaping problematic characters in SANs to prevent the injection.
- A command-line option (`--security-revert`) can revert this behavior.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Node.js 12.x, 14.x, 16.x, and 17.x release lines.
- The vulnerability was reported by Google.
- Multiple NetApp products were potentially affected by this issue due to their incorporation of Node.js, but the advisory states that none of their listed products are affected.
- Debian also patched this vulnerability in their nodejs package.
