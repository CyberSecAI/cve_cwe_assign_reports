# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-39675

## Vulnerability Description
In GKI_getbuf of gki_buffer.cc, there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to a **heap buffer overflow**. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-12Android ID A-205729183

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **weakness:** **out of bounds write**
- **impact:** remote escalation of privilege
- **product:** Android
- **version:** Android-12
- **component:** GKI_getbuf of gki_buffer.cc

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a "tag-mismatch" within the `NFA_SendRawFrame` function in the NFC (Near Field Communication) component of the Android system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Tag Mismatch:** The core issue is a discrepancy in how tags are handled when sending raw NFC frames. This suggests a potential flaw in how data is processed, leading to an exploitable condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):**  The primary impact is the potential for an attacker to escalate their privileges on the device.
*   **Critical Severity:** The CVE description labels this a critical vulnerability, which is the most severe rating, meaning a successful exploit can have significant impact.
*   **Remote EoP:** A critical security vulnerability in the System component that could lead to remote escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **NFC Interaction:** The attack vector involves manipulating raw NFC frames sent through the `NFA_SendRawFrame` function.
*   **Remote:** Exploitation could potentially be achieved remotely, without requiring local access to the device

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft NFC Frames:** An attacker needs the capability to generate or modify raw NFC frames to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No Additional Execution Privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any prior elevated permissions on the device

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix is present in AOSP version 12.
*   The commit message mentions a "tag mismatch" in `NFA_SendRawFrame` and the fix was tested on Linux.

In summary, CVE-2021-39675 is a critical security vulnerability in the Android NFC component, caused by a tag mismatch, allowing for remote privilege escalation. An attacker would need to manipulate NFC frames to trigger the exploit.
