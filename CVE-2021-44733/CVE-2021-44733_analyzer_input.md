# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-44733

## Vulnerability Description
A **use-after-free** exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a **race condition** in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory object.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a race condition in the Linux kernel's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) subsystem related to the lifetime management of shared memory (`tee_shm`) objects. The driver uses a combination of an IDR (ID Allocator) to track these objects and reference counting via the dma-buf subsystem, which proves insufficient to prevent use-after-free scenarios.

Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the following:

1.  **Insufficient Reference Counting:** The TEE subsystem did not maintain a strong reference to its idle shared memory buffers. It relies on the dma-buf reference count, which is managed by user space file descriptor operations.
2.  **Race Condition during Teardown:** When a shared memory dma-buf file descriptor is closed, the `tee_shm` object might be in the process of being deallocated. This teardown path can be blocked by the `teedev` mutex, but the reference to the `tee_shm` object in the IDR might still be valid for a brief period.
3.  **Flawed Lookup Logic:** `tee_shm_get_from_id()` looks up a `tee_shm` object using the IDR and increments the dma-buf reference count *after* the lookup. This is problematic since the `tee_shm` object and its underlying memory might be in the process of being freed by another thread closing the dma-buf file descriptor. Thus, the lookup can return a pointer to a `tee_shm` that is in the process of deallocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. A `tee_shm` object can be accessed after it has been freed by the dma-buf subsystem because the lookup function can return a pointer to an object in the process of deallocation.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between a thread closing a shared memory file descriptor and another thread trying to access the same shared memory.
*   **Lack of Proper Synchronization:** The IDR and dma-buf reference counting mechanisms do not properly synchronize the lifecycle of `tee_shm` objects with their usage in the TEE subsystem. The mutex on `teedev->idr` is insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this UAF can cause the kernel to crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can overwrite a function pointer, which can lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel space, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The UAF leads to memory corruption when a freed object is accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system.
*   **Multi-threaded Application:** The exploit requires a multi-threaded application that uses the TEE driver.
*   **TEE Device Access:** The attacker must have permission to access a TEE device (typically `/dev/tee[0-9]`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **TEE Access:** The attacker must have the ability to open a TEE device and interact with the TEE driver.
*   **Shared Memory Allocation:** The attacker should be able to allocate shared memory via the TEE driver.
*   **Multi-threading:** The attacker needs to create a multi-threaded program to trigger the race condition. Specifically, one thread needs to be able to close the file descriptor associated with the shared memory while another thread attempts to open a session referencing the shared memory.
*   **Precise Timing:** The attacker might require precise timing to reliably trigger the race condition and achieve the UAF and potentially do heap spraying to control the freed memory.

**Additional Notes from the Analysis:**

*   **Patching Strategy:** The fix for this vulnerability involves direct reference counting on the `tee_shm` struct itself, and it replaces the dma-buf usage with `anon_inode_getfd()`. This separates the lifecycle of the underlying file from the `tee_shm` object, preventing the race condition.
*   **Exploitation Complexity:** While the vulnerability is present, exploitation is not trivial due to the race condition, time window, and need for heap manipulation and spraying to reallocate the freed object in controlled memory location and overwrite a function pointer.
*   **PAN Mitigation:** The provided exploit requires `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN` to be disabled because it needs to set a function pointer in kernel memory, but further research into bypassing PAN using ret2dir or physmap spraying is open.
*   **Syzkaller Discovery:** The vulnerability was initially discovered using the syzkaller fuzzer.

In summary, CVE-2021-44733 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel TEE subsystem that is caused by insufficient synchronization and reference counting, leading to a race condition that can be exploited by a local user.
