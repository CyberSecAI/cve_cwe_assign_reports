**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Misconfigured Web Server:** The core issue is that a web server (like Apache) hosting InvoicePlane is not configured to prevent directory listing. Specifically, the server is not preventing direct access to directories.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties:** This is the specific CWE associated with this vulnerability.
*   **Unauthenticated Directory Listing:** The web server allows listing the contents of directories without requiring any authentication.
*   **Unauthenticated File Download:**  Users can directly download files located within the web server's directories without authentication.
*   **Lack of Proper Server-Side Protection:** The application attempted to use `.htaccess` files and authenticated URLs for downloads, but these mechanisms are ineffective if the server is not configured to enforce these rules, which is not the case in a default Apache setup.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can list directories and download sensitive files meant to be private, such as configuration files, database backups, or source code.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can use directory traversal techniques to access files outside the intended web root.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers send direct HTTP requests to the web server for specific directories.
*   **Directory Traversal Sequences:** Attackers may use "../" sequences in URLs to access files in parent directories.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is that the **misconfigured web server** allows files and directories to be accessible to external parties without authentication. This aligns directly with CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties). The vulnerability description explicitly states that an attacker can perform unauthenticated directory listing and file download. The CVE reference summary confirms this, highlighting that the core issue is a misconfigured web server not preventing directory listing. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-552 indicates this is ALLOWED. Although there's mention of directory traversal as an attack vector, the root cause is the accessibility of files without authorization due to misconfiguration.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) is related and identified by the retriever, it is a consequence of the primary weakness (CWE-552) rather than the root cause. The **directory traversal** mentioned is an attack vector enabled by the **misconfiguration** and the ability to access files without authentication.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)

- **CVE-2020-11469**: Zoom Client for Meetings through 4.6.8 on macOS copies runwithroot to a user-writable temporary directory during installation, which allows a local process (with the user's privileges) to obtain root access by replacing runwithroot.
- **CVE-2022-23508**: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in GitOps run could allow a local user or process to alter a Kubernetes cluster's resources. GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronizing files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. Its endpoint had no security controls to block unauthorized access, therefore allowing local users (and processes) on the same machine to see and alter the bucket content. By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could pick a workload of their choosing and inject it into the S3 bucket, which resulted in the successful deployment in the target cluster, without the need to provide any credentials to either the S3 bucket nor the target Kubernetes cluster. There are no known workarounds for this issue, please upgrade. This vulnerability has been fixed by commits 75268c4 and 966823b. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022. ### Workarounds There is no workaround for this vulnerability. ### References Disclosed by Paulo Gomes, Senior Software Engineer, Weaveworks. ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: - Open an issue in [Weave GitOps repository](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops) - Email us at [support@weave.works](mailto:support@weave.works)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

### Extended Description


Web servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a "root" directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.


In cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, System Configuration, Operation
- **Description:** When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to disable public access.




### Observed Examples

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

**Reasons:**

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.


Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.


Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes ".." sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). This includes:


  - realpath() in C

  - getCanonicalPath() in Java

  - GetFullPath() in ASP.NET

  - realpath() or abs_path() in Perl

  - realpath() in PHP





### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.
