# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-29024

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.75 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is that the **misconfigured web server** allows files and directories to be accessible to external parties without authentication. This aligns directly with CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties). The vulnerability description explicitly states that an attacker can perform unauthenticated directory listing and file download. The CVE reference summary confirms this, highlighting that the core issue is a misconfigured web server not preventing directory listing. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-552 indicates this is ALLOWED. Although there's mention of directory traversal as an attack vector, the root cause is the accessibility of files without authorization due to misconfiguration.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) is related and identified by the retriever, it is a consequence of the primary weakness (CWE-552) rather than the root cause. The **directory traversal** mentioned is an attack vector enabled by the **misconfiguration** and the ability to access files without authentication.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)

## Known Examples for CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1835** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1835](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1835): Data file under web root.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-29024**: In InvoicePlane 1.5.11 a misconfigured web server allows unauthenticated directory listing and file download. Allowing an attacker to directory traversal and download files suppose to be private without authentication.
- **CVE-2021-22015**: The vCenter Server contains multiple local privilege escalation vulnerabilities due to improper permissions of files and directories. An authenticated local user with non-administrative privilege may exploit these issues to elevate their privileges to root on vCenter Server Appliance.
- **CVE-2020-11469**: Zoom Client for Meetings through 4.6.8 on macOS copies runwithroot to a user-writable temporary directory during installation, which allows a local process (with the user's privileges) to obtain root access by replacing runwithroot.
- **CVE-2022-23508**: Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in GitOps run could allow a local user or process to alter a Kubernetes cluster's resources. GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronizing files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. Its endpoint had no security controls to block unauthorized access, therefore allowing local users (and processes) on the same machine to see and alter the bucket content. By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could pick a workload of their choosing and inject it into the S3 bucket, which resulted in the successful deployment in the target cluster, without the need to provide any credentials to either the S3 bucket nor the target Kubernetes cluster. There are no known workarounds for this issue, please upgrade. This vulnerability has been fixed by commits 75268c4 and 966823b. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022. ### Workarounds There is no workaround for this vulnerability. ### References Disclosed by Paulo Gomes, Senior Software Engineer, Weaveworks. ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: - Open an issue in [Weave GitOps repository](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops) - Email us at [support@weave.works](mailto:support@weave.works) 
- **CVE-2021-25004**: The SEUR Oficial WordPress plugin before 1.7.2 creates a PHP file with a random name when installed, even though it is used for support purposes, it allows to download any file from the web server without restriction after knowing the URL and a password than an administrator can see in the plugin settings page.
- **CVE-2022-23621**: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can read any file located in the XWiki WAR (for example xwiki.cfg and xwiki.properties) through XWiki#invokeServletAndReturnAsString as `$xwiki.invokeServletAndReturnAsString("/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg")`. This issue has been patched in XWiki versions 12.10.9, 13.4.3 and 13.7-rc-1. Users are advised to update. The only workaround is to limit SCRIPT right.
- **CVE-2022-2834**: The Helpful WordPress plugin before 4.5.26 puts the exported logs and feedbacks in a publicly accessible location and guessable names, which could allow attackers to download them and retrieve sensitive information such as IP, Names and Email Address depending on the plugin's settings
