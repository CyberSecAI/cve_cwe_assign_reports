# Critic Input for CVE-2021-21253



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub. OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 **hashes user passwords without a salt**, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in the voting system.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21253

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application was using a one-way hash (SHA-256) without a salt to store user passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of One-Way Hash without Salt (CWE-759):** The primary weakness was the absence of a salt when hashing passwords. This made the system vulnerable to dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, and other pre-computed hash techniques, increasing the likelihood of password compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to crack user passwords, leading to unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Compromise of the Voting System:**  With compromised accounts, an attacker could manipulate votes, alter system configurations or cause data loss within the online voting system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers could use pre-computed hash tables (rainbow tables) or dictionary attacks to match hashed passwords with potential plain-text passwords.
- **Pre-computed Hashes:** Due to the lack of a salt, the same password would always produce the same hash, making it easier to crack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to password hashes:** The attacker would need access to the database containing the stored password hashes of users.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in OnlineVotingSystem versions prior to 1.1.2.
- The fix (in version 1.1.2) includes adding a long, randomly generated salt to the password hashing function.
- The commit `0181cb0272857696c8eb3e44fcf6cb014ff90f09` demonstrates a change that appears to add a salt to the SHA-256 hashing, though not yet correctly implemented (see the switch between `String password = sha.getSHA(request.getParameter("pass"));` and  `String password = request.getParameter("pass");` in `AdminLoginController.java` and `VoterLoginController.java`).
- The commit `bd4e6bc` mentioned in the references is the actual fix of this issue.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the OnlineVotingSystem **hashes user passwords without a salt**. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-759, "Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt," which is a Variant level weakness and is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly identifies this as the root cause and refers to CWE-759. The absence of a salt makes the system vulnerable to dictionary attacks, increasing the risk of password compromise. While other CWEs like CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) are relevant, CWE-759 is more specific to the described **weakness**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-759 is a child of CWE-916. CWE-916 is a more general case of using weak password hashing, while CWE-759 specifies the use of one-way hashing without a salt. Mapping to CWE-759 is more specific and appropriate given the description.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, as well as the Retriever Results)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is a candidate because the use of a one-way hash function without a salt indicates insufficient computational effort to protect passwords. The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive. It's a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED. While not as specific as CWE-759, it is still relevant as a broader characterization of the **weakness**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-916 is a parent of CWE-759, meaning that CWE-759 is a more specific type of insufficient computational effort.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Medium confidence because, although relevant, it's less specific than CWE-759)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.

### Extended Description


This makes it easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables.


It should be noted that, despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions. See CWE-916 for more details.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-916

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** 

Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.


Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.


Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Description:** If a technique that requires extra computational effort can not be implemented, then for each password that is processed, generate a new random salt using a strong random number generator with unpredictable seeds. Add the salt to the plaintext password before hashing it. When storing the hash, also store the salt. Do not use the same salt for every password.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Architecture and Design
- **Description:** When using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are often essential for preventing common attacks.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

### Extended Description


Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.


Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.


There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:


  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash ("stretching")

  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash ("memory-hard" operations)

  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation ("salting")

  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs ("one-way" hashing)

  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs ("collision resistance")

Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.
