## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **race condition** leads to possible **memory corruption** in the vow driver. The CVE Reference Link Content Summary confirms this, identifying the issue as CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) and indicating that the **race condition** can lead to **memory corruption**. CWE-367 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever Results also list CWE-367 as the top candidate. The vulnerability involves checking the state of a resource before using it, but the state can change between the check and the use, which invalidates the results of the check - a hallmark of TOCTOU issues.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-367 doesn't have any direct relationships listed in the provided information. However, race conditions often lead to other memory corruption issues like use-after-free (CWE-416) or out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), since unsynchronized access can lead to unexpected states and data overwrites.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence because the CVE summary explicitly calls out CWE-367 and the vulnerability description aligns with the TOCTOU pattern)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-416 (Use After Free) is considered as a secondary candidate because the initial **memory corruption** caused by the **race condition** could potentially lead to a use-after-free scenario if a memory location is freed prematurely due to the timing issue and then subsequently accessed. While not explicitly stated, the **memory corruption** could manifest as a use-after-free. The Retriever Results list CWE-416 as a candidate, but its score is lower than CWE-367.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant and child of other weaknesses but none specifically stand out here. CWE-416 can be a consequence of a **race condition** when a resource is freed by one thread and then accessed by another that was expecting it to be valid.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence since it is a possible consequence of the **memory corruption** due to the **race condition**, but not explicitly stated)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also considered as a secondary candidate. Similar to CWE-416, the **memory corruption** stemming from the **race condition** could result in writing data outside the intended memory boundaries, thus triggering an out-of-bounds write. The similar CVE descriptions had CWE-787 as the top CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE. The **race condition** might allow one thread to overwrite memory belonging to another, thus writing out of bounds.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Medium confidence since it is a possible consequence of the **memory corruption** due to the **race condition**, but not explicitly stated)



## Known Examples for CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743): TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813): A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594): PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.
- **CVE-2008-2958** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
- **CVE-2008-1570** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1921**: Possible memory corruption due to Improper handling of hypervisor unmap operations for concurrent memory operations in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2021-29657**: arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.
- **CVE-2020-11233**: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition While processing partition entries due to newly created buffer was read again from mmc without validation in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables
- **CVE-2020-13882**: CISOfy Lynis before 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU race condition. The routine to check the log and report file permissions was not working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the race, an unprivileged attacker can set up a log and report file, and control that up to the point where the specific routine is doing its check. After that, the file can be removed, recreated, and used for additional attacks.
- **CVE-2020-15702**: TOCTOU Race Condition vulnerability in apport allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may exit the crashed process and exploit PID recycling to spawn a root process with the same PID as the crashed process, which can then be used to escalate privileges. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9 versions prior to 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.16 and 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.6. Was ZDI-CAN-11234.
