## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **rootcause** is "**unbounded connection acceptance**" which leads to "**file handle exhaustion**". This perfectly aligns with CWE-770, "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", because the server accepts connections without any limit, consuming OS resources. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also confirms this by stating that the root cause is the "The `blaze-core` library accepts connections without limit on its selector pool. This allows an unbounded queue to grow, consuming OS resources (socket handles) and potentially degrading service performance." MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-770 indicates it's ALLOWED, and the description matches the weakness. Since connection acceptance is not throttled, this allows for consumption of resources until exhaustion.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-770 is a Base level CWE. CWE-774, "Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling," is a Variant of a more general resource exhaustion. While file handles are being exhausted, the root cause is broader. CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE that represents resource exhaustion more generally, but it is also discouraged. CWE-770 is the best match, as it is a Base CWE and directly addresses the unlimited resource allocation.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
