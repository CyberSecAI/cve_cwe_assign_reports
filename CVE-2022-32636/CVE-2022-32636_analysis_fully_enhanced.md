```markdown
# Summary 
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Primary | The vulnerability description clearly indicates an out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow. |
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.85 | Base | Secondary | The vulnerability description indicates that an integer overflow is the root cause of the out-of-bounds write. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH


- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**out of bounds write** due to an **integer overflow**". This directly aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which describes a condition where data is written past the end of the intended buffer. The **integer overflow**, which is the **root cause**, is best represented by CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). CWE-787 is selected as the primary CWE as it's the direct consequence of the overflow. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this root cause and weakness relationship.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-190 can precede CWE-787 as an integer overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links).

## Known Examples for CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545): Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.
- **CVE-2021-30860** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30860](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30860): Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-30663** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663): Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2018-10887** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887): Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **CVE-2019-1010006** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006): Chain: compiler optimization (CWE-733) removes or modifies code used to detect integer overflow (CWE-190), allowing out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2010-2753** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753): Chain: integer overflow leads to use-after-free
- **CVE-2005-1513** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513): Chain: integer overflow in securely-coded mail program leads to buffer overflow. In 2005, this was regarded as unrealistic to exploit, but in 2020, it was rediscovered to be easier to exploit due to evolutions of the technology.
