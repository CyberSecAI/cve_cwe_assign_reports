|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-488 | Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.3 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves a **mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST** within libcurl, leading to the **exposure of data element to wrong session** when built with the Schannel TLS library. The cipher set, stored in a static variable, is inadvertently controlled by the last concurrent transfer, which affects all other transfers. This aligns directly with CWE-488 (Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session), as the data (cipher set) is being exposed to unintended sessions due to a coding error. The **root cause** is an incorrect implementation that does not properly isolate cipher settings between concurrent transfers.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found in the provided data. However, CWE-488 is a base level weakness which is preferred.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the clear description of the **root cause** and the direct match with CWE-488)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the vulnerability does not directly involve a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, the incorrect handling of cipher selection could lead to the use of weaker ciphers, potentially degrading transport security. Therefore, CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is considered a secondary candidate. However, the primary issue isn't the algorithm itself, but the flawed implementation affecting its selection. This is why it is a secondary candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-327 is a Class level weakness, and the mapping guidance suggests reviewing whether a Base-level child is more appropriate. The current description does not provide sufficient information to map to a specific child of CWE-327.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.4 (Low confidence because the link to cryptographic algorithms is indirect)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The potential for weakened transport security due to the vulnerability could result in **sensitive information** being transmitted in cleartext if weaker or null ciphers are selected. Thus, CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is also considered a secondary candidate. However, this is a potential impact rather than the core weakness itself.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.3 (Low confidence as this is an indirect consequence of the primary weakness)



## Known Examples for CWE-488: Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-22897**: curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrong session due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST when libcurl is built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected cipher set was stored in a single "static" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.
- **CVE-2022-23505**: Passport-wsfed-saml2 is a ws-federation protocol and SAML2 tokens authentication provider for Passport. In versions prior to 4.6.3, a remote attacker may be able to bypass WSFed authentication on a website using passport-wsfed-saml2. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed assertion. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. This issue is patched in version 4.6.3. Use of SAML2 authentication instead of WSFed is a workaround.
