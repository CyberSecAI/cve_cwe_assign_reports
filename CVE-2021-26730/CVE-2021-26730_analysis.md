## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" in a specific function. This directly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant-level CWE. The description indicates that this overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, highlighting the security impact. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" further confirms the **rootcause** as "**stack-based buffer overflow**".
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a broader category, the description explicitly mentions "stack-based," making CWE-121 a more specific and accurate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of stack-based buffer overflow with clear impact details)
