## Vulnerability Description
TOTOLINK T6 V4.1.9cu.5179_B20201015 was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the password parameter in the function FUN_00413f80.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **product:** TOTOLINK T6
- **version:** V4.1.9cu.5179_B20201015
- **component:** function FUN_00413f80

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` component of the Totolink T6-V2 router's firmware. Specifically, the `FUN_00413f80` function (located at address 0x413f80) is vulnerable.
- The function receives a JSON parameter named `password`. Without any length checks, it copies this password directly into local variables residing on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `password` parameter. By supplying an overly long password, an attacker can overwrite memory on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The stack overflow can be exploited to overwrite the return address or other critical data on the stack. This allows an attacker to gain control of the program's execution flow. While the provided information does not explicitly state the level of access an attacker might gain, such vulnerabilities can often be leveraged to achieve remote code execution on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable CGI script (`/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`).
- **JSON Payload:** The malicious payload is delivered as a JSON object with a large value for the `password` field, along with specific values for `encrypt` (set to "WEP") and `opmode` (set to "rpt").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This could be achieved by being on the same network as the router or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain network access if the web interface is not exposed to the public internet.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router, crafting the JSON payload containing the oversized password field.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerable CGI script and its parameters, as detailed in the provided information.

**Additional Details (not in the CVE description):**
- The content specifies the vulnerable firmware version (`T6-V2 V4.1.9cu.5179_B20201015`).
- It shows the specific code branch that is entered when `encrypt` is "WEP" and `opmode` is "rpt".
- The content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit script in Python using `pwn` library, which can be used to reproduce the vulnerability.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** in the TOTOLINK T6 router. The CVE reference summary confirms this, indicating the `FUN_00413f80` function copies the `password` parameter into stack-based local variables without proper length checks. This leads to a **stack buffer overflow** if the password exceeds the buffer size, aligning directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The 'Retriever Results' list CWE-121 as a highly relevant candidate.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), providing more specific information about the location of the buffer.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to clear evidence of stack overflow from the vulnerability description and CVE details.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.
