# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                       | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :----------------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95       | Variant                | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **heap overflow** in the `AP4_AtomTypeFromString` function of the Bento4 library. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary elaborates that this **heap-buffer-overflow** occurs due to reading beyond allocated memory in functions like `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString`, `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits`, and `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit`. Given the explicit mention of "**heap overflow**," CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is the most appropriate primary CWE. This is a Variant level CWE, providing a specific type of buffer overflow which aligns well with the provided information.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of a more general buffer overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence of a heap overflow from the vulnerability description and CVE reference details.)



## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
- **CVE-2020-21602**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
