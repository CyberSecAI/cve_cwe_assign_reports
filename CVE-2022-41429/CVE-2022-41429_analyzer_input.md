# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41429

## Vulnerability Description
Bento4 v1.6.0-639 was discovered to contain a **heap overflow** via the AP4_AtomTypeFromString function in mp4tag.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **product:** Bento4
- **version:** v1.6.0-639
- **component:** AP4_AtomTypeFromString function in mp4tag

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes three distinct heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities in the Bento4 library, as discovered through fuzzing:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString(char const*)`.
*   **Weakness:** The function `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString` reads beyond allocated memory when processing input strings.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to heap buffer overflow.
*  **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted MP4 file with a specific tag can trigger the overflow. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by the `--remove` option with an invalid tag.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker must be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to the `mp4tag` utility for processing.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits(unsigned int)`.
*   **Weakness:** The function `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits` reads beyond allocated memory when parsing bit streams.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to heap buffer overflow.
*   **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted MP4 file with a malformed H.264 track. Specifically, a crafted bitstream in the H264 track is parsed by `AP4_AvcFrameParser::ParsePPS`, leading to an out of bounds read in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker must be able to provide a crafted MP4 file with a malicious H264 stream to the `mp4mux` utility.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit()`.
*   **Weakness:** The function `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit()` reads beyond allocated memory when parsing bit streams.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to heap buffer overflow.
*   **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted MP4 file with a malformed H.264 track. Specifically, a crafted bitstream in the H264 track is parsed by `AP4_AvcFrameParser::ParseSliceHeader`, leading to an out of bounds read in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker must be able to provide a crafted MP4 file with a malicious H264 stream to the `mp4mux` utility.

The report also includes the following information:
*   The vulnerabilities were found via fuzzing.
*   Proof of concept files are available for each vulnerability.
*   The affected versions include the master branch and the release version `1.6.0-639`.
*   The environment used for testing was Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS with clang 12.0.1 and clang++ 12.0.1
