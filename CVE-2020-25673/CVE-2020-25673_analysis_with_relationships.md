| CWE-401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | 0.75 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE reference clearly indicate a **resource leak** in the `llcp_sock_connect()` function within the Linux kernel's NFC subsystem. The core issue arises because non-blocking sockets are not properly handled, leading to resources such as `llcp_sock->dev`, `llcp_sock->local`, `llcp_sock->ssap`, and `llcp_sock->service_name` not being freed. This directly aligns with CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime). The CVE summary explicitly mentions "Repeated calls to `llcp_sock_connect()` with non-blocking sockets causes a **resource leak** leading to a denial of service." This confirms that the resources are not released after their effective lifetime. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-772.
  - *CWE-401*: CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) is also relevant, as memory is a specific type of resource. However, since the description mentions a broader range of resources beyond just memory, CWE-772 is a more encompassing primary classification.

  - *Non Selection of other CWEs*:
    - CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-415 (Double Free) are not appropriate because the issue is not about using memory after it has been freed or freeing memory multiple times. The core problem is the initial failure to release resources.
    - CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-911 (Improper Update of Reference Count), CWE-362 (Race Condition), CWE-833 (Deadlock), CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) are not applicable as the root cause is not related to pointers, race conditions, deadlocks, uninitialized resources, or allocation limits.

- **Relationship Analysis:** "CWE-772 is a Base level CWE and has parent CWEs such as CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release). The vulnerability description focuses on the missing release of resources, making CWE-772 the more appropriate and specific choice. CWE-772 CanPrecede CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) since repeated resource leaks can lead to resource exhaustion."

- **Confidence Score:** 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of resource leak and the specific resources involved)
