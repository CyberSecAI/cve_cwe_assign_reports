## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability, which is not the CVE you specified. However, I will still extract the details:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Pre-authentication stack overflow

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow vulnerability. This occurs before authentication, meaning it can be exploited without requiring user credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:** The advisory states the CVSS score is 9.6, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a critical impact with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact. Exploitation could lead to remote code execution, denial of service or complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) meaning the attacker must be on the same local network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable NETGEAR device. No user interaction is needed (UI:N), and no privileges are required (PR:N).

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
*   D6220, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.68
*   D6400, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.102
*   D7000v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.74

*   R6300v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.50
*  R6400, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.68
*   R7000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.11.116
*   R7100LG, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.70
*   RBS40V, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.2.8
*   RBW30, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.2.2
*   RS400, running firmware versions prior to 1.5.1.80
*  R7000P, running firmware versions prior to 1.3.2.132
