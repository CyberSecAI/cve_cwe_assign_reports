# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-31227

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. A potential **heap buffer overflow** exists in the code that parses the HTTP POST request, due to an **incorrect signed integer comparison**. This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a malformed HTTP packet with a negative Content-Length, which bypasses the size checks and results in a large heap overflow in the wbs_multidata buffer copy.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect signed integer comparison**
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **vector:** malformed HTTP packet with a negative Content-Length
- **product:** HCC embedded InterNiche
- **version:** 4.0.1
