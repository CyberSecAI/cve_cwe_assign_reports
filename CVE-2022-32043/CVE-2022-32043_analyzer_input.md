# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-32043

## Vulnerability Description
Tenda M3 V1.0.0.12 was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the function formSetAccessCodeInfo.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **product:** Tenda M3
- **version:** V1.0.0.12
- **component:** formSetAccessCodeInfo function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-32043 (Based on the content, it relates to the identified vulnerability.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetAccessCodeInfo` function within the `httpd` binary. This function is accessible via the URL `goform/setAccessCodeData`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `formSetAccessCodeInfo` function retrieves POST parameters `info` and `logo_pic_name`. It copies these parameters to stack buffers without proper bounds checking. This lack of validation allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates that exploiting this vulnerability can crash the device, causing a denial of service. It's implied that remote code execution (RCE) might be possible by overwriting the return address on the stack, but there isn't any explicit information on that.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setAccessCodeData` endpoint.
- **Malicious Parameters:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request containing excessively long values for the `info` and `logo_pic_name` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Tenda M3 device.
- **HTTP POST Request Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device.
- **Authentication:** It is implied from the provided information that the attacker needs to be authenticated with a cookie named `user` equal to `admin`.
