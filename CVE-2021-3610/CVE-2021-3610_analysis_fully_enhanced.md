# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant |  Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.85 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.75 | Variant | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **heap-based buffer overflow** due to an **incorrect setting of the pixel array size**. This directly corresponds to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a buffer overflow where the buffer is allocated on the heap. The description also mentions that the issue stems from an **incorrect calculation of the extent variable**, which is used to determine the size of the memory allocation, aligning with CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size). The combination of the two weaknesses, the heap buffer overflow, and the cause, the incorrect size calculation, make both CWEs relevant. CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is also plausible, since the pixel array size is incorrectly set and could lead to a large memory allocation.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of buffer overflow (CWE-119) and is a good fit because the overflow occurs on the heap. CWE-131 can precede CWE-119. CWE-789 is a child of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the clear description of a heap-based buffer overflow and incorrect size calculation)
