# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-45417

## Vulnerability Description
AIDE before 0.17.4 allows local users to obtain root privileges via crafted file metadata (such as XFS extended attributes or tmpfs ACLs), because of a **heap-based buffer overflow**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** obtain root privileges
- **vector:** crafted file metadata
- **attacker:** local users
- **product:** AIDE
- **version:** before 0.17.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-45417:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `encode_base64` and `decode_base64` functions within AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment). These functions use a fixed-size buffer of 16384 bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Fixed-size buffer:** The `encode_base64` and `decode_base64` functions use a fixed-size buffer, which is insufficient when handling large extended file attributes or Access Control Lists (ACLs).
*   **Base64 encoding of extended attributes and ACLs:** AIDE versions 0.13 and later encode extended file attributes and ACL values using the vulnerable base64 functions before writing them to the database. This was not the original use case for the functions (hash sums) where the fixed size buffer was safe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By creating a file with a large extended attribute or ACL, an attacker can cause AIDE to crash (segfault) due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user with the ability to write extended attributes or ACLs on a filesystem can exploit this flaw to potentially gain root privileges by crashing AIDE (which is usually run as root by cron).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to create files with large extended attributes or ACLs on a mounted filesystem.
*   **File System:** Filesystems such as XFS (extended attributes) and tmpfs (ACLs) are suitable for triggering this vulnerability.
*   **AIDE Configuration:** AIDE must be compiled with either the `--with-xattr` or `--with-posix-acl` configuration flag. This is the default configuration for most distributions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local user account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the target system.
*   **Write access:** The attacker needs write access to a mounted filesystem that supports extended attributes (e.g., XFS) or ACLs (e.g., tmpfs).
*   **Knowledge of AIDE:** The attacker should be familiar with AIDE configuration and operation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in AIDE version 0.13 with the addition of extended attribute and ACL support.
*   The fix involves pre-calculating the size of the output buffer before encoding/decoding to avoid overflowing.
*   The vulnerability affects AIDE versions 0.13 up to and including 0.17.3
*   Patches for versions 0.16.x and 0.17.x are available.
*   The issue was reported by David Bouman.
