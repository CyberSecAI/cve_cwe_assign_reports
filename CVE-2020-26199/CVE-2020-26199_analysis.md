## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **"plain-text password storage"** vulnerability, where user credentials, including the Unisphere admin password, are stored in plain text in multiple log files. This directly aligns with CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), which describes a product storing sensitive information in cleartext within a resource accessible to another control sphere. A local attacker with access to log files can exploit this to gain unauthorized access. The CWE for similar CVE Descriptions also lists CWE-312 as the Primary CWE Match and Top CWE. The Retriever results lists CWE-312 with a good score and usage is "Allowed".
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate. It is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), but CWE-312 is more specific because it highlights storage in cleartext, rather than just the absence of encryption.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence and mapping guidance)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The passwords being stored in plain text are specifically located in log files. This aligns with CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). This CWE describes the product writing sensitive information to a log file. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section supports this by stating "User credentials, including the Unisphere admin privilege user password, are stored in plain text within multiple log files". The CWE for similar CVE Descriptions also lists CWE-532 as a Top CWE. The Retriever results lists CWE-532 with a good score and usage is "Allowed".
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-532 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (High confidence due to direct evidence and mapping guidance)
