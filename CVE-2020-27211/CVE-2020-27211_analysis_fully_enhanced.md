## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**improper protection against physical side channels**". The CVE reference summary further details that the **root cause** is a weakness in the cryptographic implementation, leading to information leakage via electromagnetic side-channels. This aligns directly with CWE-1300 (Improper Protection of Physical Side Channels), which describes devices lacking sufficient protection mechanisms against physical side channels. The evidence is strong, as the description and summary highlight the core issue: side-channel vulnerability due to inadequate protection. CWE-1300 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate as it directly describes the **weakness**.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1300 has relationships to more specific weaknesses. It could be caused by things like Observable Discrepancy CWE-203 or Observable Timing Discrepancy CWE-208.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong match between vulnerability description and CWE definition, supported by CVE reference details)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions "injecting a **fault** during the boot phase" to bypass flash read-out protection. This aspect suggests CWE-1332 (Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips) as a contributing factor. While the primary issue is the lack of protection against side channels, the ability to inject a fault and bypass security mechanisms indicates that the system does not properly handle such faults. CWE-1332 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1332 is related to CWE-1247 (Improper Protection Against Voltage and Clock Glitches) and is a child of CWE-1384. The ability to inject a fault during boot to bypass protection could potentially be related to a voltage or clock glitch.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (The fault injection aspect is less prominent than the side-channel vulnerability, making this a secondary consideration.)



## Known Examples for CWE-1384: Improper Handling of Physical or Environmental Conditions
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-17391** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17391](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17391): Lack of anti-glitch protections allows an attacker to launch a physical attack to bypass the secure boot and read protected eFuses.


## Known Examples for CWE-1247: Improper Protection Against Voltage and Clock Glitches
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-17391** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17391](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17391): Lack of anti-glitch protections allows an attacker to launch a physical attack to bypass the secure boot and read protected eFuses.
- **CVE-2021-33478** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-33478](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-33478): IP communication firmware allows access to a boot shell via certain impulses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-33478**: The TrustZone implementation in certain Broadcom MediaxChange firmware could allow an unauthenticated, physically proximate attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution in the TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of an affected device. This, for example, affects certain Cisco IP Phone and Wireless IP Phone products before 2021-07-07. Exploitation is possible only when the attacker can disassemble the device in order to control the voltage/current for chip pins.


## Known Examples for CWE-1332: Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-15894** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15894](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15894): fault injection attack bypasses the verification mode, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-27212**: STMicroelectronics STM32L4 devices through 2020-10-19 have incorrect access control. The flash read-out protection (RDP) can be degraded from RDP level 2 (no access via debug interface) to level 1 (limited access via debug interface) by injecting a fault during the boot phase.


## Known Examples for CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-8695** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-8695](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-8695): Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.
- **CVE-2019-14353** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-14353](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-14353): Crypto hardware wallet's power consumption relates to total number of pixels illuminated, creating a side channel in the USB connection that allows attackers to determine secrets displayed such as PIN numbers and passwords
- **CVE-2019-10071** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10071](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10071): Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2002-2094** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-2094](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-2094): This, and others, use ".." attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.
