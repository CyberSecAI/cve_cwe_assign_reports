## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content details three distinct heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities found in Bento4, a multimedia processing library.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString(char const*)`.
*   **Weakness:** The `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString` function attempts to read a string, and if the provided string is too large, it results in writing past the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input to `mp4tag` tool when using the `--remove` option.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a specific input file to `mp4tag`.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits(unsigned int)`.
*  **Weakness:** The `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits` function reads a specified number of bits from a buffer, and it appears that the function doesn't properly check for boundary conditions and reads out of bounds of the allocated memory.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input to `mp4mux` tool when using the `--track h264` option.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a specific input file to `mp4mux`.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit()`.
*   **Weakness:** The `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit` function, which is used to read a single bit from a bit stream, appears to not properly handle cases where it attempts to read past the end of allocated buffer, resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input to `mp4mux` tool when using the `--track h264` option.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to provide a specific input file to `mp4mux`.

The provided information includes:
*   Detailed crash logs from AddressSanitizer (ASan), showing the exact locations of the buffer overflows, the affected functions, and the call stacks.
*   Specific commands to trigger the vulnerabilities with `mp4tag` and `mp4mux`.
*   Proof-of-concept (POC) files for each vulnerability.
*   The affected versions of Bento4 (master branch and release version 1.6.0-639).
*   The environment used for testing (Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS, clang 12.0.1).

This content provides more specific information about the vulnerabilities than the typical CVE description, including the exact functions, tools, and input triggers to cause the crash.
