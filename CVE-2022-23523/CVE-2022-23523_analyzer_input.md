# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-23523

## Vulnerability Description
In versions prior to 0.8.1, the linux-loader crate uses the offsets and sizes provided in the ELF headers to determine the offsets to read from. If those offsets point beyond the end of the file this could lead to Virtual Machine Monitors using the `linux-loader` crate entering an infinite loop if the ELF header of the kernel they are loading was modified in a malicious manner. This issue has been addressed in 0.8.1. The issue can be mitigated by ensuring that only trusted kernel images are loaded or by verifying that the headers do not point beyond the end of the file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reading beyond file bounds**
- **impact:** infinite loop
- **vector:** malicious ELF header in kernel
- **product:** linux-loader crate
- **version:** prior to 0.8.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `linux-loader` crate used offsets and sizes from ELF headers to read data. If these offsets pointed beyond the end of the file, it could lead to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the loader did not validate if the offsets from the ELF header were within the bounds of the file being loaded.
- **Infinite Loop:**  When reading beyond the end of the file, the loader would enter an infinite loop due to the read operation not returning an error and continuing to attempt to read data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Availability Impact:** Exploiting this vulnerability would cause a denial-of-service by inducing an infinite loop, rendering the virtual machine monitor unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor could modify the ELF header of a kernel image, inserting offsets that point beyond the end of the file.
- The malicious ELF file would then be loaded using the vulnerable `linux-loader` crate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify the kernel image (ELF header) before it is loaded by the `linux-loader` crate. This implies a position where they can tamper with the kernel image.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the loading of the modified kernel image using the vulnerable `linux-loader` library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity
- The fix for this issue is in version 0.8.1, where the `Read::read_exact()` is used for reading which will return an error if the read would go past the end of the file.
- The fix was introduced in PR #125, titled "loader: x86_64: elf: Avoid reading beyond file end."
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 0.8.1
- The provided CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
