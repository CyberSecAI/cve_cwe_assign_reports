# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**buffer overflow**" exists in the heap, leading to potential heap corruption. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms the root cause as a "Heap buffer overflow in ANGLE". Given this information, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a strong candidate because it describes the general case of writing data past the end of a buffer. The description notes that the vulnerability can be triggered by visiting a crafted HTML page.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It has child CWEs for specific types of out-of-bounds writes (heap, stack etc).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is also considered because the vulnerability is explicitly described as a heap **buffer overflow**. This is a variant of CWE-787 and represents a more specific case. While CWE-787 is the better primary mapping because it is a base level CWE, CWE-122 is a valid secondary candidate due to the explicit mention of "heap".
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787. Choosing this CWE would give greater specificity given that it is a heap overflow. However, the more general CWE-787 is preferrable as the primary mapping being a base level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
