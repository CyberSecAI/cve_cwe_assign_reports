# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-25928

## Vulnerability Description
The DNS feature in InterNiche NicheStack TCP/IP 4.0.1 is affected by Buffer Overflow. The impact is execute arbitrary code (remote). The component is DNS response processing functions dns_upcall(), getoffset(), dnc_set_answer(). The attack vector is a specific DNS response packet. The code does not check the response data length field of individual DNS answers, which may cause **out-of-bounds read/write operations**, leading to Information leak, Denial-or-Service, or Remote Code Execution, depending on the context.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read/write operations**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** specific DNS response packet
- **product:** InterNiche NicheStack TCP/IP
- **version:** 4.0.1
- **component:** DNS response processing functions dns_upcall(), getoffset(), dnc_set_answer()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-25928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the NicheStack's DNSv4 response parsing routine. Specifically, the code does not validate the "response data length" field of individual DNS answers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read/Write (OOB-R/W):** The lack of proper validation allows the parsing routine to read or write beyond the allocated memory bounds, potentially causing a crash, information disclosure, or remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted DNS response to a device using the vulnerable NicheStack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target device, usually by being on the same network or having some routing capabilities to the target network.
*   **DNS Spoofing:** To trigger the vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to inject or alter the DNS response received by the target device.  This could involve a man-in-the-middle attack or by poisoning the DNS cache of a device.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a set of 14 vulnerabilities collectively called "INFRA:HALT" affecting the NicheStack TCP/IP stack.
*   The vulnerable code is in the DNSv4 client component of the stack.
*   All versions of NicheStack before version 4.3 (including NicheLite) are affected.
*   A video demonstration of the exploit is available.
*   The Forescout blog and CERT vulnerability note include mitigation recommendations.
*   Forescout has released tools for detecting vulnerable devices and for detecting exploitation attempts.
*   The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSSv3.1 score of 9.8.
