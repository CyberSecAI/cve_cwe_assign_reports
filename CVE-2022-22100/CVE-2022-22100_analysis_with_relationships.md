# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-823 | Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

| CWE-1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates **memory corruption** due to an **improper check on received export descriptors**. This suggests a potential **use of out-of-range pointer offset**, as described in CWE-823. The "**improper check**" implies that the offset used for pointer arithmetic might not be validated, leading to memory access outside the intended boundaries. While **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) could also be a consequence, CWE-823 more directly reflects the root cause of using an incorrect offset. Similarly, CWE-1285, while relevant (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input ), is less specific than CWE-823, which directly addresses pointer offsets. According to MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-823 is ALLOWED at the Base level of abstraction.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-823 is a Base-level CWE. It is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-823 can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) or CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), as using an out-of-range pointer offset can lead to writing to or reading from unintended memory locations.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description, supported by retriever results)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered as a secondary candidate because the primary issue is the **improper check** that leads to potentially writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. While the provided description doesn't explicitly state a write operation, the **memory corruption** implies that data is being written to an incorrect location.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It can follow CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset) since an incorrect pointer offset can cause a write operation outside the intended memory buffer.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.65 (The weakness might result in an out-of-bounds write, although this is not explicitly stated)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) is also considered as a secondary candidate. The **improper check on received export descriptors** might indicate that the index or offset used to access memory isn't correctly validated. The vulnerability description refers to the **improper check**, but CWE-823 focuses on the arithmetic, while CWE-1285 describes the broader lack of validation.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1285 is a base-level CWE. It is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.65 (The improper check on descriptors can include a malformed index)
