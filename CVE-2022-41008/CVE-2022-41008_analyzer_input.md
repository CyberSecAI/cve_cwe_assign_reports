# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41008

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no port redirect protocol (tcp|udp|tcp/udp) inport dstaddr A.B.C.D export description WORD command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format strings based on user-supplied parameters without proper bounds checking on the size of the user-supplied input, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted network packet containing a sequence of commands to the vulnerable `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and must have the credentials to access the `DetranCLI` interface."
