# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**stack buffer overflow** issues were found in Opensc before version 0.22.0 in various places". This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-121, which is "A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms the **root cause** as "Stack buffer overflow when processing ACL data", and "Incorrect calculation of remaining bytes", which both align with a stack-based buffer overflow. The impact also aligns, with reports of "Programs using the library could crash" and "Potential crash". The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED for stack-based buffer overflows, solidifying this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a more general case, the specific mention of "stack" makes CWE-121 a more precise and appropriate choice. There are no further relationships which would require a different mapping.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference materials, and MITRE mapping guidance)
