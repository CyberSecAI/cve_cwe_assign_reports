- **impact:** unexpected syntactic changes
- **product:** xmldom
- **version:** 0.6.0 and older

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `xmldom` library's failure to properly escape special characters when serializing XML elements that have been removed from their ancestor. Specifically, when an XML document is parsed and then serialized, special characters within attribute values are not consistently escaped if the element is no longer part of its original parent structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Output Handling:** The core weakness is the incorrect handling of special characters (`<`, `&`, `"`) during XML serialization.
- **Inconsistent Escaping:** The library escapes special characters in some scenarios but fails to do so when elements are detached from their original context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XML Syntactic Changes:** Maliciously crafted XML input can be altered during processing because of incorrect serialization. This can lead to unexpected syntactic changes in XML during a round trip (parse and serialize).
- **Potential Application Vulnerabilities:** Downstream applications that process the serialized XML could be impacted if they assume consistent syntax and proper escaping. This may result in application logic errors or potentially security vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious XML Input:** An attacker provides specially crafted XML containing unescaped special characters within attribute values
- **Round-trip Processing:** The target application uses `xmldom` to parse the malicious XML, manipulates the parsed data (specifically removing nodes from their parent), then serializes this modified document using `xmldom`. The serialized output will contain unescaped special characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted XML document that will be processed by a vulnerable application.
- The target application must use `xmldom` for parsing and serialization, and manipulate the parsed data in a way that triggers the vulnerability (i.e., detaching elements from their parents).
- An attacker would need to understand the underlying XML processing logic and be able to introduce XML structures that are then modified (nodes removed from parents) by the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to vulnerabilities discovered in Go's `encoding/xml` library regarding round-trip transformations.
- The fix for this issue involves correctly escaping special characters in attribute values even when the element is no longer part of its ancestor.
- The vulnerability is considered moderate severity.
- The patched versions are `@xmldom/xmldom@>=0.7.0`.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the `xmldom` library's failure to correctly escape special characters when serializing XML elements, particularly after they've been removed from their ancestor. This **failure to properly escape special characters** directly leads to **improper encoding or escaping of output**, which aligns with CWE-116. The CVE description highlights that the core issue is the inconsistent handling of special characters (`<`, `&`, `"`) during XML serialization.  While the description doesn't pinpoint a specific encoding scheme being missed, the general class of improper encoding is evident.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-116 is a Class-level CWE, and it might have more specific Base-level children. However, without more information about the specific encoding or escaping mechanism that's failing, CWE-116 is appropriate. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-116 is related to input validation and data sanitization issues.  CWE-91 is also considered since the problem occurs with XML and special elements are not neutralized.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that `xmldom` does not correctly escape special characters, potentially leading to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing. This indicates that the XML structure is not being properly handled, and the special characters are not being neutralized. CWE-91 directly addresses the **improper neutralization of special elements in XML**. The CVE reference summary confirms the **improper output handling** and that the library doesn't properly escape special characters (`<`, `&`, `"`) during XML serialization.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-91 is a base level CWE and directly related to XML structures. It is a peer of other CWEs that describe improper neutralization in other data formats. It is a reasonable secondary mapping because of the context of XML.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.70 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-91: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly neutralize special elements that are used in XML, allowing attackers to modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system.

### Extended Description
Within XML, special elements could include reserved words or characters such as "<", ">", """, and "&", which could then be used to add new data or modify XML syntax.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ParentOf -> CWE-643
ParentOf -> CWE-652

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The description for this entry is generally applicable to XML, but the name includes "blind XPath injection" which is more closely associated with CWE-643. Therefore this entry might need to be deprecated or converted to a general category - although injection into raw XML is not covered by CWE-643 or CWE-652.

**[Theoretical]** In vulnerability theory terms, this is a representation-specific case of a Data/Directive Boundary Error.

**[Research Gap]** Under-reported. This is likely found regularly by third party code auditors, but there are very few publicly reported examples.





## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

### Extended Description


Improper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.


Most products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" is a structured message containing a command ("GET") with a single argument ("/index.html") and metadata about which protocol version is being used ("HTTP/1.1").


If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using the ESAPI Encoding control [REF-45] or a similar tool, library, or framework. These will help the programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.


Alternately, use built-in functions, but consider using wrappers in case those functions are discovered to have a vulnerability.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Parameterization
- **Description:** 

If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.


For example, stored procedures can enforce database query structure and reduce the likelihood of SQL injection.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.

**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


However, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.


**[Terminology]** The usage of the "encoding" and "escaping" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the "escape" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.

**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.

**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.
