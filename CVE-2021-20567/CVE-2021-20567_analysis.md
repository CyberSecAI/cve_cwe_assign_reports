| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**improper or nonexisting encryption**" which directly points to a lack of encryption for sensitive data. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that secrets within the Resilient App Host are **not encrypted by default**. This aligns with CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), which is a Class-level CWE. While CWE-311 is a class, the evidence doesn't provide enough details to map to a more specific Base or Variant CWE. The secrets are viewable in cleartext by the "root" user, suggesting that the sensitive data is stored unencrypted, making CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) a relevant secondary consideration. MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-311 in favor of more precise children, but in this case, a more specific child cannot be determined and the use of the parent is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-311 is a parent of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability involves storing secrets in cleartext within a Kubernetes environment, accessible to the "root" user. This makes CWE-312 a related but less encompassing weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
