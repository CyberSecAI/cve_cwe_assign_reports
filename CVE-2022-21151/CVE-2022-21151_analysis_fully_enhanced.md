| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-1037  | Processor Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code | 0.90       | Base                  | Primary CWE                     | Allowed                       |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **rootcause** is "**Processor optimization removal or modification of security-critical code**". The Retriever Results list CWE-1037 "Processor Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code" as the top candidate with a score of 0.7799. The description for CWE-1037 aligns precisely with the vulnerability: "The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the processor optimizes the execution of the program such that the mechanism is removed or modified."
The advisory indicates the **impact** is "information disclosure", which suggests unauthorized access to sensitive data. While information disclosure is a symptom rather than a root cause, the **rootcause** is the **processor optimization** issue.
Since CWE-1037 is a Base level CWE and the description exactly matches the vulnerability description, it is selected as the primary CWE.
CWE-497 (Uncontrolled System Information) is considered as a secondary CWE since the **impact** of the vulnerability is information disclosure.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1037 has no direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-1037's definition, as well as the explicit mention of processor optimization as the root cause.)

## Known Examples for CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-32638** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32638](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32638): Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0291**: An Exposure of System Data vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, where a sensitive system-level resource is not being sufficiently protected, allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to send specific traffic which partially reaches this resource. A high rate of specific traffic may lead to a partial Denial of Service (DoS) as the CPU utilization of the RE is significantly increased. The SNMP Agent Extensibility (agentx) process should only be listening to TCP port 705 on the internal routing instance. External connections destined to port 705 should not be allowed. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.3R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 13.2R1.
- **CVE-2021-26067**: Affected versions of Atlassian Bamboo allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace that may reveal the path for the home directory in disk and if certain files exists on the tmp directory, via a Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability in the /chart endpoint. The affected versions are before version 7.2.2.
- **CVE-2021-21336**: Products.PluggableAuthService is a pluggable Zope authentication and authorization framework. In Products.PluggableAuthService before version 2.6.0 there is an information disclosure vulnerability - everyone can list the names of roles defined in the ZODB Role Manager plugin if the site uses this plugin. The problem has been fixed in version 2.6.0. Depending on how you have installed Products.PluggableAuthService, you should change the buildout version pin to 2.6.0 and re-run the buildout, or if you used pip simply do `pip install "Products.PluggableAuthService>=2.6.0"`.
- **CVE-2021-21360**: Products.GenericSetup is a mini-framework for expressing the configured state of a Zope Site as a set of filesystem artifacts. In Products.GenericSetup before version 2.1.1 there is an information disclosure vulnerability - anonymous visitors may view log and snapshot files generated by the Generic Setup Tool. The problem has been fixed in version 2.1.1. Depending on how you have installed Products.GenericSetup, you should change the buildout version pin to 2.1.1 and re-run the buildout, or if you used pip simply do pip install `"Products.GenericSetup>=2.1.1"`.
- **CVE-2021-21376**: OMERO.web is open source Django-based software for managing microscopy imaging. OMERO.web before version 5.9.0 loads various information about the current user such as their id, name and the groups they are in, and these are available on the main webclient pages. This represents an information exposure vulnerability. Some additional information being loaded is not used by the webclient and is being removed in this release. This is fixed in version 5.9.0.
- **CVE-2021-22135**: Elasticsearch versions before 7.11.2 and 6.8.15 contain a document disclosure flaw was found in the Elasticsearch suggester and profile API when Document and Field Level Security are enabled. The suggester and profile API are normally disabled for an index when document level security is enabled on the index. Certain queries are able to enable the profiler and suggester which could lead to disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.
- **CVE-2022-22303**: An exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere vulnerability [CWE-497] in FortiManager versions prior to 7.0.2, 6.4.7 and 6.2.9 may allow a low privileged authenticated user to gain access to the FortiGate users credentials via the config conflict file.
- **CVE-2022-34458**:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere vulnerability in download operation component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to the disclosure of confidential data. 
- **CVE-2022-22961**: VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager and vRealize Automation contain an information disclosure vulnerability due to returning excess information. A malicious actor with remote access may leak the hostname of the target system. Successful exploitation of this issue can lead to targeting victims.
