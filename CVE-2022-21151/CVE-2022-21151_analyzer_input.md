### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Processor optimization removal or modification of security-critical code**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **vector:** local access
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** Intel(R) Processors

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-21151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from "processor optimization removal or modification of security-critical code" in some Intel processors. This suggests that during the optimization process, certain security checks or mechanisms were either removed or altered, creating a potential weakness.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core weakness is the unintended alteration or removal of security-critical code during processor optimization, leading to an exploitable condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to "information disclosure". This implies that an attacker might gain access to sensitive data that should otherwise be protected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is described as "local access", indicating that the attacker needs to have some form of access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an "authenticated user" with local access to the system. This suggests that the attacker needs to have legitimate credentials to log in to the system.
*   The advisory also lists the CVSS vector as  `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`, which provides a more technical breakdown:
    *   **AV:L (Local):** The attack must originate from a local system.
    *   **AC:H (High):** The conditions for a successful exploit are complex and difficult to achieve.
    *   **PR:H (High):** The attacker requires high privileges to perform the attack.
    *   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **S:C (Changed):**  A successful exploit can affect resources beyond the attacker's control, i.e. a different security context.
    *   **C:H (High):** There is a high potential for a loss of confidentiality, meaning that the attacker could gain access to a significant amount of sensitive data.
    *   **I:N (None):** There is no impact on the integrity of the system or data.
    *    **A:N (None):** There is no impact on the availability of the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** Intel has released firmware updates (microcode) to address this vulnerability. System manufacturers are expected to provide these updates to end-users. An Intel SGX TCB recovery is also planned.
*   **Affected Products:** Multiple Intel processor families are affected, including 6th to 10th generation Intel Core processors, Pentium and Celeron series processors, and some 3rd generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors.
*   **NetApp Impact:** NetApp confirms that some of their products that incorporate Intel chipsets are affected. The advisory lists specific affected FAS/AFF BIOS models and which models are not affected.
* **Debian Impact:** Debian has issued a security advisory (DSA-5178-1) with updated microcode to address CVE-2022-21151, as well as other related MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2022-21151 is a vulnerability that arises from processor optimizations that unintentionally weaken security, allowing a high privileged local attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information. Mitigation is achieved through microcode updates provided by Intel and system manufacturers.
