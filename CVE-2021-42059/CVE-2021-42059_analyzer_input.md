## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-42059:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow in the DisplayTypeDxe driver within InsydeH2O UEFI firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in the UEFI DXE driver

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows a local root user to execute arbitrary code.
- Potential for disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).
- Could lead to escalating privileges to System Management Mode (SMM).

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- Attacker needs to be a local root user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local root privileges on the system.

**Affected InsydeH2O Kernel versions:**
- Kernel 5.0 before 05.08.41
- Kernel 5.1 before 05.16.41
- Kernel 5.2 before 05.26.41
- Kernel 5.3 before 05.35.41
- Kernel 5.4 before 05.42.20

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located in the DisplayTypeDxe driver.
- It was reported by the Binarly efiXplorer team.
- Fixed versions are provided for different kernel versions, but the document does not list specific fixes for NetApp products.
- NetApp has stated that they are aware of public discussion about this vulnerability.
- Siemens indicates that a successful attack requires the attacker to be able to run untrusted code on the affected system.
