# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **buffer overread** that occurs when parsing a STUN message, specifically the error reason string within the error code attribute. The root cause is a missing length check before copying the string, leading to reading beyond the allocated buffer. This aligns directly with CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), which describes a product reading data past the end of the intended buffer. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states "**Heap Buffer Overflow:** Specifically, the `decode_errcode_attr` function in `pjnath/src/pjnath/stun_msg.c` is vulnerable. The code does not properly validate the length of the error reason string against the available buffer, leading to a read beyond the allocated memory." CWE-126 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever results also lists CWE-126 as the top match. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-126 indicates this is ALLOWED for buffer over-read vulnerabilities.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a variant of the broader CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), but since the vulnerability specifically involves reading past the end of a buffer, CWE-126 is more precise. CWE-126 does not have any specified CanFollow or CanPrecede relationships, according to the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the explicit description of the buffer overread and the confirmation from the CVE reference materials.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is included as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves parsing a STUN message where the length of the error reason string is not properly validated before copying it. The CVE description notes "**Missing Length Check:** The code fails to ensure that the attribute length is sufficient before attempting to copy the error reason string using `pj_strdup`.". This indicates that the input (the length of the string) is not validated correctly. CWE-1284 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever results also lists CWE-1284 as the second best match. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1284 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 does not have any specified CanFollow or CanPrecede relationships, according to the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Medium confidence because it's not the primary weakness, but contributes to the vulnerability.)



## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
