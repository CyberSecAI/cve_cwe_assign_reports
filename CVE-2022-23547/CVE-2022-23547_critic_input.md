- **product:** PJSIP

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow during the parsing of STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) error code attributes within a STUN message. The issue arises specifically when handling the error reason string, where a missing length check before copying the string to the attribute leads to a potential over-read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:**  Specifically, the `decode_errcode_attr` function in `pjnath/src/pjnath/stun_msg.c` is vulnerable. The code does not properly validate the length of the error reason string against the available buffer, leading to a read beyond the allocated memory.
- **Missing Length Check:** The code fails to ensure that the attribute length is sufficient before attempting to copy the error reason string using `pj_strdup`.
- **Integer Parsing Issue:** The commit message also mentions a fix for "uint parsing", this suggests an issue might have existed during the parsing of unsigned integer values within the STUN message

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Buffer Overread:** An attacker can craft a malicious STUN message with a manipulated error code attribute that causes the application to read beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although not explicitly stated, a heap buffer over-read can potentially cause a crash or lead to other memory corruption issues that an attacker might leverage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious STUN Message:** An attacker needs to send a specially crafted STUN message to a vulnerable application. This message would include an error code attribute with a crafted length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to send STUN messages to the vulnerable application.
- **STUN Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the STUN protocol and be able to construct malicious STUN messages with the vulnerable attributes.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects applications using STUN, specifically including PJNATH and PJSUA-LIB which are part of the PJSIP project.
- The fix was implemented in commit `bc4812d`.
- The vulnerability is a continuation of `GHSA-9pfh-r8x4-w26w` suggesting an earlier similar vulnerability was found.
- The issue was reported by Google's OSS-Fuzz.
- The affected versions are 2.13 or lower. The patched version is 2.13.1

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **buffer overread** that occurs when parsing a STUN message, specifically the error reason string within the error code attribute. The root cause is a missing length check before copying the string, leading to reading beyond the allocated buffer. This aligns directly with CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), which describes a product reading data past the end of the intended buffer. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states "**Heap Buffer Overflow:** Specifically, the `decode_errcode_attr` function in `pjnath/src/pjnath/stun_msg.c` is vulnerable. The code does not properly validate the length of the error reason string against the available buffer, leading to a read beyond the allocated memory." CWE-126 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever results also lists CWE-126 as the top match. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-126 indicates this is ALLOWED for buffer over-read vulnerabilities.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a variant of the broader CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), but since the vulnerability specifically involves reading past the end of a buffer, CWE-126 is more precise. CWE-126 does not have any specified CanFollow or CanPrecede relationships, according to the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the explicit description of the buffer overread and the confirmation from the CVE reference materials.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is included as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves parsing a STUN message where the length of the error reason string is not properly validated before copying it. The CVE description notes "**Missing Length Check:** The code fails to ensure that the attribute length is sufficient before attempting to copy the error reason string using `pj_strdup`.". This indicates that the input (the length of the string) is not validated correctly. CWE-1284 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever results also lists CWE-1284 as the second best match. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1284 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 does not have any specified CanFollow or CanPrecede relationships, according to the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Medium confidence because it's not the primary weakness, but contributes to the vulnerability.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788
CanFollow -> CWE-170

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.



## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-789
ParentOf -> CWE-606

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
