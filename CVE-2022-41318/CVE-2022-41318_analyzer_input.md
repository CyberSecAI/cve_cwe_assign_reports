# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41318

## Vulnerability Description
A **buffer over-read** was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6. Due to **incorrect integer-overflow protection**, the SSPI and SMB authentication helpers are vulnerable to reading unintended memory locations. In some configurations, cleartext credentials from these locations are sent to a client. This is fixed in 5.7.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect integer-overflow protection**
- **weakness:** **buffer over-read**
- **impact:** cleartext credentials
- **product:** Squid
- **version:** 2.5 through 5.6
- **component:** SSPI and SMB authentication helpers

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41318:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect integer overflow protection within the Squid SSPI and SMB authentication helpers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Buffer Over-read.
- Integer Overflow.
- Memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote client can cause a DoS by exploiting the buffer overflow.
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote client can extract sensitive information from the machine's memory, including decrypted user credentials and potentially other arbitrary memory areas beyond Squid and the authentication helper.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network.
- The vulnerability is triggered during NTLM or Negotiate authentication when Squid is configured to use vulnerable helpers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote client.
- No specific user interaction or privileges are required.
-  The attacker needs to be able to initiate an authentication request using NTLM or Negotiate.

**Affected Versions:**
- Squid versions 2.5.STABLE1 to 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x to 3.5.28, 4.x to 4.17, and 5.x to 5.6 are affected.
- Vulnerable helpers include: `ntlm_smb_lm_auth`, `ntlm_sspi_auth`, `ntlm_fake_auth`, and `negotiate_sspi_auth`.

**Patched Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Squid version 5.7. Patches for older stable releases are also available.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in the `libntlmauth` library, which is used by the affected authentication helpers.
- The CVSS score is 8.2 (or 8.9 according to the GitHub source) with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H.
- The vulnerability was discovered by LWIC and fixed by Amos Jeffries based on the patch by LWIC.
