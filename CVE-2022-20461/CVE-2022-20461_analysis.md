# Analysis for CVE-2022-20461

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-843 | Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('**Type Confusion**') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is caused by accessing a resource using an incompatible type. |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This is the result of the type confusion. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**type confusion**" which leads to an "**out of bounds read**". CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('**Type Confusion**')) perfectly matches the root cause. The "**out of bounds read**" is a consequence of this **type confusion**, therefore CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a secondary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Summary indicates "Buffer Overflow" which is related to out-of-bounds access, but the primary driver here is the type confusion leading to the read. The retriever results also list CWE-843 as a highly relevant candidate.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-843 does not have direct relationships listed. However, it can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mentions of "**type confusion**" and "**out of bounds read**" in the vulnerability description).
