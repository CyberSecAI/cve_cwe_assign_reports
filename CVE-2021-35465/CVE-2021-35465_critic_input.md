## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.6
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that Arm products "do not properly consider the effect of exceptions on a VLLDM instruction." This aligns with CWE-754 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions), as the vulnerability arises from the system's failure to adequately handle exceptions during the execution of a specific instruction. The impact, where "a Non-secure handler may have read or write access to part of a Secure context," reinforces this by highlighting a security breach stemming from mishandled exceptions. Since the description is at a higher level and doesn't provide specifics on how the exceptional condition is mishandled, CWE-754 is selected, noting that more specific child CWEs might exist with further details. The MITRE mapping guidance is "Allowed-with-Review," suggesting a possibility of more specific entries.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-754 is a Class-level CWE, and it has potential child CWEs that could be more specific if more details were available. Given the limited details in the description, it is difficult to pinpoint a more specific CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium evidence based on the vulnerability description and the general nature of the failure.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is considered a secondary candidate because it's a closely related Class-level CWE that describes a product's failure to handle exceptional conditions correctly. Given that the root cause involves the "effect of exceptions" during the execution of a VLLDM instruction, this CWE is relevant. However, since CWE-754 is slightly broader and the description doesn't clearly specify that the handling is incorrect (vs. a missing check), CWE-755 is ranked lower. The MITRE mapping guidance is "Discouraged" because it's a Class-level CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-755 is a Class-level CWE and is related to CWE-754 as they both deal with exception handling.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.4 (Lower confidence as it's a closely related alternative but less directly supported by the evidence.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is another potential candidate as it describes issues related to anticipating or handling rare exceptional conditions. While relevant to exception handling, it is a Pillar-level CWE, making it very broad. The evidence does not strongly support this particular CWE over the more specific CWE-754. The MITRE mapping guidance is "Discouraged" due to its extremely high-level nature.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-703 is a Pillar-level CWE and is a very broad category.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.3 (Low confidence because it's a very high-level CWE and not as directly supported by the evidence compared to CWE-754.)

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

### Extended Description


The programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions, thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability, incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability.


Note that this entry is not exclusively about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Choose languages with features such as exception handling that force the programmer to anticipate unusual conditions that may generate exceptions. Custom exceptions may need to be developed to handle unusual business-logic conditions. Be careful not to pass sensitive exceptions back to the user (CWE-209, CWE-248).


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is expected.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** If using exception handling, catch and throw specific exceptions instead of overly-general exceptions (CWE-396, CWE-397). Catch and handle exceptions as locally as possible so that exceptions do not propagate too far up the call stack (CWE-705). Avoid unchecked or uncaught exceptions where feasible (CWE-248).



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2007-3798:** Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.
- **CVE-2006-4447:** Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.



## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Pillar

### Description
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a high-level class that might have some overlap with other classes. It could be argued that even "normal" weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2022-22224:** Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)
