# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-35091

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-704 | Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a possible **out of bounds read** due to **improper typecasting** while handling a page fault. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) directly addresses the **weakness** of reading data past the end of the intended buffer. CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast) is considered as a contributing factor, as the **improper typecasting** is the root cause that leads to the out-of-bounds read. CWE-125 is chosen as the primary CWE because the description specifically states an "out of bounds read."
  The retriever results show CWE-125 as a candidate, and its description aligns well with the stated vulnerability. The usage for CWE-125 is "Allowed".
  CWE-704 is a "Class" level of abstraction, which suggests that a more specific child CWE might be more appropriate. However, without additional evidence pinpointing the exact type of conversion error, CWE-704 serves as a reasonable secondary candidate to capture the root cause of the vulnerability. Its usage is "Allowed-with-Review".

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a base weakness and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It can be caused by incorrect calculations or improper validation of indices (CWE-129). CWE-704 is a class weakness, and there are no direct relationships listed in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct mention of "out of bounds read" and "improper typecasting" in the description, aligning well with the chosen CWEs)

## Known Examples for CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-3979** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3979](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3979): Chain: data visualization program written in PHP uses the "!=" operator instead of the type-strict "!==" operator (CWE-480) when validating hash values, potentially leading to an incorrect type conversion (CWE-704)
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-27219**: An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to memory corruption.
- **CVE-2021-1027**: In setTransactionState of SurfaceFlinger, there is possible arbitrary code execution in a privileged process due to improper casting. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-12Android ID: A-193033243
- **CVE-2021-46333**: Moddable SDK v11.5.0 was discovered to contain an invalid memory access vulnerability via the component __asan_memmove.
- **CVE-2021-23566**: The package nanoid from 3.0.0 and before 3.1.31 are vulnerable to Information Exposure via the valueOf() function which allows to reproduce the last id generated.
- **CVE-2021-28275**: A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in jhead 3.04 and 3.05 due to a wild address read in the Get16u function in exif.c in will cause segmentation fault via a crafted_file.
- **CVE-2021-35091**: Possible out of bounds read due to improper typecasting while handling page fault for global memory in Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2021-35110**: Possible buffer overflow to improper validation of hash segment of file while allocating memory in Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2021-43537**: An incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers allowed an attacker to corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.
