# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Buffer Over-read | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.50 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" in `jsiValueObjDelete` function in `src/jsiEval.c`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, indicating a heap-buffer-overflow occurs when deleting a property of an array after unshifting elements. This aligns directly with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of buffer overflow occurring in the heap. The description also mentions a read of size 8 at a wild pointer location, suggesting a potential buffer over-read (CWE-125) as a consequence. The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating an array, which involves setting a property, deleting a property, and unshifting elements.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-120 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a more general case, CWE-122 is more specific and accurately describes the vulnerability's location (heap). CWE-125 (Buffer Over-read) can be a consequence of the heap overflow. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) could be a contributing factor, though not explicitly stated.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence and direct match to the CWE description)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The CVE summary states there is a read of size 8 at a wild pointer location. This suggests a read outside the intended buffer boundary, which aligns with CWE-125 (Buffer Over-read). While the primary issue is the heap overflow, the act of reading beyond the buffer could be a related weakness.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a base level CWE that can be caused by other issues like an off-by-one error, or integer overflows. Because the primary root cause is the heap overflow, this is a secondary weakness that is a consequence of the overflow.
- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Moderate evidence from read at wild pointer location)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The description of the heap overflow does not directly state that the buffer size calculation is incorrect, however, it is often a contributing factor to buffer overflows. If the allocation size is insufficient, it can cause overflows.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-131 is a base level CWE that is the root cause of many buffer overflows. Since the description only mentions the presence of the overflow, and not the root cause being an incorrect calculation, the confidence is not as high.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.50 (Weak, due to lack of explicit mention of incorrect calculation)
