# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-20690

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause Cisco Discovery Protocol memory corruption on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to **missing length validation checks** when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid Cisco Discovery Protocol packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal Cisco Discovery Protocol database of the affected device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to missing length validation checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) messages within the Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Length Validation:** The software fails to properly validate the length of certain fields within CDP packets. This allows an attacker to send crafted packets with malformed lengths.
- **Out-of-bounds read**: Due to the missing length validation, processing of the crafted CDP packet could lead to an out-of-bounds read of valid CDP packet data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** A successful exploit could lead to an out-of-bounds read of valid CDP packet data, causing memory corruption within the device's internal CDP database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Adjacent:** The attacker needs to be in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the affected Cisco ATA 190 device.
- **Malicious CDP Packet:** The attacker sends a specifically crafted CDP packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Layer 2 Adjacency:** The attacker must be on the same Layer 2 network segment as the targeted device.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Products:**
    - Cisco ATA 190 (On-premises only)
    - Cisco ATA 191 (On-premises or Multiplatform)
    - Cisco ATA 192 (Multiplatform only)
- **Fix:** Cisco has released firmware updates to address this issue for ATA 191 and ATA 192. There are no fixes for ATA 190 as it has reached End of Life.
- **Workaround:** Disable CDP on the LAN interface of the device. This can be done through the web UI at `Network Setup > Advanced Settings > CDP &LLDP` by unchecking `Enabled CDP`.
- **CVSS Score:** Base score of 5.3 with vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N`
