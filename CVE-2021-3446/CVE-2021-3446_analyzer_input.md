# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3446

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **returned initial IV instead of last IV**
- **impact:** weaken subsequent encryption and decryption
- **product:** libtpms
- **version:** before 0.8.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of the Initialization Vector (IV) within the `libtpms` library when used with OpenSSL for symmetric encryption/decryption. Specifically, the library was returning the initial IV instead of the last-used IV after a cryptographic operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect IV Handling:** The primary issue is the failure to return the updated IV after a symmetric encryption or decryption operation using OpenSSL.
- **Use of OpenSSL API:** The issue is related to the integration of `libtpms` with OpenSSL and how it retrieves the IV. Older versions of OpenSSL did not provide a direct function to retrieve the IV, leading to the faulty logic in `libtpms`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Confidentiality Loss**: By returning the initial IV instead of the last used IV, subsequent encryption and decryption steps are weakened, potentially allowing an attacker to decrypt data that should have been protected. This leads to a loss of data confidentiality.
- **Decryption Issues**: Data encrypted using a chain of operations may not be decryptable after the fix is applied, due to the change in IV handling. This can lead to data corruption or inaccessibility if not handled properly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Symmetric Cipher Usage:** The vulnerability is triggered when `libtpms` uses symmetric ciphers in conjunction with OpenSSL, particularly AES and TDES.
- **Chained Encryptions:** When data is encrypted using a chain of cryptographic operations, the incorrect IV handling becomes particularly critical, as each step relies on the correct IV from the prior step.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to libtpms**: The attacker would need to have access to an application or system that is utilizing the vulnerable version of `libtpms`.
- **Knowledge of cryptographic operations**: The attacker would need a working knowledge of cryptographic operations including the use of IVs and symmetric ciphers.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The fix involves copying the last-used IV from OpenSSL so that it can be correctly returned to the caller.
- The issue was fixed in `libtpms` versions 0.7.7 and 0.8.2.
- The vulnerability is present in the commonly used integration of `libtpms` with OpenSSL.
- The bug report on Red Hat Bugzilla indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization was affected.

In summary, CVE-2021-3446 is a vulnerability in `libtpms` where the library fails to properly return the last-used IV when using OpenSSL for symmetric encryption, potentially leading to data compromise.
