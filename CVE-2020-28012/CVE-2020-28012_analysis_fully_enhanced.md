# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-28012

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-403 | Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | The primary weakness is the **exposure of file descriptor to unintended control sphere**. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.4 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate: The resource (file descriptor) is exposed to the wrong control sphere, but CWE-403 is more specific. |
| CWE-250 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate: The process executes at a higher privilege level than necessary, exacerbating the impact. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly state the **exposure of a file descriptor to an unintended control sphere** due to the missing close-on-exec flag. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-403 "Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')". The root cause lies in the failure to properly manage file descriptors, allowing an unprivileged process to access a privileged pipe. The impact is local privilege escalation, as the attacker can write crafted data to the pipe and overwrite system files. CWE-403 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-403 indicates this is ALLOWED. While CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a related Class-level CWE, CWE-403 provides a more specific description of the weakness. CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) is another possible weakness because the Exim process is running with root privileges. However, the core issue is the file descriptor leak, making CWE-403 the primary weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-403 has no direct relationships defined in the provided information. However, in a broader context, it can be considered related to resource management and privilege management. The vulnerability chain involves the missing close-on-exec flag (CWE-403) leading to a controlled memory corruption and local privilege escalation."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to explicit mention of the **exposure of the file descriptor** and detailed technical analysis).

- **CVE-2000-0094** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0094](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0094): Access to restricted resource using modified file descriptor for stderr.
- **CVE-2002-0638** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0638](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0638): Open file descriptor used as alternate channel in complex race condition.
- **CVE-2003-0489** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0489](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0489): Program does not fully drop privileges after creating a file descriptor, which allows access to the descriptor via a separate vulnerability.
- **CVE-2003-0937** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0937](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0937): User bypasses restrictions by obtaining a file descriptor then calling setuid program, which does not close the descriptor.
- **CVE-2004-2215** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2215](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2215): Terminal manager does not properly close file descriptors, allowing attackers to access terminals of other users.
- **CVE-2006-5397** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-5397](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-5397): Module opens a file for reading twice, allowing attackers to read files.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-28012**: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere because rda_interpret uses a privileged pipe that lacks a close-on-exec flag.


## Known Examples for CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-4217** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4217](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4217): FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.
