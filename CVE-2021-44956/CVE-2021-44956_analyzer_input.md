# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-44956

## Vulnerability Description
Two **Heap based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in ffjpeg through 01.01.2021. It is similar to CVE-2020-23852. Issues that are in the jfif_decode function at ffjpeg/src/jfif.c (line 552) could cause a Denial of Service by using a crafted jpeg file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Heap based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **vector:** crafted jpeg file
- **product:** ffjpeg
- **version:** through 01.01.2021
- **component:** jfif_decode function at ffjpeg/src/jfif.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `jfif_decode` function within `jfif.c`. Specifically, it arises from insufficient boundary checks when accessing memory buffers `yuv_datbuf[1]` and `yuv_datbuf[2]`. The code calculates offsets into these buffers using `uy * yuv_stride[1] + ux` and `vy * yuv_stride[2] + vx` respectively, without ensuring that these offsets remain within the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The lack of boundary checks leads to heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. Specifically, out-of-bounds reads occur at `jfif.c:552:31` and `jfif.c:552:38`. These reads try to access memory locations outside the allocated regions of `yuv_datbuf[1]` and `yuv_datbuf[2]`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a program crash, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output showing heap-buffer-overflow errors and subsequent abortion of the program.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information does not explicitly state, heap overflows can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited maliciously through carefully crafted inputs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JPEG Image:** The primary attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted JPEG image that triggers the vulnerable code paths within the `jfif_decode` function. The provided proof-of-concept (POC) files `decode_poc1.zip` and `decode_poc2.zip` demonstrate this.
- **Input manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the YUV color data and dimensions within the JPEG image to control the calculations of `ux`, `uy`, `vx`, and `vy` and therefore influence the memory addresses accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG file to the vulnerable application. This could be through a variety of vectors, such as loading the image directly, uploading the image to a server, or processing it in another way.
- **No special privileges required:** The exploit does not require any special system privileges to execute, as it's triggered by processing a malformed file.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is related to previously reported vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-23852 and CVE-2020-13439, as mentioned in a comment within the issue.
- The code responsible for allocating the memory for `yuv_datbuf` is located at `jfif.c:443-444`.
- The vulnerable code is located at `jfif.c:550-552`, where the memory is accessed without bounds checks.

The analysis includes details that go beyond the basic description given by the CVE, by including the specific locations of the vulnerability, the root cause, and the attack vector, and impact.
