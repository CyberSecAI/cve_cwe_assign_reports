## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-34583:

**Vulnerability 1: Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow occurs when the CODESYS V2 web server copies data from a 0x100-byte stack-based buffer to a heap-based communication buffer. The size of the copy operation is controlled by the attacker.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of proper bounds checking on the attacker-controlled copy size.
    *   Usage of `memcpy` without validating the size argument.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A large copy size can cause a buffer over-read on the stack or a buffer over-write on the heap which can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** When configured with an external CODESYS Control runtime, a large copy size can leak stack contents over the network.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure, including an oversized `copy_size`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 2: Heap-based Buffer Over-read/Over-write**

*   **Root Cause:** The CODESYS V2 web server performs an in-place XOR-based encoding of user-supplied data. The length of the data to be encoded is controlled by the attacker and can exceed the actual size of the input data.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing validation of the attacker controlled encode length.
    *   In-place XOR encoding with insufficient bounds checking, leading to out-of-bounds read/write.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Heap corruption due to out-of-bounds write can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a specific message structure containing a base64 encoded string to be decoded and an overly large encode length.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 3: Message |9 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|9'. The web server does not check the return value of `strchr` which may lead to a NULL pointer.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|9".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 4: Message |10 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|10'. Similar to the previous vulnerability, the web server does not check the result of `strchr`.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    * Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|10".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 5: Message |b or |e NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|b' or '|e'. Like before, the return value of `strchr` is not validated.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference crashes the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|b" or "|e".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 6: Message Parsing State 4 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*  **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message in parsing state 4, specifically when the `psHexNum` pointer is not initialized.
*   **Weaknesses:**
     *   Missing validation that the pointer `psHexNum` is not NULL.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference crashes the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a message that triggers the parsing state 4 and causes the `psHexNum` pointer to remain NULL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 7: Message |6 Invalid Memory Access DoS**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory read access violation occurs when the web server processes a message starting with '|6', due to unchecked return value of `strchr` and path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
    *   Path traversal vulnerability via file extension field.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory access violation due to the NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system. Arbitrary file read when combined with path traversal.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Path Traversal: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure that includes a path traversal sequence in the file extension field, causing it to read arbitrary files.
    *   Uploaded File: Uploading a file with message type 3 and then force the server to process the file content with a message of type 6.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

The provided content also includes mitigation recommendations, such as applying the provided software updates, activating user management on the CODESYS V2.3 WebVisu, using firewalls, VPN, and other general security practices.
