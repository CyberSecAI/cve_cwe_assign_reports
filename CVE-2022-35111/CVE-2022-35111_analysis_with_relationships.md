# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-35111 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack overflow**" in SWFTools. The CVE reference links content summary further confirms this, stating "Stack overflow during the processing of a crafted PDF file. There are multiple instances, one in `sanitizer_stackdepot.cpp`". CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability, where a buffer on the stack is overwritten. This is further supported by the vulnerability report mentioning `sanitizer_stackdepot.cpp`. Other CWEs, such as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are not applicable, as the vulnerability is explicitly described as a stack overflow.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-120 (Classic Buffer Overflow) and is related to other memory corruption issues. The overflow on the stack can potentially lead to control-flow hijacking or other exploitable conditions.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "stack overflow" in the description and CVE details)
