## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **"small space of random values"** in the FortiSandbox RPC API, which directly aligns with CWE-334 (Small Space of Random Values). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms that the root cause is the insufficient randomness used for generating session IDs, making them predictable. This aligns perfectly with CWE-334's description: "The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks." The impact, as stated, is that an attacker could **"predict valid session IDs,"** which further validates the relevance of CWE-334. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-334 indicates that it is ALLOWED, which strengthens the selection of this CWE. CWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) and CWE-339 (Small Seed Space in PRNG) are considered as secondary candidates because they address aspects of predictability, but CWE-334 provides a more precise match to the core weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-334 is a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), which is a Class-level CWE. While CWE-330 is relevant, CWE-334 is a more specific Base-level CWE that better represents the vulnerability. CWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) shares a PEEROF relationship with CWE-339 (Small Seed Space in PRNG), indicating that the predictability could be influenced by observable states. The relationship analysis supports the selection of CWE-334 as the primary weakness with possible contributions from CWE-341.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, combined with MITRE mapping guidance).

- **CVE-2021-26909**: Automox Agent prior to version 31 uses an insufficiently protected S3 bucket endpoint for storing sensitive files, which could be brute-forced by an attacker to subvert an organization's security program. The issue has since been fixed in version 31 of the Automox Agent.
- **CVE-2021-44151**: An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. As the session cookies are small, an attacker can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application (e.g., /goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized content, when a valid cookie value is hit.
- **CVE-2022-3959**: A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in drogon up to 1.8.1. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component Session Hash Handler. The manipulation leads to small space of random values. The attack may be launched remotely. Upgrading to version 1.8.2 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is c0d48da99f66aaada17bcd28b07741cac8697647. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

## CWE-339: Small Seed Space in PRNG
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) uses a relatively small seed space, which makes it more susceptible to brute force attacks.

### Extended Description
PRNGs are entirely deterministic once seeded, so it should be extremely difficult to guess the seed. If an attacker can collect the outputs of a PRNG and then brute force the seed by trying every possibility to see which seed matches the observed output, then the attacker will know the output of any subsequent calls to the PRNG. A small seed space implies that the attacker will have far fewer possible values to try to exhaust all possibilities.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-335
PeerOf -> CWE-341

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use well vetted pseudo-random number generating algorithms with adequate length seeds. Pseudo-random number generators can produce predictable numbers if the generator is known and the seed can be guessed. A 256-bit seed is a good starting point for producing a "random enough" number.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Requirements
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems, or use the more recent FIPS 140-3 [REF-1192] if possible.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry may have a chaining relationship with predictable from observable state (CWE-341).

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10908:** product generates passwords via org.apache.commons.lang.RandomStringUtils, which uses java.util.Random internally. This PRNG has only a 48-bit seed.



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

### Extended Description
When product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Use a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and select well-tested implementations with adequate length seeds.


In general, if a pseudo-random number generator is not advertised as being cryptographically secure, then it is probably a statistical PRNG and should not be used in security-sensitive contexts.


Pseudo-random number generators can produce predictable numbers if the generator is known and the seed can be guessed. A 256-bit seed is a good starting point for producing a "random enough" number.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Consider a PRNG that re-seeds itself as needed from high quality pseudo-random output sources, such as hardware devices.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Testing
- **Description:** Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.
