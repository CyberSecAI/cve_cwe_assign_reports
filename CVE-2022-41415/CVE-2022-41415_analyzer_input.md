# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41415

## Vulnerability Description
Acer Altos W2000h-W570h F4 R01.03.0018 was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** in the RevserveMem component. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via injecting crafted shellcode into the NVRAM variable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** injecting crafted shellcode into the NVRAM variable
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Acer Altos W2000h-W570h F4
- **version:** R01.03.0018
- **component:** RevserveMem component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41415:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ReserveMem` driver within the UEFI firmware of Acer Altos servers. It stems from the incorrect use of the `gRT->GetVariable` service.
- A hardcoded `DataSize` parameter (1827) is significantly larger than the buffer allocated on the stack to store the retrieved variable's value. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Improper use of `gRT->GetVariable` with a hardcoded, oversized buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the UEFI DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase.
- Potential for a malicious code to be installed that can survive OS reboots by modifying NVRAM area in SPI flash storage.
- The attacker can control the RIP (instruction pointer) and overwrite the return address.

**Attack vectors:**
- Modifying the NVRAM variable `ReserveMemFlag`. This can be done either physically (with access to the server) or remotely if there are vulnerabilities that allow remote NVRAM modification.
- Setting the variable to a large string that exceeds the allocated stack buffer, causing a buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify NVRAM variables of the target system, either physically or remotely.
- Technical knowledge to craft shellcode and exploit the stack buffer overflow.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific Acer Altos server models (Altos W2000h-W570h F4) with firmware version released on 2019.02.13.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `sub_32C` function located at offset `0x32c` within the `ReserveMem` driver.
- The exploit uses a `nsh` script to set the `ReserveMemFlag` variable to a long string of 'A's, which overwrites the return address on the stack.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary code by hijacking control flow and printing a string to the console.

The content from `acer.com` and `altos.com` is irrelevant to the vulnerability, and the github content provides full details of the vulnerability.
