# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-33020

## Vulnerability Description
Philips Vue PACS versions 12.2.x.x and prior uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **use cryptographic key or password past its expiration date**
- **product:** Philips Vue PACS
- **version:** 12.2.x.x and prior
