## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that "Philips Vue PACS versions 12.2.x.x and prior **uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date**, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key." This directly matches the description of CWE-324 "Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: "**Root Cause:** The software uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date" and "**Vulnerability:** Use of a key past its expiration date (CWE-324)." The CWE-324 is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction. The Usage is "Allowed" with the rationale "This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-324 has no direct relationships in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match from the vulnerability description and CVE reference).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-324: Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.

### Extended Description
While the expiration of keys does not necessarily ensure that they are compromised, it is a significant concern that keys which remain in use for prolonged periods of time have a decreasing probability of integrity. For this reason, it is important to replace keys within a period of time proportional to their strength.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
PeerOf -> CWE-298

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Adequate consideration should be put in to the user interface in order to notify users previous to the key's expiration, to explain the importance of new key generation and to walk users through the process as painlessly as possible.
