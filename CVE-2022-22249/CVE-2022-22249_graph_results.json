  "query": "An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When there is a continuous mac move a memory corruption causes one or more FPCs to crash and reboot. These MAC moves can be between two local interfaces or between core/EVPN and local interface. The below error logs can be seen in PFE syslog when this issue happens xss_event_handler(1071) EA[00]_PPE 46.xss[0] ADDR Error. ppe_error_interrupt(4298) EA[00]_PPE 46 Errors sync xtxn error xss_event_handler(1071) EA[00]_PPE 1.xss[0] ADDR Error. ppe_error_interrupt(4298) EA[00]_PPE 1 Errors sync xtxn error xss_event_handler(1071) EA[00]_PPE 2.xss[0] ADDR Error.
