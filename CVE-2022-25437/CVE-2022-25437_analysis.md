## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states there is a **stack overflow** in the SetVirtualServerCfg function due to the list parameter. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE that specifically describes a buffer overflow occurring on the stack. This aligns directly with the vulnerability description. The description clearly indicates the location of the overflow (stack) and the general weakness (**buffer overflow**)."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) which is a more general case of a buffer overflow. Given the specific mention of a 'stack overflow', CWE-121 is a more precise classification. No other CWEs in the retriever results or similar CVE descriptions offer a more specific or accurate characterization of this vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and clear indication of **stack overflow**)
