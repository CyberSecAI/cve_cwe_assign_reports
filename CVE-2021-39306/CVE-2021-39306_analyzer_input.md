## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39306:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the client code of the Realtek RTL8195AM device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the Authentication challenge text in WEP security.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a large-sized Authentication challenge text during WEP authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within range to interact with the vulnerable device. They need the capability to send malicious WEP authentication packets, specifically crafting a large authentication challenge text.
- No specific capabilities or prior privileges are specified, but this attack vector assumes the attacker has basic networking and wireless communication skills.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected product is Realtek RTL8195AM.
- The vulnerable version is prior to 2.0.10.
- The vulnerability was discovered by hac425xxx (github.com/hac425xxx).
