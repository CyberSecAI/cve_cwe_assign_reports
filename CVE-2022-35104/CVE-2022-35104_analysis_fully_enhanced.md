# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-35104

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                     | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :------- | :--------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **heap-buffer overflow** in the `DCTStreamreset()` function of SWFTools. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability, where the overflow occurs in memory allocated on the heap. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, detailing multiple heap buffer overflows in SWFTools, including one specifically in `DCTStream::reset`, which aligns with the described vulnerability in `DCTStreamreset()`. The description states "**heap-buffer overflow** via DCTStreamreset() at /xpdf/Stream.cc". CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a broader category that includes heap overflows, but CWE-122 is more specific and therefore more appropriate.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), indicating a direct parent-child relationship. CWE-787 describes the general condition of writing data outside the intended buffer, while CWE-122 specifies that this occurs in the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, specifically mentioning heap buffer overflow in the affected function.)

## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
