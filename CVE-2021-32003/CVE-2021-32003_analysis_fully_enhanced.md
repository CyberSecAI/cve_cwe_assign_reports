# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-32003

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-523 | Unprotected Transport of Credentials | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves the unprotected transport of credentials, directly matching the CWE description and usage guidelines. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The vulnerability involves transmitting credentials in an unprotected manner, which could be considered a form of cleartext transmission. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is the **unprotected transport of credentials**, as stated in the vulnerability description. This directly maps to CWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials). The description explicitly mentions that a local attacker can capture credentials if the SiteManager provisioning service is used after provisioning. This is because the credentials are being transmitted in an insecure manner. The CWE definition states that "Login pages do not use adequate measures to protect the user name and password while they are in transit from the client to the server," which aligns perfectly with the described vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-523 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-523 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. It is related to CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a Class level CWE and therefore less specific. CWE-523 is also related to CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), indicating that storing credentials insecurely can lead to unprotected transport.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with the vulnerability description and the CWE definition.)

## Known Examples for CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32003**: Unprotected Transport of Credentials vulnerability in SiteManager provisioning service allows local attacker to capture credentials if the service is used after provisioning. This issue affects: Secomea SiteManager All versions prior to 9.5 on Hardware.
- **CVE-2020-12061**: An issue was discovered in Nitrokey FIDO U2F firmware through 1.1. Communication between the microcontroller and the secure element transmits credentials in plain. This allows an adversary to eavesdrop the communication and derive the secrets stored in the microcontroller. As a result, the attacker is able to arbitrarily manipulate the firmware of the microcontroller.
- **CVE-2021-41092**: Docker CLI is the command line interface for the docker container runtime. A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry. This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. For users unable to update ensure that any configured credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the PATH.
- **CVE-2021-37400**: An attacker may obtain the user credentials from the communication between the PLC and the software. As a result, the PLC user program may be uploaded, altered, and/or downloaded.
- **CVE-2021-20826**: Unprotected transport of credentials vulnerability in IDEC PLCs (FC6A Series MICROSmart All-in-One CPU module v2.32 and earlier, FC6A Series MICROSmart Plus CPU module v1.91 and earlier, WindLDR v8.19.1 and earlier, WindEDIT Lite v1.3.1 and earlier, and Data File Manager v2.12.1 and earlier) allows an attacker to obtain the PLC Web server user credentials from the communication between the PLC and the software. As a result, the complete access privileges to the PLC Web server may be obtained, and manipulation of the PLC output and/or suspension of the PLC may be conducted.
- **CVE-2022-34371**: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.3, contain an unprotected transport of credentials vulnerability. A malicious unprivileged network attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to full system compromise.
