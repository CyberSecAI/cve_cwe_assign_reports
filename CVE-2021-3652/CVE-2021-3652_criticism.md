# Criticism for CVE-2021-3652

Okay, here's a detailed review of the provided analysis, considering the full CWE specifications:

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is well-structured and presents a reasonable argument for the primary CWE assignment. The explanation of why CWE-916 is a better fit than CWE-287 and CWE-798 is sound. The confidence score reflects the strong evidence provided by the CVE reference summaries.

**Detailed Critique:**

1.  **CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort (Primary)**

    *   **Assessment:** This is the most accurate primary CWE choice. The core issue is that the asterisk is being treated as a valid "hash," but it effectively provides *no* computational effort to protect the password.  Any password can bypass authentication. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-916.
    *   **Strengths:** The explanation clearly links the "asterisk as a hash" to the concept of "insufficient computational effort." The rationale in the analysis highlights that this bypasses the *intended* password hashing mechanism.
    *   **Considerations:** It's important to recognize that the asterisk *isn't* actually a hash; it's a misinterpretation of input.  The system should be rejecting it as an invalid value for the password hash field.  This distinction is subtle, but important for understanding the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigations:** The mitigations for CWE-916 are highly relevant.  The analysis implicitly acknowledges this by pointing out that the asterisk effectively bypasses the "intended password hashing mechanism". Proper mitigation here involves using secure, adaptive hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2) with salting.  Input validation is also key to prevent '*' from being accepted.

2.  **CWE-287: Improper Authentication (Secondary)**

    *   **Assessment:**  This is a valid secondary CWE, but the analysis correctly identifies it as less specific than CWE-916. The vulnerability ultimately leads to improper authentication, as the system fails to correctly verify the user's identity.
    *   **Strengths:** It captures the *result* of the vulnerability â€“ authentication bypass.
    *   **Weaknesses:** As the analysis states, CWE-287 is a Class level CWE and discouraged for use when more specific CWEs are applicable.  It's a general symptom rather than a root cause.
    *   **Mapping Guidance:** The CWE-287 specification itself *discourages* its use when more specific CWEs exist, and suggests considering children like CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) or CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).
    *   **Mitigations:** While the general mitigations for CWE-287 (using authentication frameworks) are applicable, they don't directly address the root cause.

3.  **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (Secondary)**

    *   **Assessment:**  This is the weakest of the three CWEs selected. While the asterisk *could* be interpreted as a form of hardcoded bypass credential, it's a stretch.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   The examples in the CWE-798 specification involve *explicitly* hard-coded passwords or keys used for authentication or communication.  The asterisk is more about incorrect handling of an invalid hash value than a deliberately hardcoded credential.
        *   The asterisk isn't a traditional "credential". It isn't intended for authentication. It's supposed to represent a disabled or invalid password (at least according to the intended behavior).
    *   **Mitigations:** The mitigations for CWE-798 (storing credentials securely, avoiding default credentials) are not directly applicable to this vulnerability.

**Improvements and Alternative CWE Considerations:**

1.  **Improper Input Validation:**  The analysis could benefit from explicitly mentioning the lack of input validation as a contributing factor.  This leads to an alternate CWE:
    *   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**: The software fails to validate input properly before using it.  The '*' should be flagged as an invalid character or string for a password hash. This is the underlying mechanism allowing the 'asterisk' to be accepted.
    *   **CWE-155: Improper Neutralization of Wildcards or Matching Symbols**: While the asterisk is not used in its wildcard nature for this specific vulnerability, it is considered as a character with special meaning when used as a password hash which is then improperly neutralized, leading to unintended behavior.

2.  **CWE Refinement:** Instead of CWE-287, a better secondary CWE could be CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials, with review. The '*' in password hashes would categorize as a weak credential because it is easily guessed and doesn't offer any security.

3.  **Chain of Vulnerabilities:** A more complete analysis would describe the vulnerability as a *chain* of weaknesses:

    *   Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) leads to...
    *   Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort (CWE-916) leads to...
    *   Improper Authentication (CWE-287)

**Revised CWE Selection and Confidence:**

*   **Primary: CWE-916 (0.90 Confidence):** Strong evidence and directly reflects the root cause.
*   **Secondary: CWE-20 (0.75 Confidence):** Lack of validation allows the initial vulnerability to occur.
*   **Tertiary: CWE-1391 (0.60 Confidence):** Weak Credentials. The asterisk has no strength and is easily bypassed.

**Conclusion:**

The original analysis is a good starting point. The primary CWE selection is accurate. Strengthening the analysis by explicitly including CWE-20 and CWE-1391 and framing the vulnerability as a chain of weaknesses would provide a more complete and nuanced understanding of the issue. The confidence scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect the revised CWE selection.
