# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-29776 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability is described as a stack overflow. |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The root cause mentions a missing bounds check leading to potential out-of-bounds reads. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **stack overflow** in Onlyoffice Document Server v6.0.0 and below and Core 6.1.0.26 and below via the component DesktopEditor/common/File.cpp. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of buffer overflow occurring specifically on the stack. The CVE reference details indicate a missing bounds check, which contributed to a heap buffer overflow; however, the initial vulnerability description mentions **stack overflow**, so CWE-121 is chosen as the primary weakness. Additionally, the reference to missing bounds check and `clamp_buffer` aligns with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) as a secondary weakness, since the lack of validation can lead to reading beyond the buffer's boundaries."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-125 is related to buffer overflows as a potential cause or consequence."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of stack overflow and supporting details.)
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Medium confidence: While out-of-bounds read is related, the primary description focuses on a stack overflow. It's a contributing factor but not the main vulnerability described.)
