# Critic Input for CVE-2022-25219



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
A **null byte interaction error** has been discovered in the code that the telnetd_startup daemon uses to construct a pair of ephemeral passwords that allow a user to spawn a telnet service on the router, and to ensure that the telnet service persists upon reboot. By means of a crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker on the local network can leverage this **null byte interaction error** in such a way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with 1-in-94 odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by the OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher (CVE-2022-25218).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **null byte interaction error**
- **impact:** make those ephemeral passwords predictable
- **vector:** crafted exchange of UDP packets
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker on the local network
- **component:** telnetd_startup daemon

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities in Phicomm router firmware.  Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability specifically related to CVE-2022-25219:

**CVE-2022-25219:** This CVE is related to an insecure backdoor in the Phicomm router firmware that allows attackers on the local network to obtain a root shell.

*   **Root Cause:** The `telnetd_startup` daemon listens on UDP port 21210 and is intended to allow a client with a specific RSA private key to launch a `telnetd` service for root shell access without further authentication. However, the implementation is flawed due to insufficient validation of the decrypted data and the usage of `sprintf` with a `%s` specifier which is vulnerable to null byte injection.

*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Backdoor:** A hidden service (`telnetd_startup`) listening on UDP port 21210 intended to provide privileged access.
    *   **Flawed Cryptographic Implementation:** The design of the backdoor relies on flawed assumptions about the security of public key encryption, particularly regarding predictable outputs of public key decryption with crafted ciphertext.
    *   **Null Byte Injection:** By crafting specific ciphertext, attackers can inject a null byte at the start of a buffer used to construct the ephemeral password for telnet access. The use of sprintf with %s causes it to interpret this buffer as an empty string, resulting in predictable passwords.
    *   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The absence of a rate-limiting mechanism allows attackers to rapidly attempt the exploit.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Root Shell Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain a root shell on the device.
    *   **Full Control:**  A root shell provides complete control over the router.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Network:** Attackers must be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
    *   **UDP Port 21210:** Exploitation occurs through sending specially crafted packets to UDP port 21210.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the local network of the target device.
    *   The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the router on port 21210.
    *   The attacker must have the ability to craft and send the malicious packets to exploit the backdoor.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that different versions of the firmware have variations in the protocol, but all are vulnerable to the null byte injection attack.
*   The advisory includes a detailed explanation of the protocol and how the attack works, including diagrams.
*   A tool has been designed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vendor, Phicomm, is defunct, meaning no official patches will be available.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a "**null byte interaction error**" that leads to predictable ephemeral passwords. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this, stating that a "**Null Byte Injection**" vulnerability exists because of insufficient validation and the use of `sprintf` with `%s`, which is vulnerable to null byte injection. This aligns directly with CWE-626, Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte), which is a Variant-level CWE. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-626 as the top match with a high combined score. The usage is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-626 doesn't have direct relationships listed in the provided information. However, the nature of the vulnerability suggests that it could be related to improper input validation or sanitization.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" indicates that the vulnerability involves an insecure backdoor (`telnetd_startup`) with a flawed cryptographic implementation. Although the primary weakness is the null byte injection, the fact that this leads to predictable passwords suggests that the system is using **hard-coded credentials** of some sort, as the injection makes those credentials easily guessable. CWE-798, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, is a Base-level CWE that applies here since the injected null byte effectively reduces the password to a very predictable value.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-798 is a parent of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key). Given that the issue manifests as a predictable password, CWE-798 is more appropriate as a general root cause, while the null byte injection is the mechanism by which this predictability is achieved.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (The vulnerability description suggests potential use of a hardcoded password. More information would be required to increase the confidence.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1391
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-344
ChildOf -> CWE-671
PeerOf -> CWE-257
ParentOf -> CWE-259
ParentOf -> CWE-321

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access



## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.

## CWE-626: Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly handle null bytes or NUL characters when passing data between different representations or components.

### Extended Description


A null byte (NUL character) can have different meanings across representations or languages. For example, it is a string terminator in standard C libraries, but Perl and PHP strings do not treat it as a terminator. When two representations are crossed - such as when Perl or PHP invokes underlying C functionality - this can produce an interaction error with unexpected results. Similar issues have been reported for ASP. Other interpreters written in C might also be affected.


The poison null byte is frequently useful in path traversal attacks by terminating hard-coded extensions that are added to a filename. It can play a role in regular expression processing in PHP.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Remove null bytes from all incoming strings.



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Current usage of "poison null byte" is typically related to this C/Perl/PHP interaction error, but the original term in 1998 was applied to an off-by-one buffer overflow involving a null byte.

**[Research Gap]** There are not many CVE examples, because the poison NULL byte is a design limitation, which typically is not included in CVE by itself. It is typically used as a facilitator manipulation to widen the scope of potential attacks against other vulnerabilities.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-4155:** NUL byte bypasses PHP regular expression check
- **CVE-2005-3153:** inserting SQL after a NUL byte bypasses allowlist regexp, enabling SQL injection



## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Prevention schemes mirror that of hard-coded password storage.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10.
