|---------|--------------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free     | 1.0        | Variant               | Primary                         | Allowed                           |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.4      | Variant               | Secondary                       | Allowed                           |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states a **use after free** in the Cast UI of Google Chrome. The 'CVE Reference Links Content Summary' section confirms that the root cause is a **use after free** vulnerability that leads to **heap corruption**. This directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free), which occurs when memory is reused after it has been freed. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top match with a high combined score and the usage is 'Allowed'."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Dead Memory). The 'CVE Reference Links Content Summary' indicates that exploitation could lead to remote code execution, and that the attacker would need to trigger the use-after-free condition. This may be caused by other weaknesses. The vulnerability description also mentions heap corruption, and CWE-416 could potentially lead to a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct evidence in the vulnerability description and reference links.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description mentions **heap corruption**, indicating a memory corruption issue. While the primary root cause is **use after free** (CWE-416), the heap corruption could also be a consequence of the use-after-free leading to a heap overflow. Although the description doesn't explicitly confirm a heap overflow, it can be considered as a secondary issue because the use-after-free can overwrite heap metadata, leading to heap corruption. This could potentially manifest as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It can be triggered by a use-after-free condition that corrupts the heap, eventually leading to out-of-bounds write. However, the primary cause is use-after-free, so CWE-122 is secondary."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.4 (Low confidence because it is not explicitly stated in the description. However, heap corruption is mentioned.)



## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
