  "query": "If an attacker is able to alter specific aboutconfig values (for example malware running on the users computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could have been enabled in a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed a remote attacker (able to make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor the users browsing activity and (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed by providing a visual cue when Devtools has an open network socket. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.",
