## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that "**Improper handling between export and release functions on the same handle from client** can lead to **use after free**". This directly aligns with CWE-416 (Use After Free), where memory is accessed after it has been freed. The **rootcause** is the "improper handling", and the **impact** is the "use after free". Since the vulnerability description directly mentions a "use after free" condition, CWE-416 is the most appropriate and specific mapping.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant-level CWE, indicating a specific type of memory management error.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description)
