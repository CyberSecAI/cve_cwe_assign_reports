## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a "**stack overflow**" bug. CWE-121, "Stack-based Buffer Overflow," is a direct match for this description. The vulnerability occurs in the SAML login feature, and the impact is a server crash caused by a maliciously crafted POST body. This aligns with the nature of a stack-based buffer overflow where excessive data written to the stack corrupts it, leading to a crash. While the description lacks specific details about the overflow mechanism (e.g., size calculation errors or missing bounds checks), the explicit mention of "stack overflow" makes CWE-121 the most appropriate primary classification.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also a parent of several more specific buffer overflow variants.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Direct mention of stack overflow, but lacks details on the root cause of the overflow)
