- **vector:** out of bounds write
- **product:** Android

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20382:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2022-20382 in the Pixel Update Bulletin, listing it as a moderate severity Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability affecting the Kernel. Additionally, the commit message from android.googlesource.com provides detailed information about the root cause and fix for the issue.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `incremental-fs` (incfs) filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `incfs_mount_fs()` function incorrectly handles multiple mount requests with the same source and target. The function allocates a new superblock for every mount call regardless if a mount already exists. This behavior deviates from standard filesystem mount implementations and leads to a recursive call for every mounted instance when a file operation like chmod, setxattr, or open is performed. This recursion causes a stack overflow, leading to a kernel crash.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect mount handling:** The `incfs_mount_fs()` function doesn't use the appropriate mount VFS calls (`mount_bdev()`, `mount_single()`, or `mount_nodev()`).
*   **Missing mount check:** The implementation fails to verify if a superblock for a mount instance has already been allocated.
*   **Stack overflow:** Recursive calls due to the incorrect mounting logic leads to a stack overflow and kernel crash

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service. Additionally, the EoP tag in the security bulletin suggests the possibility of privilege escalation. However, the provided text does not give specific information on how the EoP could be achieved.

**5. Attack vectors:**

An attacker can repeatedly mount an `incremental-fs` filesystem with the same source and target. Subsequently, they can trigger a file operation like `chmod`, `setxattr`, or `open` on the mounted filesystem, leading to the recursive call and eventual crash.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs the ability to mount filesystems and execute file operations. While the specifics are not mentioned, this vulnerability could be triggered by an attacker who has local access to the device with the ability to execute shell commands.

**Summary of extracted information:**
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-20382
*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of multiple mount requests with the same source and target in `incremental-fs`, leading to recursive calls.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing mount checks, incorrect VFS mount call usage, resulting in stack overflow.
*   **Impact:** Kernel crash (Denial of Service), potential Elevation of Privilege.
*   **Attack Vector:** Mounting `incremental-fs` multiple times with same source and target and then triggering file operation on it.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access to the device capable of mounting file systems and executing file operations.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-675 | Duplicate Operations on Resource | 0.85 | Base | Primary | The root cause is an incorrect implementation that leads to duplicate operations on the superblock, and ultimately a stack overflow. |
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | The stack overflow is a consequence of the recursive calls, but not the direct root cause. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is caused by the `incfs_mount_fs()` function incorrectly handling multiple mount requests, allocating a new superblock for each call, leading to recursive calls and a **kernel stack overflow**. The root cause of the issue isn't the stack overflow itself, but rather the logic that causes multiple operations to be performed on the same resource. This aligns with CWE-675 (Duplicate Operations on Resource). CWE-675 is a base level CWE. CWE-121 is included as a secondary issue, because the stack overflow itself is a consequence of the vulnerability, and it is a buffer overflow on the stack, but is not the best fit for the root cause.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-675 does not have defined parent/child relationships, but is a base CWE, suggesting it is a fundamental issue. CWE-121 is a type of buffer overflow, specifically on the stack.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence based on the detailed description of the root cause and the technical details provided in the CVE reference. The kernel stack overflow results from the **duplicate operations**.)

PeerOf -> CWE-586
PeerOf -> CWE-102
ParentOf -> CWE-1341
ParentOf -> CWE-174

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness is probably closely associated with other issues related to doubling, such as CWE-462 (duplicate key in alist) or CWE-102 (Struts duplicate validation forms). It's usually a case of an API contract violation (CWE-227).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2019-13351:** file descriptor double close can cause the wrong file to be associated with a file descriptor.

## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
