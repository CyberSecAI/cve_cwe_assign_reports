The application, after a successful login, sets the session cookie on the browser via client-side JavaScript code, without applying any security attributes (such as Secure, HttpOnly, or SameSite). Any attempts to browse the application via unencrypted HTTP protocol would lead to the transmission of all his/her session cookies in plaintext through the network. An attacker could then be able to sniff the network and capture sensitive information.",
