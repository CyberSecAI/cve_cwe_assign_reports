# Analysis for CVE-2021-21832

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves writing data past the end of an allocated buffer. |
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. An integer overflow leads to the allocation of a smaller than expected buffer. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that **a memory corruption vulnerability** exists due to **an out-of-bounds write** in Disc Soft Ltd Deamon Tools Pro 8.3.0.0767 when parsing a malformed ISO file. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides more detail: **An integer overflow** occurs when the size of a directory record is read, shifted left, and used for a `malloc` call. The shift operation can cause **an overflow**, resulting in a small buffer allocation. Subsequent writes to this small buffer result in a heap out-of-bounds write. This aligns precisely with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because data is written past the end of the allocated buffer. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is a contributing factor, as the integer overflow leads to the undersized buffer allocation, which then enables the out-of-bounds write. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which in turn can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to detailed technical description and CVE reference materials specifying integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write.)
