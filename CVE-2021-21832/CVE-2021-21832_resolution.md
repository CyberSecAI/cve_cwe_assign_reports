# Final Resolution for CVE-2021-21832

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves writing data past the end of an allocated buffer on the heap. |
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. An integer overflow during size calculation leads to the allocation of a smaller than expected buffer, enabling the out-of-bounds write. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Contributing CWE. An attacker-controlled value is used to calculate the buffer size without sufficient validation, allowing for an integer overflow. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, which is a child of **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**. The integer overflow, **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**, leads to an undersized buffer allocation that **CanPrecede** the out-of-bounds write. **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** is added to show the attacker-controlled input that leads to the overflow. This chain helps to clarify the vulnerability's progression.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)**, where the malformed ISO file provides an attacker-controlled size. This leads to **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** during the size calculation when the directory record size is read and shifted left. The overflow results in a smaller than expected buffer being allocated, which is then exploited by **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** when data is written past the end of the allocated buffer.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** and **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** as the primary and secondary **WEAKNESSES**. The criticism suggested adding **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** to complete the chain, which I agree with because the malformed ISO file is supplying a value (the size of the directory record) that is used in the calculation which overflows. This completes the chain from user-supplied input to memory corruption. The suggested addition of **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** as an additional information is not necessary, as **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** is sufficient, since **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** is more specific *variant* of the general out-of-bounds write. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with all being at the Base level of abstraction, as well as incorporating the addition of **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** from the suggested improvements.
