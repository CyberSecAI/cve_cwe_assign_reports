# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.60 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that users could **vote multiple times** in single-option polls due to a flaw in the Polls feature of Discourse. This directly aligns with CWE-837, "Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action," which describes a product that doesn't properly enforce the restriction that an actor should only be able to perform an action once. The action in this case is voting, and the uniqueness constraint is that a user should only vote once in a single-option poll. The **root cause** is insufficient input validation that allowed multiple votes. The impact of the vulnerability is the manipulation of poll results, which could mislead discussions within the Discourse platform. The fix implemented by Discourse included a SQL query that deletes older votes from a user exceeding the allowed number of votes and added validation for the min/max number of votes. CWE-837's Mapping Guidance indicates this is ALLOWED because the CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-837 does not have any listed direct relationships, it falls under the broader category of authorization and access control issues. It's related to the concept of ensuring actions are performed only once.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the clear match between the vulnerability description and CWE-837's characteristics)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The description also indicates a failure in authorization since the system allowed users to bypass the intended one-vote-per-user restriction. While CWE-837 is more specific, CWE-863, "Incorrect Authorization," could also be considered as a broader classification. However, CWE-837 provides a more precise representation of the weakness because it specifically addresses the issue of enforcing a single, unique action, whereas CWE-863 is more general. CWE-863 is listed as Allowed-with-Review because it is a Class CWE and might have Base-level children that are more appropriate, and in this case, CWE-837 is more appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-863 is a class-level CWE and represents a general category of authorization issues. It doesn't have specified relationships listed in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Medium confidence as CWE-837 provides a more specific classification)
