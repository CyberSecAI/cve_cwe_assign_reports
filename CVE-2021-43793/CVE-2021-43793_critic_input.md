## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Discourse's poll feature handles voting limits, specifically for single-option polls. The system failed to properly enforce the restriction that a user could only cast one vote on such polls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient input validation:** The core issue was a lack of proper validation of the number of votes a user could cast in a single-option poll. Despite the intention to limit users to one vote, the system was not enforcing this constraint.
- **Logic Error:** The code logic allowed users to bypass the intended one-vote-per-user restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing vote limits:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cast multiple votes in a single-option poll.
- **Manipulation of poll results:** By casting multiple votes, a user could skew poll results, potentially leading to inaccurate or manipulated outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct interaction with poll feature:** An attacker would interact with the poll feature directly through the user interface.
- **Repeated submission of votes:** The attacker would need to repeatedly submit votes for a single-option poll.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must be a registered user of the Discourse forum.
- **Access to poll:** The attacker needs access to a poll to cast votes.
- **No special privileges:** No elevated privileges or special access was required to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a commit ([1d0faed](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/1d0faedfbc3a8b77b971dc70d25e30791dbb6e0b)) that addresses the vulnerability. This commit introduces a SQL query that deletes older votes from a user once they have exceeded the allowed number of votes. It also adds validation for the min/max number of votes in the poll.
- The vulnerability was reported by JerryShah3 and ethicalbughunter.
- The fix was backported to the stable version of Discourse.
- The vulnerability was rated as "low severity."

In summary, CVE-2021-43793 is a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass voting limits in single-option polls on Discourse, leading to potential manipulation of poll results. The fix involved implementing proper validation and a mechanism for removing excess votes.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that users could **vote multiple times** in single-option polls due to a flaw in the Polls feature of Discourse. This directly aligns with CWE-837, "Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action," which describes a product that doesn't properly enforce the restriction that an actor should only be able to perform an action once. The action in this case is voting, and the uniqueness constraint is that a user should only vote once in a single-option poll. The **root cause** is insufficient input validation that allowed multiple votes. The impact of the vulnerability is the manipulation of poll results, which could mislead discussions within the Discourse platform. The fix implemented by Discourse included a SQL query that deletes older votes from a user exceeding the allowed number of votes and added validation for the min/max number of votes. CWE-837's Mapping Guidance indicates this is ALLOWED because the CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-837 does not have any listed direct relationships, it falls under the broader category of authorization and access control issues. It's related to the concept of ensuring actions are performed only once.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the clear match between the vulnerability description and CWE-837's characteristics)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The description also indicates a failure in authorization since the system allowed users to bypass the intended one-vote-per-user restriction. While CWE-837 is more specific, CWE-863, "Incorrect Authorization," could also be considered as a broader classification. However, CWE-837 provides a more precise representation of the weakness because it specifically addresses the issue of enforcing a single, unique action, whereas CWE-863 is more general. CWE-863 is listed as Allowed-with-Review because it is a Class CWE and might have Base-level children that are more appropriate, and in this case, CWE-837 is more appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-863 is a class-level CWE and represents a general category of authorization issues. It doesn't have specified relationships listed in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Medium confidence as CWE-837 provides a more specific classification)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-284
ParentOf -> CWE-1244
ParentOf -> CWE-551
ParentOf -> CWE-639
ParentOf -> CWE-647
ParentOf -> CWE-804
ParentOf -> CWE-942

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the product into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. Use role-based access control (RBAC) [REF-229] to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.


Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that access control checks are performed related to the business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that are applied to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor [REF-7].

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].




### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.



## CWE-837: Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product requires that an actor should only be able to perform an action once, or to have only one unique action, but the product does not enforce or improperly enforces this restriction.

### Extended Description
In various applications, a user is only expected to perform a certain action once, such as voting, requesting a refund, or making a purchase. When this restriction is not enforced, sometimes this can have security implications. For example, in a voting application, an attacker could attempt to "stuff the ballot box" by voting multiple times. If these votes are counted separately, then the attacker could directly affect who wins the vote. This could have significant business impact depending on the purpose of the product.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-799

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-0294:** Ticket-booking web application allows a user to lock a seat more than once.
- **CVE-2005-4051:** CMS allows people to rate downloads by voting more than once.
- **CVE-2002-216:** Polling software allows people to vote more than once by setting a cookie.
