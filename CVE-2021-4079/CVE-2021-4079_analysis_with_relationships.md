# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-4079 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**out of bounds write**" in WebRTC leading to "**heap corruption**". This directly aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), where data is written past the end of the intended buffer. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds write** in WebRTC. Given that the **heap corruption** is mentioned, CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) which is a variant of buffer overflow can be considered as a secondary weakness. The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-787 with a high score, further supporting this classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates this is ALLOWED for out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-122 is also a child of CWE-119. The relationship graph shows CWE-787 CanFollow CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) or CWE-824 (Missing Initialization). It can also CanPrecede itself.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the clear description of the **out of bounds write** and the support from CVE reference and retriever results.)
