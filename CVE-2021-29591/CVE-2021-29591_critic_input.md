# Critic Input for CVE-2021-29591



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TFlite graphs must not have **loops between nodes**. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by **stack overflow** due to too many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc) could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) graphs, specifically regarding loops between nodes. The `While` operator in TFLite could be exploited by creating a scenario where the condition and body subgraphs are the same. This would lead to an infinite loop or stack overflow during model evaluation due to recursive calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing loop detection**: TFLite did not check for loops in the graph structure.
- **Recursive calls without limits**: The `While` operator could be tricked into recursively calling itself, exhausting the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Infinite loop:** A specially crafted model could cause an infinite loop during evaluation.
- **Stack overflow:** Recursive calls from the infinite loop could lead to stack exhaustion and a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted TFLite model:** An attacker could create a malicious TFLite model with a looped graph structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create and provide a crafted TFLite model.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically impacts the TFLite interpreter when evaluating models with loops.
- The fix involves adding checks for recursion and ensuring that subgraphs are not used recursively.
- The commits fixing the issue are  [9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743) (for the `While` operator) and  [c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4) (in general).
- The vulnerability is addressed in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2 and will be included in 2.5.0.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary weakness described is the potential for **infinite loops** in TFlite graphs due to a lack of validation for **loops between nodes**. This directly corresponds to CWE-835, Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'). The vulnerability description states, "TFlite graphs must not have **loops between nodes**. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation." This clearly indicates a missing check for a condition that leads to an infinite loop. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by highlighting the **missing loop detection** as a key weakness. CWE-835 is a Base level CWE and the mapping guidance indicates it is ALLOWED.

  - In some cases, the **infinite loop** leads to **stack overflow** due to excessive recursive calls. This suggests CWE-674, Improper Control of Recursion Depth, as a secondary weakness. The description mentions the `While` implementation could be tricked into a scenario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same, leading to the `Eval` function calling itself recursively and exhausting stack space. CWE-674 is a Class level CWE, and while a more specific child CWE might be ideal, the available information doesn't pinpoint a precise variant. The mapping guidance is ALLOWED-with-Review, suggesting caution, but appropriate given the context.

  - Finally, an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125) could be caused during the execution of a crafted model, potentially as a result of the **infinite loop**. However, this is a less direct consequence compared to the **infinite loop** itself and the **stack overflow**, so it's a weaker candidate.

- **Relationship Analysis:**
  - CWE-835 describes an **infinite loop**.
  - CWE-674 can result from the unchecked looping and recursive calls.
  - CWE-835 CanPrecede CWE-1322 (Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context). This relationship is relevant as the crafted model with the loop will block until the **stack overflow** condition is met.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence for CWE-835 due to direct match with **infinite loop** condition.)
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence for CWE-674 due to the connection between **infinite loop** and resulting **stack overflow**.)
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Low confidence for CWE-125 as a potential consequence, but not directly stated.)

## CWE-1322: Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a non-blocking model that relies on a single threaded process
			for features such as scalability, but it contains code that can block when it is invoked.

### Extended Description


When an attacker can directly invoke the blocking code, or the blocking code can be affected by environmental conditions that can be influenced by an attacker, then this can lead to a denial of service by causing unexpected hang or freeze of the code. Examples of blocking code might be an expensive computation or calling blocking library calls, such as those that perform exclusive file operations or require a successful network operation.


Due to limitations in multi-thread models, single-threaded models are used to overcome the resource constraints that are caused by using many threads. In such a model, all code should generally be non-blocking. If blocking code is called, then the event loop will effectively be stopped, which can be undesirable or dangerous. Such models are used in Python asyncio, Vert.x, and Node.js, or other custom event loop code.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834
CanPrecede -> CWE-835

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Generally speaking, blocking calls should be replaced with non-blocking alternatives that can be used asynchronously. Expensive computations should be passed off to worker threads, although the correct approach depends on the framework being used.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** For expensive computations, consider breaking them up into multiple smaller computations. Refer to the documentation of the framework being used for guidance.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834
ParentOf -> CWE-776

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Ensure an end condition will be reached under all logic conditions. The end condition may include testing against the depth of recursion and exiting with an error if the recursion goes too deep. The complexity of the end condition contributes to the effectiveness of this action.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Description:** Increase the stack size.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.
