# Critic Input for CVE-2021-21381



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. In Flatpack since version 0.9.4 and before version 1.10.2 has a vulnerability in the file forwarding feature which can be used by an attacker to gain access to files that would not ordinarily be allowed by the apps permissions. By putting the special tokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the Exec field of a Flatpak apps .desktop file, a malicious app publisher can trick flatpak into behaving as though the user had chosen to open a target file with their Flatpak app, which automatically makes that file available to the Flatpak app. This is fixed in version 1.10.2. A minimal solution is the first commit `Disallow @@ and @@U usage in desktop files`. The follow-up commits `dir Reserve the whole @@ prefix` and `dir Refuse to export .desktop files with suspicious uses of @@ tokens` are recommended, but not strictly required. As a workaround, avoid installing Flatpak apps from untrusted sources, or check the contents of the exported `.desktop` files in `exports/share/applications/*.desktop` (typically `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop` and `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop`) to make sure that literal filenames do not follow `@@` or `@@u`.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **vulnerability in file forwarding feature**
- **impact:** gain access to unauthorized files
- **vector:** special tokens @@ and @@u
- **attacker:** malicious app publisher
- **product:** Flatpak
- **version:** 0.9.4 to 1.10.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Flatpak handles the `Exec` field in `.desktop` files, specifically how it processes special tokens related to file forwarding (`%F`, `%f`, `%U`, `%u`). Flatpak uses `@@` and `@@u` to encapsulate file arguments, which are then passed to the sandboxed application. However, it did not properly validate additional arguments, allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary file paths within these special tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Flatpak failed to validate additional arguments in the `Exec` field, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary file paths encapsulated within `@@` tokens.
-   **File Forwarding Bypass:** The vulnerability abuses the intended "file forwarding" feature of Flatpak, which is meant to give sandboxed applications access to files a user has explicitly opened with it, but the vulnerability makes this access available to files not intended by the user.
-   **Sandbox Escape:** By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can cause the Flatpak application to gain access to files outside of its sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can craft a malicious `.desktop` file that forces a Flatpak application to read arbitrary files from the host system (as seen in the PoC with `/etc/passwd`).
-   **Privilege Escalation**: While not a direct privilege escalation to root, an attacker can use this to obtain sensitive information, bypass file access restrictions, potentially leading to further compromise of user data or the system through other vulnerabilities.
-   **Malicious Application:** This vulnerability allows malicious app publishers to create apps that read user-accessible files outside of the sandbox.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious `.desktop` File:** The primary attack vector is via a specially crafted `.desktop` file. This file is installed when a Flatpak application is installed.
-   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability. It can be exploited by any user who can install a malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Publish Flatpak Applications:** An attacker needs to be able to publish a malicious Flatpak application that includes a crafted `.desktop` file that contains the malicious payload.
-   **User Installation:** A user must install the malicious Flatpak application.

**Mitigation:**

-   **Input Sanitization:**  The vulnerability was addressed by disallowing `@@` and `@@u` tokens in the desktop file. Additionally, the entire `@@` prefix was reserved to avoid similar issues in the future. Finally, Flatpak will refuse to export any `.desktop` files containing these tokens, which will prevent the installation of malicious applications.
-   **Upgrade:** Updating Flatpak to version 1.10.2 or later, or a backported version containing the patch will mitigate the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was assigned the CVE ID CVE-2021-21381.
- It was also assigned the Github Security Advisory GHSA-xgh4-387p-hqpp.
- Fixes were made to flatpak versions 1.10.2 and also backported to 1.8.x.
- Several downstream distributions like Debian and Fedora issued security advisories and updates for this issue.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability allows a malicious app publisher to **gain access to files that would not ordinarily be allowed** by the app's permissions. The attack uses special tokens `@@` and `@@u` in the `Exec` field of a Flatpak app's .desktop file to **trick flatpak into behaving as though the user had chosen to open a target file** with the app. This represents an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184) because Flatpak is not properly validating the arguments within the `Exec` field, allowing arbitrary file paths. Additionally, the ability to access arbitrary files can be considered a form of **Path Traversal** (CWE-22).
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-184 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate. CWE-22 is related because the attacker is effectively traversing the file system to access unintended files.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence as the description focuses more on the bypass of file forwarding than strict path traversal, giving precedence to CWE-184). Confidence: 0.60 (Medium evidence as the attack is about accessing files outside of the intended permissions, which is similar to path traversal).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves the **file forwarding feature** of Flatpak. By using the special tokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the `Exec` field of a Flatpak app's .desktop file, an attacker can trick Flatpak into providing access to files that the app should not have access to. This can be seen as a form of **incomplete input validation** where Flatpak fails to properly sanitize or restrict the file paths specified through these tokens. The core issue is that the list of disallowed or properly handled inputs (file paths) is incomplete. This aligns well with CWE-184, which describes a protection mechanism relying on a list of disallowed inputs that is incomplete.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* The Retriever results indicate that CWE-184 is a strong candidate. It is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. The mapping guidance for CWE-184 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence, as the primary mechanism described is related to bypassing intended restrictions through incomplete input validation related to file access).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* While the primary weakness is the incomplete list of disallowed inputs, the vulnerability also has elements of **path traversal**. By manipulating the `Exec` field with `@@` and `@@u` tokens, an attacker can potentially specify paths that lead outside the intended directory or file access scope of the application. This aligns with CWE-22, where external input is used to construct a pathname that is not properly restricted to a parent directory.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* The Retriever results list CWE-22 as a candidate, although with a lower score than CWE-184. It is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate. The mapping guidance for CWE-22 indicates that it is ALLOWED. However, the evidence primarily points to bypassing intended file access restrictions, making CWE-184 more directly relevant.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Medium evidence, as the path traversal aspect is a secondary consequence of the primary weakness).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Denylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.
Blocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Blacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
ChildOf -> CWE-1023
CanPrecede -> CWE-79
CanPrecede -> CWE-78
CanPrecede -> CWE-434
CanPrecede -> CWE-98
ParentOf -> CWE-692

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Do not rely exclusively on detecting disallowed inputs. There are too many variants to encode a character, especially when different environments are used, so there is a high likelihood of missing some variants. Only use detection of disallowed inputs as a mechanism for detecting suspicious activity. Ensure that you are using other protection mechanisms that only identify "good" input - such as lists of allowed inputs - and ensure that you are properly encoding your outputs.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning
- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".



## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668
CanFollow -> CWE-172
CanFollow -> CWE-20
ParentOf -> CWE-23
ParentOf -> CWE-36

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.


Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.


Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes ".." sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). This includes:


  - realpath() in C

  - getCanonicalPath() in Java

  - GetFullPath() in ASP.NET

  - realpath() or abs_path() in Perl

  - realpath() in PHP





### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.
