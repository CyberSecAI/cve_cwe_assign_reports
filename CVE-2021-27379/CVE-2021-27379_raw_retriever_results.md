# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-27379

## Query
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to achieve unintended read/write DMA access, and possibly cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or gain privileges. This occurs because a backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct. NOTE this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-15565.

## Keyphrases
