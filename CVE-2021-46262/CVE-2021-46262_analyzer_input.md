## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `/goform/setWAN` page of Tenda Router AC series devices. Specifically, it occurs within the `PPPoE` module when handling the `wanPPPoEUser` input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of proper length checks when reading the `wanPPPoEUser` input into the `v16` variable.
- The program uses `nvram_set` to store the oversized user input `wan0_pppoe_username` without proper length validation.
- Subsequent use of `nvram_get` to copy the user-controlled, over-sized content into the stack variable `v63` and then copied to a destination at `0x804948B5`, leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) attack can be triggered.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible with carefully crafted overflow data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/setWAN` page.
- The attack vector involves manipulating the `wanPPPoEUser` parameter in the POST request to provide an overly long string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable router's web interface.
- The attacker has to know or be able to guess the endpoint and required parameter `wanPPPoEUser`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects at least Tenda Router AC11 with firmware version AC11_V02.03.01.104_CN
- The provided images illustrate the vulnerable code flow and the location where overflow occurs.
- This vulnerability was reported to CVE and CNVD, receiving the IDs CNVD-2022-08889 and CVE-2021-46262 respectively.
