# Critic Input for CVE-2021-43114



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
FORT Validator versions prior to 1.5.2 will crash if an RPKI CA publishes an X.509 EE certificate. This will lead to RTR clients such as BGP routers to lose access to the RPKI VRP data set, effectively disabling Route Origin Validation.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** crash
- **vector:** X.509 EE certificate
- **attacker:** RPKI CA
- **product:** FORT Validator
- **version:** prior to 1.5.2

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that the FORT Validator crashes due to improper handling of X.509 EE certificates published by an RPKI CA. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the **root cause** stems from **improper handling of certificate data** and a **lack of proper validation** during RPKI validation. This aligns with CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation), which describes a product that does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate. This is the primary weakness because the core issue is the incorrect validation of certificates. The impact is a crash leading to a denial-of-service. The "Retriever Results" identify CWE-295 as a potential match with a high score, further supporting this classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-295 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-295 is a Base level CWE. There aren't any direct parent-child relationships listed.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1288 (Improper Validation of Consistency within Input) is also a candidate because the input certificates are complex and need to be consistent. The lack of validation of the certificates is causing the crash. However, since the core issue revolves around the malformed certificates, it's more of an effect of the root cause and not the main weakness, but it is worth noting. It's a secondary factor contributing to the vulnerability, especially considering the description mentions improper handling of certificate data and a lack of proper validation.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no relationships to other CWEs listed.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Sufficient evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-287
PeerOf -> CWE-322
ParentOf -> CWE-296
ParentOf -> CWE-297
ParentOf -> CWE-298
ParentOf -> CWE-299
ParentOf -> CWE-599

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Certificates should be carefully managed and checked to assure that data are encrypted with the intended owner's public key.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the hostname.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.
- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug).

- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).



## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.

### Extended Description


Some input data can be structured with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, e.g. a number-of-items field that is followed by the expected number of elements. When such complex inputs are inconsistent, attackers could trigger unexpected errors, cause incorrect actions to take place, or exploit latent vulnerabilities.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-16733:** product does not validate that the start block appears before the end block
- **CVE-2006-3790:** size field that is inconsistent with packet size leads to buffer over-read
- **CVE-2008-4114:** system crash with offset value that is inconsistent with packet size
