# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-26307

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-331 | Insufficient Entropy | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | The **master key was poorly encoded** resulting in weakening its entropy, which directly aligns with CWE-331. |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | The stored passwords, while encrypted, are **vulnerable to brute force attack** due to the weakened master key. This implies a failure to adequately protect sensitive information at rest. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The primary weakness identified is **insufficient entropy** (CWE-331) in the master key encoding, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **master key was poorly encoded**, resulting in a reduction of its entropy from 128 to 43 bits. This matches the description of CWE-331, where an algorithm produces insufficient entropy, leading to predictable or clustered values."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-331, by itself, doesn't have direct relationships to other cryptographic weaknesses. However, in the context of this vulnerability, the insufficient entropy directly leads to a weakened encryption scheme, which has implications for the confidentiality of stored passwords. The brute force attack is facilitated by the low entropy of the master key, directly exploiting the weakness."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary explicitly mentioning the weakened entropy of the master key).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a secondary consideration. The passwords are not stored in cleartext, but the encryption is so weak that it is practically equivalent to storing them in a vulnerable manner. The vulnerability description key phrases note that the **master key was poorly encoded** and the **impact** is that the stored passwords are **vulnerable to a brute force attack**. The CVE reference summary confirms that the stored passwords are encrypted using a weakened master key. This aligns with CWE-312's concept of storing sensitive information in a way that is easily accessible due to inadequate protection."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-312 has parent-child relationships with other CWEs related to data storage. While not a direct parent or child, the vulnerability can be seen as related to the broader category of improper data protection. The key aspect is the insufficient protection, making the stored data effectively exposed."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence as the primary weakness is the entropy issue, but the resulting vulnerability exposes stored credentials.)



## Known Examples for CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0950** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0950](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0950): Insufficiently random data used to generate session tokens using C rand(). Also, for certificate/key generation, uses a source that does not block when entropy is low.
- **CVE-2008-2108** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2108](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2108): Chain: insufficient precision (CWE-1339) in random-number generator causes some zero bits to be reliably generated, reducing the amount of entropy (CWE-331)
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-31798**: The effective key space used to encrypt the cache in CyberArk Credential Provider prior to 12.1 has low entropy, and under certain conditions a local malicious user can obtain the plaintext of cache files.
- **CVE-2021-36320**: Dell Networking X-Series firmware versions prior to 3.0.1.8 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker may potentially hijack a session and access the webserver by forging the session ID.
- **CVE-2021-21955**: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the get_aes_key_info_by_packetid() function of the home_security binary of Anker Eufy Homebase 2 2.1.6.9h. Generic network sniffing can lead to password recovery. An attacker can sniff network traffic to trigger this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2021-36294**: Dell VNX2 OE for File versions 8.1.21.266 and earlier, contain an authentication bypass vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker may exploit this vulnerability by forging a cookie to login as any user.
- **CVE-2021-22799**: A CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy vulnerability exists that could cause unintended connection from an internal network to an external network when an attacker manages to decrypt the SESU proxy password from the registry. Affected Product: Schneider Electric Software Update, V2.3.0 through V2.5.1
- **CVE-2021-42138**: A user of a machine protected by SafeNet Agent for Windows Logon may leverage weak entropy to access the encrypted credentials of any or all the users on that machine.
- **CVE-2022-34294**: totd 1.5.3 uses a fixed UDP source port in upstream queries sent to DNS resolvers. This allows DNS cache poisoning because there is not enough entropy to prevent traffic injection attacks.
- **CVE-2022-37401**: Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user's configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulnerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects: Apache OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13. Reference: CVE-2022-26307 - LibreOffice
