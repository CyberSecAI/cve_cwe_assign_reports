# Analysis for CVE-2022-26307

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-331 | Insufficient Entropy | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | The **master key was poorly encoded** resulting in weakening its entropy, which directly aligns with CWE-331. |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | The stored passwords, while encrypted, are **vulnerable to brute force attack** due to the weakened master key. This implies a failure to adequately protect sensitive information at rest. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The primary weakness identified is **insufficient entropy** (CWE-331) in the master key encoding, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **master key was poorly encoded**, resulting in a reduction of its entropy from 128 to 43 bits. This matches the description of CWE-331, where an algorithm produces insufficient entropy, leading to predictable or clustered values."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-331, by itself, doesn't have direct relationships to other cryptographic weaknesses. However, in the context of this vulnerability, the insufficient entropy directly leads to a weakened encryption scheme, which has implications for the confidentiality of stored passwords. The brute force attack is facilitated by the low entropy of the master key, directly exploiting the weakness."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary explicitly mentioning the weakened entropy of the master key).

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a secondary consideration. The passwords are not stored in cleartext, but the encryption is so weak that it is practically equivalent to storing them in a vulnerable manner. The vulnerability description key phrases note that the **master key was poorly encoded** and the **impact** is that the stored passwords are **vulnerable to a brute force attack**. The CVE reference summary confirms that the stored passwords are encrypted using a weakened master key. This aligns with CWE-312's concept of storing sensitive information in a way that is easily accessible due to inadequate protection."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-312 has parent-child relationships with other CWEs related to data storage. While not a direct parent or child, the vulnerability can be seen as related to the broader category of improper data protection. The key aspect is the insufficient protection, making the stored data effectively exposed."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence as the primary weakness is the entropy issue, but the resulting vulnerability exposes stored credentials.)
