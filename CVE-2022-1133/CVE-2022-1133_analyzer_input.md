## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1133

**Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in WebRTC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes and potential arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity and could potentially lead to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:** The specific attack vector isn't detailed beyond being related to WebRTC, implying a network-based attack through the WebRTC interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need the ability to interact with a vulnerable application that utilizes WebRTC. The specific method of triggering the vulnerability is not specified but given the use-after-free, it is likely to involve some degree of manipulation of data or flow control in WebRTC.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as QtWebEngine.
- The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 202208-25) lists specific affected and unaffected versions for each package.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher.
- A fix was included in Chrome 100.0.4896.60 and corresponding updates for other affected software.
