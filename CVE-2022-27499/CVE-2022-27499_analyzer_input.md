# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-27499

## Vulnerability Description
Premature release of resource during expected lifetime in the Intel(R) SGX SDK software may allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **premature release of resource during expected lifetime**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **vector:** local access
- **attacker:** privileged user
- **product:** Intel(R) SGX SDK

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Premature release of a resource during its expected lifetime within the Intel SGX SDK software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper resource management in the SGX SDK. Specifically, a resource is released too early.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure. A privileged user can potentially gain access to sensitive information due to the premature resource release.
