# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-27499

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-826 | Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The description explicitly states "premature release of resource during expected lifetime". |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: Premature release could potentially lead to sensitive information being leaked. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **premature release of a resource during its expected lifetime**. This directly corresponds to CWE-826 (Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime). The **rootcause** identified in the vulnerability description, **premature release of resource during expected lifetime**, is a direct match. The impact is information disclosure, which is a common consequence of prematurely releasing resources.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-826 does not have any direct parent-child relationships according to the provided information. While CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release) is a Class that includes resource release issues, CWE-826 is more specific about the timing of the release, making it a better fit.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-826 definition).

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The impact of the **premature release** is stated to be a potential information disclosure. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) could be applicable if the **premature release** allows access to or leakage of sensitive data.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and a parent of CWE-598 (Use of GET Request Method for Credentials). It is related to information exposure scenarios. If the **premature release** directly leads to the exposure of sensitive information, CWE-201 might be a secondary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Medium confidence. This is a possible secondary effect, but more information is needed to confirm that sensitive data is actually being inserted into sent data due to the premature release).



## Known Examples for CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708): Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24226**: In the AccessAlly WordPress plugin before 3.5.7, the file "resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php" responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode is dumping serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.
- **CVE-2021-33687**: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.
- **CVE-2021-3509**: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **CVE-2021-34771**: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.
- **CVE-2021-25122**: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.
- **CVE-2021-0644**: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462
- **CVE-2020-11922**: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
- **CVE-2021-24170**: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.
- **CVE-2021-24585**: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id
