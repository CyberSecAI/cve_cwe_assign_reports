# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-35896

## Vulnerability Description
An issue SMM memory leak vulnerability in SMM driver (SMRAM was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. An attacker can dump SMRAM contents via the software SMI provided by the FvbServicesRuntimeDxe driver to read the contents of SMRAM, leading to information disclosure.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Insyde InsydeH2O
- **version:** kernel 5.0 through 5.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-35896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an SMM memory leak in the `FvbServicesRuntimeDxe` driver of InsydeH2O UEFI firmware.
- Specifically, the `SmfbFunc1` function within the `FwBlockServiceSmm` SMM driver allows an attacker to read arbitrary SMRAM memory due to a lack of input validation on the address argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SMM Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is that the `SmfbFunc1` function allows reading from arbitrary memory locations within SMRAM.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `addr` argument passed to `SmfbFunc1` is not validated, allowing an attacker to supply an address within SMRAM.
- **Memory Copy:** The vulnerable function uses either `memcpy` or `sub_800031CC` to copy memory from the attacker-specified SMRAM address to a destination buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive information stored in SMRAM. This could reveal secrets, code, or other data that can be leveraged in subsequent attacks.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By reading SMRAM, an attacker can gain knowledge about SMM internals, which can be used to exploit SMM memory corruption vulnerabilities and gain control of the SMM environment (Ring -2).
- **Firmware Backdoor/Implant:** The attacker could use this vulnerability to bypass SMM-based SPI flash protections and install a firmware backdoor or implant into the BIOS, which could persist across operating system re-installs.
- **Bypass Security Mechanisms:** The vulnerability can potentially be used to bypass UEFI firmware security mechanisms like Secure Boot and memory isolation for hypervisors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific command (where `*((_DWORD *)CommBuffer + 6) = 0`) through the registered SMI handler.
- The attacker controls the `addr` argument (`*((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 2)`) which is used in `memcpy` or `sub_800031CC` function, allowing access to SMRAM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the SMI handler, which typically requires high privileges (ring 0).
- **Runtime Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited from the runtime environment, implying the attacker needs to be able to execute code within the operating system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Binarly efiXplorer team.
- Affected InsydeH2O versions and fixes are provided in the Insyde advisory.
- Binarly assigned the internal identifier BRLY-2022-025 to this vulnerability and provided a FwHunt rule for detection.
- The issue was reported to Insyde PSIRT, which assigned the CVE number.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to leak information from SMM memory, which could be used to launch further, more severe attacks against the system.
