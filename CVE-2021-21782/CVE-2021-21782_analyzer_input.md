## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that relates to CVE-2021-21782.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of buffer size when parsing SGI files within the Accusoft ImageGear library. The size parameter for memory allocation is taken directly from the SGI header's XSIZE value, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking when allocating memory for processing SGI files. By controlling the SGI header's XSIZE, the attacker can force the allocation of a zero-sized buffer. Additionally, the size parameter of a subsequent memcpy operation is taken from attacker-controlled data from the SGI file. When the allocated buffer is smaller than the data being copied into it, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to heap memory corruption and can potentially result in arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted, malformed SGI file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious SGI file to the vulnerable application (Accusoft ImageGear). No special privileges or position are mentioned.
