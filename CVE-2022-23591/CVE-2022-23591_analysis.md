# Analysis for CVE-2022-23591

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Improper Control of Recursion | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that a `GraphDef` containing a self-recursive function can cause a **stack overflow** during execution in TensorFlow. This aligns directly with CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion), which describes a situation where a product does not properly control the amount of recursion, leading to excessive resource consumption. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause is the lack of validation for self-recursive functions within the `GraphDef` format. CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be Base-level children that are more appropriate. However, without more information about the specific mechanism of the recursion, CWE-674 is the most appropriate high-level classification.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships for CWE-674 in the provided data. However, stack overflows are a classic symptom of uncontrolled recursion.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
