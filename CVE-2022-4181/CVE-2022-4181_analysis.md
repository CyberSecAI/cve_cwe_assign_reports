## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the root cause. It also identifies "**heap corruption**" as the weakness, resulting from accessing memory after it has been freed. This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes the scenario where a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms "**Use after free**" as the root_cause and a weakness. CWE-416 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. The MITRE mapping guidance states that the usage of CWE-416 is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). While CWE-672 is a broader category, CWE-416 specifically addresses the 'Use After Free' condition.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The description explicitly names "Use after free".)
