# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-4203

## Vulnerability Description
A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-4203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type confusion in the `nc_match_single()` function within OpenSSL's X.509 name constraint checking implementation.
*   The function incorrectly assumes that if a `gen` (General Name) is an OtherName, then the `base` (base constraint) is always an `rfc822Name` constraint. This assumption is not always valid.
*   Specifically, if an end-entity certificate contains an OtherName SAN (Subject Alternative Name) of any type besides `SmtpUtf8Mailbox`, and the CA certificate contains a name constraint of OtherName (of any type), then `nc_email_eai` is invoked. This function incorrectly interprets the `base` OTHERNAME as an `ASN1_IA5STRING`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify the type of the `base` parameter, leading to a misinterpretation of the data it holds.
*   **Read Buffer Overrun:** The type confusion leads to a read buffer overrun during X.509 certificate verification, specifically during name constraint checking. The `nc_email_eai` function attempts to read data from an address as if it were an ASN1_IA5STRING, when it is an arbitrary data that depends on the othername type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The read buffer overrun can result in a crash, which could lead to a denial of service attack.
*   **Potential Memory Disclosure:** Although not confirmed with a working exploit at the time of advisory release, there is a theoretical possibility of disclosing private memory contents (e.g., private keys or sensitive plaintext) due to the memory corruption caused by the buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **TLS Client:** A malicious server can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted certificate to a vulnerable TLS client during connection establishment.
*   **TLS Server:** A malicious client can trigger the vulnerability by connecting to a vulnerable TLS server that requests client authentication and providing a malicious certificate.
*  **Other scenarios** The vulnerability could also be triggered in scenarios that do not involve TLS if a certificate verification is performed with a vulnerable openssl version and a malformed certificate that triggers the type confusion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to present a malicious certificate to a vulnerable OpenSSL instance.
*   For a TLS client, the attacker needs to control the server the client connects to. For a TLS server, the attacker needs to be a client connecting to the server.
*   The malicious certificate needs to have specific properties: it must contain an OtherName SAN that is not `SmtpUtf8Mailbox`, and it must be checked against a CA certificate that has an OtherName type name constraint.
*   The attack occurs after the certificate chain signature verification, so the attacker's certificate needs to be signed by a CA or the application needs to continue the certificate verification despite not having a valid chain to a trusted issuer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to be of "Moderate" severity by OpenSSL but rated as "Critical" by GitHub.
*   The vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.7. Versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.
*   The fix involves correcting the type handling in the `nc_match_single` function.
*   The Gentoo security advisory indicates that OpenSSL versions prior to 3.0.10 are vulnerable.
*   The GitHub advisory for the `openssl-src` crate states that versions >=300.0.0 and <300.0.12 are affected.

In summary, CVE-2022-4203 is a type confusion vulnerability in OpenSSL's name constraint checking, which can lead to a read buffer overrun and potential DoS or memory disclosure. It can be exploited by a malicious server or client with a crafted certificate during TLS connections, or in other scenarios where certificate verification is performed, with a vulnerable openssl library.
