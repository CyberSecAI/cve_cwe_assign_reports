## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **read buffer overrun** can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification. The **rootcause** is a **buffer underflow**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, highlighting a **type confusion** in the `nc_match_single()` function leading to a **read buffer overrun**. The function incorrectly assumes the type of the `base` parameter, resulting in the `nc_email_eai` function attempting to read data from an address as if it were an `ASN1_IA5STRING`, when it is an arbitrary data, depending on the othername type. This directly aligns with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which describes a product reading data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-125 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a Base level CWE. While there are more specific variants like CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), the description doesn't limit the read to just "after the targeted buffer." The description mentions the read could occur due to type confusion, which means CWE-843 (Type Confusion) is also a contributing weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "read buffer overrun" and detailed technical explanation in CVE reference).

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates a **type confusion** in the `nc_match_single()` function. The function incorrectly assumes that if a `gen` (General Name) is an OtherName, then the `base` (base constraint) is always an `rfc822Name` constraint. This aligns with CWE-843 (Type Confusion), which states: "The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type." The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-843 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-843 is a Base level CWE. It contributes to the root cause, but the direct impact is the out-of-bounds read.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence, as type confusion is a prerequisite to the buffer overrun, but is not the direct cause of DoS).



## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
