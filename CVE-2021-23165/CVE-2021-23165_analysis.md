# Analysis for CVE-2021-23165

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability leads to writing data past the end of the intended buffer. |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed |  Secondary CWE. The **heap buffer overflow** occurs because the buffer is allocated on the heap. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **heap buffer overflow** in `pspdf_prepare_outpages()` in `ps-pdf.cxx`. The CVE description indicates a missing boundary check in the `pspdf_prepare_outpages()` function when handling number-up page configurations. This directly corresponds to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because the **heap buffer overflow** allows writing data past the intended buffer. Since the buffer is allocated on the heap, CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is also applicable and provides more specific information about the location of the buffer. The primary weakness is writing out of bounds (CWE-787) which causes the overflow.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE and a parent of CWE-122. CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence in the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)
