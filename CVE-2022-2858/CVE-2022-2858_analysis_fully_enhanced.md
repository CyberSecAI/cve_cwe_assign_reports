# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Use after free** in Sign-In Flow". This perfectly matches the description of CWE-416, "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed." The CVE reference links further confirm this, stating the **root_cause** and **weaknesses** as "**Use after free**". The impact described, "heap corruption," is a common consequence of use-after-free vulnerabilities. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-416 doesn't have direct relationships listed that are immediately applicable, it's often a consequence of other weaknesses. It can be triggered by race conditions (like CWE-362) or improper resource management. However, without more information pinpointing the prerequisite weakness, focusing on the direct cause (CWE-416) is appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "use after free" in the vulnerability description and CVE details)
