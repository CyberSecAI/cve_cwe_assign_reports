# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-37452

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-313 | Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves storing login information in **cleartext** within `.dat` configuration files, allowing local users to discover this information by reading the files. This directly aligns with CWE-256, "Plaintext Storage of a Password" and CWE-313, "Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk". The CVE reference summary explicitly states that "Passwords and other sensitive user data are stored without any encryption or hashing." CWE-256 is a more specific match, since the primary **weakness** is the **storage of passwords in plaintext**. CWE-313 is related because it is about storing sensitive information in cleartext to a file or on disk, but the passwords are the primary concern. The MITRE mapping guidance for both CWE-256 and CWE-313 indicates they are ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-256 is a base CWE, and per the description, storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise. CWE-313 is a variant CWE, and is a child of CWE-312 "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of plaintext password storage in the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

## Known Examples for CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30275](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30275): Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1126**: A vulnerability in the storage of proxy server credentials of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view credentials for a configured proxy server. The vulnerability is due to clear-text storage and weak permissions of related configuration files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of the affected software and viewing the contents of the affected files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials that are used to access the proxy server.
- **CVE-2021-41023**: A unprotected storage of credentials in Fortinet FortiSIEM Windows Agent version 4.1.4 and below allows an authenticated user to disclosure agent password due to plaintext credential storage in log files
- **CVE-2021-1589**: A vulnerability in the disaster recovery feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials. This vulnerability exists because access to API endpoints is not properly restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials that could be used in further attacks.
- **CVE-2021-41297**: ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to weak access control mechanism allowing authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.
- **CVE-2021-21590**: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.
- **CVE-2021-21591**: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.
- **CVE-2021-36309**: Dell Enterprise SONiC OS, versions 3.3.0 and earlier, contains a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. An authenticated malicious user with access to the system may use the TACACS\\Radius credentials stored to read sensitive information and use it in further attacks.
- **CVE-2021-23207**: An attacker with physical access to the host can extract the secrets from the registry and create valid JWT tokens for the Fresenius Kabi Vigilant MasterMed version 2.0.1.3 application and impersonate arbitrary users. An attacker could manipulate RabbitMQ queues and messages by impersonating users.
- **CVE-2021-32978**: The programming protocol allows for a previously entered password and lock state to be read by an attacker. If the previously entered password was successful, the attacker can then use the password to unlock Automation Direct CLICK PLC CPU Modules: C0-1x CPUs with firmware prior to v3.00.
