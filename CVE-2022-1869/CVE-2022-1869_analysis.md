- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a secondary candidate. The vulnerability description mentions "heap corruption", and type confusion can sometimes lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities. The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-416 as a potential match. However, the primary focus of the description and summary is on type confusion, making CWE-843 a more direct and appropriate mapping. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. Its Usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is related to memory management issues. While not directly stated, type confusion might lead to memory corruption issues such as use-after-free.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Supporting evidence but not as direct as CWE-843)
