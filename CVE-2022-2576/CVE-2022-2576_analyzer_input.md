# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-2576

## Vulnerability Description
In Eclipse Californium version 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0-3.5.0 a **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch** without using a HelloVerifyRequest. Especially, if used with certificate based cipher suites, that results in message amplification (DDoS other peers) and high CPU load (DoS own peer). The misbehavior occurs only with DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD values larger than 0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch**
- **impact:** message amplification and high CPU load
- **vector:** mismatch in DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD values
- **product:** Eclipse Californium
- **version:** 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0-3.5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2576:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) implementation of Eclipse Californium. Specifically, during session resumption, if a client attempts to resume a session with a different cipher suite than what was initially negotiated, the server incorrectly falls back to a full handshake without performing a stateless cookie exchange using a HelloVerifyRequest. This bypass of the cookie exchange mechanism is the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing HelloVerifyRequest during fallback:** The DTLS server fails to send a `HelloVerifyRequest` when a session resumption attempt triggers a fallback to a full handshake due to a parameter mismatch (e.g., different cipher suite).
*   **Bypass of DoS protection:** The stateless cookie exchange, intended to protect against DoS attacks, is skipped, making the server susceptible to resource exhaustion and amplification attacks.
*   **Incorrect handling of session resumption:** The server does not properly enforce the requirement for the same cipher suite during session resumption.
*  **Missing check of cipher suite**: During session resumption, the server did not check if the cipher suite of the client hello matched the one from the stored session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DoS on the server. By repeatedly sending ClientHello messages with different cipher suites but valid session IDs, the attacker can force the server into expensive full handshakes, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory).
*   **Amplification Attack:** The vulnerability also exposes the server to use as an amplification vector. An attacker can send connection initiation messages with a forged source IP address, causing the server to send large responses (e.g., Certificate messages) to the victim, potentially overwhelming the victim's network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted DTLS handshake messages (ClientHello).
*   **Spoofed IP address:** By using forged source addresses the attacker can perform an amplification attack.
*   **Repeated Session Resumption Attempts:** The attack relies on the server's failure to perform a `HelloVerifyRequest` during a full handshake fallback on session resumption attempts with mismatched parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable DTLS server.
*   **Valid Session IDs:** The attacker must obtain valid session IDs from previous connections to initiate the attack, if `DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD` is enabled.
*   **Ability to Send DTLS Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send DTLS packets (ClientHello) with specific parameters, including a valid session ID and a different cipher suite.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Eclipse Californium versions 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0 to 3.5.0
*   The vulnerability is triggered when  `DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD` is larger than zero. Setting this property to 0 mitigates the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves ensuring the HelloVerifyRequest is always used when falling back to a full handshake.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-408 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification)
