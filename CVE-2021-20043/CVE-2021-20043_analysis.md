## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**Heap-based buffer overflow**" vulnerability. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE that directly matches this description. The vulnerability allows a remote authenticated attacker to potentially execute code as the nobody user, indicating a severe impact stemming directly from the **heap overflow**. The description's key phrases highlight the **heap-based buffer overflow** as the **rootcause**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of a buffer overflow, specifically occurring in the heap. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a more general class, CWE-122 provides the necessary specificity given the evidence.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match with the vulnerability description and a specific CWE variant).
