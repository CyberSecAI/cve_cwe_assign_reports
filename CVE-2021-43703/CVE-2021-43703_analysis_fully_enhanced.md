# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability allows direct access to the administrator console by disabling JavaScript, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism. This aligns with the description of CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], where the application fails to adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs. The client-side redirect is intended to prevent unauthorized access, but can be easily bypassed. The **incorrect access control** allows an attacker to directly request and access the admin panel. MITRE guidance marks CWE-425 as ALLOWED for use. While other CWEs such as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) are related, CWE-425 best captures the direct request aspect of the vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships found for CWE-425.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539): An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26679**: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as "profile pictures." The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.
- **CVE-2021-41847**: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.
- **CVE-2021-22906**: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.
- **CVE-2021-21012**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **CVE-2021-21013**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the customer API module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure and update arbitrary information on another user's account.
- **CVE-2021-21022**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the product module. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
- **CVE-2021-21255**: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- **CVE-2021-24318**: The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.
- **CVE-2021-26024**: The Favorites component before 1.0.2 for Nagios XI 5.8.0 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference: it is possible to create favorites for any other user account.
