# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability allows direct access to the administrator console by disabling JavaScript, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism. This aligns with the description of CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], where the application fails to adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs. The client-side redirect is intended to prevent unauthorized access, but can be easily bypassed. The **incorrect access control** allows an attacker to directly request and access the admin panel. MITRE guidance marks CWE-425 as ALLOWED for use. While other CWEs such as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) are related, CWE-425 best captures the direct request aspect of the vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships found for CWE-425.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
