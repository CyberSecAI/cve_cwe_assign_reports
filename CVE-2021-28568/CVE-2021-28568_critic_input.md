## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **Insecure file permission** issue during the installation process of Adobe Genuine Services. This directly aligns with CWE-276, which describes the scenario where "During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files." The vulnerability allows a local authenticated attacker to escalate privileges, which is a direct consequence of the **insecure file permission**. CWE-276 is a Base level CWE, making it a preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever Results also list CWE-276 as a highly relevant CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-276 is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-276 is related to CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) as CWE-276 can be seen as a specific case of CWE-732. However, since the description specifically mentions the installation process, CWE-276 is more precise. Although the Retriever Results also mention CWE-732, I am selecting CWE-276 as the primary weakness because it is a more specific base level CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supportive retriever results)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is a Class level CWE that describes a situation where a product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors. While the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **Insecure file permission**, the affected resource is implicitly security-critical. The retriever results identify CWE-732 as a candidate. However, given the explicit mention of the installation process and the existence of CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions), CWE-732 is a less precise fit. The mapping guidance for CWE-732 is Allowed-with-Review, cautioning that it's often misused for authorization weaknesses."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-732 is a parent of CWE-276. Given the explicit mention of the installation process, CWE-276 is a better fit, and CWE-732 is only considered as a secondary, more general, weakness. The relationship between CWE-276 and CWE-732 influenced the decision to include it as a secondary weakness."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Indirect evidence from the vulnerability description and supportive retriever results)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-43037**: An issue was discovered in Kaseya Unitrends Backup Appliance before 10.5.5. The Unitrends Windows agent was vulnerable to DLL injection and binary planting due to insecure default permissions. This allowed privilege escalation from an unprivileged user to SYSTEM.
- **CVE-2020-9451**: An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe keeps a log in a folder where unprivileged users have write permissions. The logs are generated in a predictable pattern, allowing an unprivileged user to create a hardlink from a (not yet created) log file to anti_ransomware_service.exe. On reboot, this forces the anti_ransomware_service to try to write its log into its own process, crashing in a SHARING VIOLATION. This crash occurs on every reboot.
- **CVE-2021-31540**: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.5 (in a default installation) has incorrect file permissions of configuration files in the conf/ directory. A regular local user is able to read and write to all the configuration files, e.g., modify the application server configuration.


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-732
ChildOf -> CWE-732

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** The architecture needs to access and modification attributes for files to only those users who actually require those actions.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1941:** Executables installed world-writable.
- **CVE-2002-1713:** Home directories installed world-readable.
- **CVE-2001-1550:** World-writable log files allow information loss; world-readable file has cleartext passwords.



## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ParentOf -> CWE-1004
ParentOf -> CWE-276
ParentOf -> CWE-277
ParentOf -> CWE-278
ParentOf -> CWE-279
ParentOf -> CWE-281
RequiredBy -> CWE-61
RequiredBy -> CWE-689
ParentOf -> CWE-766

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When using a critical resource such as a configuration file, check to see if the resource has insecure permissions (such as being modifiable by any regular user) [REF-62], and generate an error or even exit the software if there is a possibility that the resource could have been modified by an unauthorized party.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully defining distinct user groups, privileges, and/or roles. Map these against data, functionality, and the related resources. Then set the permissions accordingly. This will allow you to maintain more fine-grained control over your resources. [REF-207]

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Strategy:** Sandbox or Jail
- **Description:** 

Run the code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.


OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.


This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.


Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.
