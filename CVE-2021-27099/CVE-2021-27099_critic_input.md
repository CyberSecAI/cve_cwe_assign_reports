# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
In SPIRE before versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1, the aws_iid Node Attestor **improperly normalizes the path** provided through the agent ID templating feature, which may allow the issuance of an arbitrary SPIFFE ID within the same trust domain, if the attacker controls the value of an EC2 tag prior to attestation, and the attestor is configured for agent ID templating where the tag value is the last element in the path. This issue has been fixed in SPIRE versions 0.11.3 and 0.12.1

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improperly normalizes the path**
- **impact:** issuance of an arbitrary SPIFFE ID
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** SPIRE
- **version:** before versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1
- **component:** aws_iid Node Attestor

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "aws\_iid" Node Attestor in SPIRE improperly normalizes the path provided through the agent ID templating feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper path normalization in the "aws_iid" Node Attestor.
- The agent ID templating feature uses an EC2 tag value as the last element in the path, which, if controlled by an attacker, can be used to issue an arbitrary SPIFFE ID within the same trust domain.
-  SPIRE Server accepts non-normalized SPIFFE IDs, allowing for potentially inconsistent behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who controls the value of an EC2 tag can potentially obtain an arbitrary SPIFFE ID within the same trust domain. This could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the SPIRE infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker controls the value of an EC2 tag prior to attestation.
- The `aws_iid` attestor is configured for agent ID templating where the tag value is the last element in the path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control the value of an EC2 tag used in the agent ID template.
- The attacker must have access to a node that can be attested via the vulnerable `aws_iid` attestor.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that the `aws_iid` Node Attestor **improperly normalizes the path**, which can lead to the issuance of an arbitrary SPIFFE ID. This aligns with CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory), as the path normalization is intended to restrict access within a specific directory or trust domain. Because the path normalization is **improper**, it allows the attacker to traverse outside the intended boundaries and obtain an arbitrary SPIFFE ID."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-22 is related to CWE-706 (Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference) as the improperly normalized path leads to a reference (SPIFFE ID) that resolves outside the intended control sphere. While CWE-706 is a Class-level CWE and less specific, it represents a consequence of the path traversal. The graph retriever also suggests CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), which might be tangentially related if the SPIFFE ID is considered sensitive information being improperly disclosed. However, CWE-22 is a more direct representation of the **root cause**, making it the primary CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence due to specific mention of "improperly normalizes the path" and the resulting ability to issue arbitrary SPIFFE IDs)

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.


Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.


Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes ".." sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). This includes:


  - realpath() in C

  - getCanonicalPath() in Java

  - GetFullPath() in ASP.NET

  - realpath() or abs_path() in Perl

  - realpath() in PHP





### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.
