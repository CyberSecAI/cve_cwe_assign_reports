# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-27099

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves improper normalization of paths, leading to the potential issuance of arbitrary SPIFFE IDs.|
| CWE-706 | Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: The reference to a resource (SPIFFE ID) resolves to a resource outside the intended control sphere due to improper path normalization. |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.3 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: Issuance of an arbitrary SPIFFE ID might be considered sensitive information being sent where it shouldn't be. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that the `aws_iid` Node Attestor **improperly normalizes the path**, which can lead to the issuance of an arbitrary SPIFFE ID. This aligns with CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory), as the path normalization is intended to restrict access within a specific directory or trust domain. Because the path normalization is **improper**, it allows the attacker to traverse outside the intended boundaries and obtain an arbitrary SPIFFE ID."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-22 is related to CWE-706 (Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference) as the improperly normalized path leads to a reference (SPIFFE ID) that resolves outside the intended control sphere. While CWE-706 is a Class-level CWE and less specific, it represents a consequence of the path traversal. The graph retriever also suggests CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), which might be tangentially related if the SPIFFE ID is considered sensitive information being improperly disclosed. However, CWE-22 is a more direct representation of the **root cause**, making it the primary CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence due to specific mention of "improperly normalizes the path" and the resulting ability to issue arbitrary SPIFFE IDs)

## Known Examples for CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-27099**: In SPIRE before versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1, the "aws_iid" Node Attestor improperly normalizes the path provided through the agent ID templating feature, which may allow the issuance of an arbitrary SPIFFE ID within the same trust domain, if the attacker controls the value of an EC2 tag prior to attestation, and the attestor is configured for agent ID templating where the tag value is the last element in the path. This issue has been fixed in SPIRE versions 0.11.3 and 0.12.1


## Known Examples for CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708): Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24226**: In the AccessAlly WordPress plugin before 3.5.7, the file "resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php" responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode is dumping serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.
- **CVE-2021-33687**: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.
- **CVE-2021-3509**: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **CVE-2021-34771**: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.
- **CVE-2021-25122**: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.
- **CVE-2021-0644**: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462
- **CVE-2020-11922**: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
- **CVE-2021-24170**: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.
