## Vulnerability Description
An **integer overflow** in the processing of loaded 2D images leads to a **write-what-where** vulnerability and an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability, allowing an attacker to leak sensitive information or achieve code execution in the context of the Blender process when a specially crafted image file is loaded. This flaw affects Blender versions prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **weakness:** **write-what-where and out-of-bounds read**
- **impact:** leak sensitive information and code execution
- **vector:** specially crafted image file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Blender
- **version:** prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-0545:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `IMB_flipy()` function within `source/blender/imbuf/intern/rotate.c` of Blender.
*   The function is responsible for flipping images vertically.
*   The root cause is a missing bounds check which can lead to an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:**  By crafting an image with specific large dimensions, the `bottomf` pointer within `IMB_flipy()` can wrap around to point before the `topf` pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This allows an attacker to overwrite memory locations controlled by the attacker via the image data.
*   **Integer Overflow:** A large `ibuf->x` can cause an integer overflow before allocating memory for the `linef` buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow/out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By overwriting critical memory locations, like return addresses on the stack or function pointers, an attacker can hijack the execution flow of the Blender process and gain control over the system.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt other parts of memory, potentially leading to crashes and instability.
*   **Information Leak:** The integer overflow vulnerability could result in an out-of-bounds read which could leak sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted image file. An attacker can craft an image with specific dimensions to trigger the out-of-bounds write in `IMB_flipy()` when the image is loaded or flipped.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to load the crafted image into Blender, often via the "Image Texture" node. This requires user interaction to execute the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Craft Image:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific image file with tailored dimensions that cause the vulnerable code path to be reached and the out-of-bounds write/read to occur.
*   **Lure User:** The attacker needs a method to lure a user into loading the malicious image file into Blender.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is not specific to HDR images, as the vulnerability lies in the `IMB_flipy` function itself, which is used for image flipping regardless of format.
*   The provided example uses an HDR image to trigger the vulnerability, but this is just one way of exploiting it, with specific dimensions.
*  Multiple fixes were proposed because there were multiple ways to trigger the vulnerability.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an **integer overflow** as the root cause, leading to a **write-what-where** vulnerability and an **out-of-bounds read**. The CVE reference confirms this, noting that a missing bounds check in `IMB_flipy()` can cause an integer overflow. Specifically, a large `ibuf->x` can overflow when allocating memory for the `linef` buffer, causing a heap buffer overflow and out-of-bounds write. This aligns directly with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The resulting out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) allows attackers to overwrite memory locations, leading to potential code execution. Additionally, the **integer overflow** leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125) which can leak sensitive information.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a base-level weakness. It can lead to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The retriever results also support this choice, with CWE-190 having a high score.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *CWE-190 Confidence: 0.95* (High confidence due to explicit mention in the description and CVE details)
  - *CWE-787 Confidence: 0.90* (High confidence as a direct consequence of the integer overflow leading to memory corruption)
  - *CWE-125 Confidence: 0.85* (High confidence as a direct consequence of the integer overflow leading to information leak)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Ensure that all protocols are strictly defined, such that all out-of-bounds behavior can be identified simply, and require strict conformance to the protocol.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


If possible, choose a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Use libraries or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences.


Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++). [REF-106]




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
