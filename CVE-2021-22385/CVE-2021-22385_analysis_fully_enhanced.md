# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-15 | External Control of System or Configuration Setting | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "External Control of System or Configuration Setting vulnerability". This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-15, which describes a weakness where the product allows external control over system or configuration settings. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions that the vulnerability lies in the NFC-based connection authentication process, leading to a bypass when exploited. This indicates that an attacker can potentially manipulate system configurations related to NFC authentication. The fact that this leads to Kernel Code Execution indicates a critical configuration is being controlled externally. This confirms the relevance of CWE-15. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-15 allows its use as it is a Base level CWE.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-15 is a base level CWE, exploring its relationships reveals that it can be a root cause for other weaknesses, such as privilege escalation or information disclosure. No specific relationship is highlighted as essential in this case, but CWE-15 is a good fit as the root cause.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

## Known Examples for CWE-15: External Control of System or Configuration Setting
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-22385**: A component of the Huawei smartphone has a External Control of System or Configuration Setting vulnerability. Local attackers may exploit this vulnerability to cause Kernel Code Execution.
- **CVE-2021-22420**: A component of the HarmonyOS has a External Control of System or Configuration Setting vulnerability. Local attackers may exploit this vulnerability to cause the underlying trust of the application trustlist mechanism is missing..
- **CVE-2021-22454**: A component of the HarmonyOS has a External Control of System or Configuration Setting vulnerability. Local attackers may exploit this vulnerability to cause core dump.
- **CVE-2021-22468**: A component of the HarmonyOS has a Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability. Local attackers may exploit this vulnerability to cause kernel address leakage.
- **CVE-2021-20461**: IBM Cognos Analytics 10.0 and 11.1 is susceptible to a weakness in the implementation of the System Appearance configuration setting. An attacker could potentially bypass business logic to modify the appearance and behavior of the application. IBM X-Force ID: 196770.
- **CVE-2021-37112**: Hisuite module has a External Control of System or Configuration Setting vulnerability.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to Firmware leak.
- **CVE-2021-39971**: Password vault has a External Control of System or Configuration Setting vulnerability.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could compromise confidentiality.
- **CVE-2022-48198**: The ntpd_driver component before 1.3.0 and 2.x before 2.2.0 for Robot Operating System (ROS) allows attackers, who control the source code of a different node in the same ROS application, to change a robot's behavior. This occurs because a topic name depends on the attacker-controlled time_ref_topic parameter.
- **CVE-2022-29850**: Various Lexmark products through 2022-04-27 allow an attacker who has already compromised an affected Lexmark device to maintain persistence across reboots.
