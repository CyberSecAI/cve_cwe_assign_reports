### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**
- **impact:** discover Cloud end-to-end encryption key
- **product:** Gallagher Command Centre
- **version:** 8.40 versions prior to 8.40.1888
- **component:** server memory

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory. Specifically, the Cloud end-to-end encryption key is stored in cleartext in the Gallagher Command Centre Server's memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the storage of the encryption key in cleartext within the server's memory, allowing it to be potentially exposed in memory dumps.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially obtain the Cloud end-to-end encryption key from server memory dumps. This could lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data or systems that rely on this key.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to obtain a memory dump of the affected Command Centre Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) to obtain the memory dump of the server.
