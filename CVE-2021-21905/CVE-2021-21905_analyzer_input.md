# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21905

## Vulnerability Description
**Stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in how the CMA readfile function of Garrett Metal Detectors iC Module CMA Version 5.0 is used at various locations. The Garrett iC Module exposes an authenticated CLI over TCP port 6877. This interface is used by a secondary GUI client, called CMA Connect, to interact with the iC Module on behalf of the user. After a client successfully authenticates, they can send plaintext commands to manipulate the device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Stack-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Garrett Metal Detectors iC Module
- **version:** CMA Version 5.0
- **component:** CMA readfile function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the usage of the `readfile` function within the Garrett Metal Detectors iC Module CMA software. This function reads data from a specified file into a buffer without any bounds checking, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `readfile` function copies file contents into a fixed-size buffer without checking if the file size exceeds the buffer's capacity. This can overwrite stack data, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Unsafe `readfile` Implementation:** The `readfile` function lacks any validation of the destination buffer, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows if provided with a file that is larger than the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite the return address, gaining control of the program counter and enabling arbitrary code execution on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CVE-2021-21905:** The vulnerability lies in the `get_ip` function, triggered via the `ipconfig` CLI command. An attacker can exploit this by first setting a long string as the `public_ip` environment variable via the CLI using the `setenv public_ip [value]` command. Subsequently, when the `ipconfig` command is executed, the `get_ip` function attempts to read the attacker controlled `public_ip` environment variable into the buffer on the stack leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **CVE-2021-21906:** This vulnerability is triggered during user authentication using the `checkPassword` function. The password comparison logic uses the `readfile` function to read `/ltrx_user/secret` into a 35-byte buffer. If an attacker can overwrite this file (via another vulnerability), they can place a long string within the secret file, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow when the `checkPassword` function attempts to read the content during user authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated CLI access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the iC Module's command-line interface (CLI) over TCP port 6877 to exploit both vulnerabilities.
*   **For CVE-2021-21905:** The attacker needs the ability to use the `setenv` command to manipulate the `public_ip` environment variable.
*   **For CVE-2021-21906:** The attacker needs to have the ability to alter the contents of `/ltrx_user/secret` (which might require exploiting another vulnerability).

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided report gives an approximate decompilation of relevant functions for clarity.
*   The report includes crash information showing the program counter being overwritten with attacker-controlled values (0x41414140).
*   The report provides a proof-of-concept exploit for both vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Matt Wiseman of Cisco Talos.
*   The vendor patched the vulnerabilities after disclosure.
