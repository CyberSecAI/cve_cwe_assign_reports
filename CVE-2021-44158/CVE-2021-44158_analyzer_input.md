# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-44158

## Vulnerability Description
ASUS RT-AX56U Wi-Fi Router is vulnerable to **stack-based buffer overflow** due to **improper validation for httpd parameter length**. An authenticated local area network attacker can launch arbitrary code execution to control the system or disrupt service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper validation for httpd parameter length**
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution and disrupt service
- **attacker:** authenticated local area network attacker
- **product:** ASUS RT-AX56U Wi-Fi Router

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ASUS RT-AX56U wireless router's httpd configuration lacks parameter length validation, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing parameter length validation in the httpd configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker on the local network, with regular user privileges, can execute arbitrary code. This allows for complete system control or denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is on the same local network as the router and has valid user credentials to log in to the router's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable ASUS RT-AX56U router and have valid user credentials to login to the router's web interface.
