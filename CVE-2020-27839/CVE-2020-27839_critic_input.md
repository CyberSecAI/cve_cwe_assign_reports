## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ceph-dashboard frontend application stores the JSON Web Token (JWT) used for user authentication in the browser's localStorage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Storage:** Using localStorage for sensitive data like JWTs makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks. If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, they can access the JWT stored in localStorage.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability stems from the potential for XSS attacks. If any of the application's dependencies are compromised or other injection vectors are found, an attacker could potentially steal the JWT.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** If the JWT is stolen, an attacker can impersonate the user and perform actions within the Ceph dashboard, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain complete access to the Ceph dashboard and all its functionality using the stolen JWT.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XSS Attacks:** Malicious JavaScript injection into the ceph-dashboard application.
- **Compromised Dependencies:** If any of the npm or other dependencies are compromised.
- **Injection through translation files:** although this approach was not successful, it is mentioned as a possible attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject malicious code:** The attacker needs to find a way to inject JavaScript into the ceph-dashboard web application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Ceph dashboard interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The suggested mitigation was to stop using localStorage for JWT storage and to use secure cookies with appropriate flags (secure, HttpOnly, SameSite).
-  The issue was addressed by storing the JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie and employing SameSite=Strict flag for cookie security along with custom `Accept` header for added protection.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ceph-dashboard versions 14.2.17 and 15.2.9.
- Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 is not affected as it does not use authentication for the dashboard.
- Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployments use the ceph package directly from the Ceph channel and will not be updated at this time.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS) 4 shipped ceph package for the usage of RHOCS 4.2 only which has reached End of Life.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 does not include the ceph dashboard component.

# Analysis to Review
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability allows for XSS attacks due to improper storage of the JWT. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: JWT token stored in localStorage is susceptible to sniffing. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is the potential for **cross-site scripting (XSS)**, as attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into the ceph-dashboard web application and steal the JWT stored in the browser's localStorage. This directly aligns with CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), as the application doesn't properly neutralize input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts. The description states, "The JSON Web Token (JWT) used for user authentication is stored by the frontend application in the browsers localStorage which is potentially vulnerable to attackers via XSS attacks." The retriever results also confirm CWE-79 as the top match. The suggested mitigations, such as storing the JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie with the SameSite=Strict flag, directly address the XSS vulnerability. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a secondary concern because localStorage is not inherently encrypted, making the JWT susceptible to sniffing if XSS occurs. Also, if XSS occurs, it can lead to **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-79 is a base level weakness and a child of CWE-74. It is also related to CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery). The vulnerability description mentions XSS attacks as the primary vector, making CWE-79 the most specific and appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description, CVE reference content, and retriever results.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.
**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter control-plane syntax from all input.



### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, use anti-CSRF packages such as the OWASP CSRFGuard. [REF-330]


Another example is the ESAPI Session Management control, which includes a component for CSRF. [REF-45]


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that the application is free of cross-site scripting issues (CWE-79), because most CSRF defenses can be bypassed using attacker-controlled script.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Generate a unique nonce for each form, place the nonce into the form, and verify the nonce upon receipt of the form. Be sure that the nonce is not predictable (CWE-330). [REF-332]



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Before transmitting, encrypt the data using reliable, confidentiality-protecting cryptographic protocols.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When using web applications with SSL, use SSL for the entire session from login to logout, not just for the initial login page.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When designing hardware platforms, ensure that approved encryption algorithms (such as those recommended by NIST) protect paths from security critical data to trusted user applications.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to generate properly encoded output include Microsoft's Anti-XSS library, the OWASP ESAPI Encoding module, and Apache Wicket.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.


For any data that will be output to another web page, especially any data that was received from external inputs, use the appropriate encoding on all non-alphanumeric characters.


Parts of the same output document may require different encodings, which will vary depending on whether the output is in the:


  - HTML body

  - Element attributes (such as src="XYZ")

  - URIs

  - JavaScript sections

  - Cascading Style Sheets and style property

etc. Note that HTML Entity Encoding is only appropriate for the HTML body.

Consult the XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet [REF-724] for more details on the types of encoding and escaping that are needed.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Applicable Platform]** 

XSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.
- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
