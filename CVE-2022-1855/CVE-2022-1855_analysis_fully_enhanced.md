# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**use after free**" condition in Google Chrome's Messaging component. This directly aligns with CWE-416, which describes the scenario where a product reuses memory after it has been freed. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the **root cause** as "**use-after-free**," further solidifying this mapping. The impact, leading to potential heap corruption, is a typical consequence of use-after-free vulnerabilities. CWE-416 is a Variant, which is the preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance designates its usage as ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other CWEs like CWE-415 (Double Free) and CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread) were considered based on retriever results, the explicit mention of "use after free" makes CWE-416 the most accurate. There are no direct relationships mentioned for CWE-416.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence of a use-after-free vulnerability)



## Known Examples for CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2621** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2621](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2621): Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0652**: In VectorDrawable::VectorDrawable of VectorDrawable.java, there is a possible way to introduce a memory corruption due to sharing of not thread-safe objects. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.
