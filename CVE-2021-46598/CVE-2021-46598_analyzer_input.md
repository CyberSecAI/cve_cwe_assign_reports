# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-46598

## Vulnerability Description
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT 10.16.0.80. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JT files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-15392.

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-46598:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of JT files. This inadequate validation leads to a memory corruption condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption (specifically, out-of-bounds and use-after-free conditions).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a user opening a maliciously crafted JT file in Bentley MicroStation CONNECT or visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable parsing logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file that exploits the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to lure a user into opening this malicious JT file or visiting a malicious page with the exploit.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Bentley MicroStation CONNECT and Bentley View.
- The vulnerability is addressed in versions 10.16.02.\* and later.
- The vulnerability was reported to Bentley on 2021-10-01 and publicly released on 2022-01-31.
