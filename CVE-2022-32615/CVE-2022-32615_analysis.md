## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**out of bounds write** due to **uninitialized data**". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" reinforces this, stating that the vulnerability stems from "an out-of-bounds write can occur due to the use of uninitialized data." This aligns directly with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which describes a condition where the product writes data past the end of the intended buffer. The root cause is described as "**uninitialized data**" which aligns to CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource).
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-908 can lead to CWE-787 because the use of uninitialized data can cause unexpected values that lead to an out-of-bounds write.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear technical description and CVE reference confirming the **out of bounds write** and the **uninitialized data**.)
---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states the rootcause is "**uninitialized data**" which aligns with CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource). The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" supports this, stating "an out-of-bounds write can occur due to the use of **uninitialized data**."
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence because the vulnerability description and CVE reference material clearly point to the use of **uninitialized data** as the root cause)
