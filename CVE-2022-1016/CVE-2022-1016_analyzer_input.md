# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1016

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.cnft_do_chain, which can cause **a use-after-free**. This issue needs to handle return with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **a use-after-free**
- **impact:** kernel information leak
- **attacker:** local unprivileged attacker
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.cnft_do_chain

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1016:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `nft_do_chain` function within the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem (specifically in `net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c`). This function doesn't initialize the register data (`struct nft_regs regs`) used by nftables expressions. These expressions can read from and write to the register data, which can contain sensitive kernel information like kernel image pointers, module pointers and allocation pointers, depending on the execution path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uninitialized Stack Data:** The `regs` struct on the stack is not initialized before being used by nftables expressions, leading to the possibility of leaking data present on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Information Leakage:** An attacker can exploit the uninitialized stack data to leak kernel memory contents, potentially exposing sensitive information like kernel pointers. This information can then be used to bypass kernel security mechanisms.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not direct, the information leak can help an attacker gain a foothold and facilitate a subsequent privilege escalation attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local, unprivileged user.
- The attacker needs the ability to create and configure nftables rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to create unprivileged user and network namespaces (`CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNET`).
- The attacker needs the ability to configure `nftables` rules to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path, which is accessible to users with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.

**Technical Details**
- The `nft_do_chain` function in `net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c` is vulnerable.
- The `struct nft_regs` on the stack is not initialized before being used by nftables expressions.
- The expressions can read the data and leak kernel pointers.
- The vulnerability is exploitable starting from kernel version 3.13-rc1.
- The fix was introduced in commit 4c905f6740a3 ("netfilter: nf_tables: initialize registers in nft_do_chain()").

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content includes the following:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability from the original discoverer including code snippets showing where the issue lies.
- Information about the fix and the commit that resolved the vulnerability.
- Links to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) related to the vulnerability, which shows that it affects multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.
- The original report also mentions CVE-2022-1015, an out-of-bounds access vulnerability in `nf_tables`, but the provided context focuses on CVE-2022-1016.
