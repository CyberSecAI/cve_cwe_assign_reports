# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-2950

## Vulnerability Description
Altair HyperView Playerversions 2021.1.0.27 and priorare vulnerable to the **use of uninitialized memory** vulnerability during parsing of H3D files. A DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer and, after sign extension, is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter leading to memory corruption.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of uninitialized memory**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **product:** Altair HyperView Player
- **version:** 2021.1.0.27 and prior

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2950.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the use of uninitialized memory during the parsing of H3D files. Specifically, a DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer, and after sign extension, this value is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter. This leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908)

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption and a crash of the device accessing the file.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves parsing a malicious H3D file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted H3D file to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to have a user execute this file on a vulnerable system. The attack vector is local, which means the attacker likely needs access to the machine.
