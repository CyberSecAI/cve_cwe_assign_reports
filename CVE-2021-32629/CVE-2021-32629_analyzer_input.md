# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-32629

## Vulnerability Description
Cranelift is an open-source code generator maintained by Bytecode Alliance. It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32s MSB. The issue would thus occur when * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000 * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the values definition and its use * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be special in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination add, sub, mul, and, or * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **sign-extend instead of zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack**
- **impact:** ['potential sandbox escape', 'read memory from a computable range']
- **product:** Cranelift x64 backend
- **version:** 0.73

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32629:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect code generation in the Cranelift x64 backend, specifically during the spilling and reloading of integer values from the stack. When a 32-bit integer value is spilled and later reloaded, the code incorrectly performs a sign-extension instead of a zero-extension. This occurs when the register allocator spills the value due to high register pressure, and the value is produced by an instruction that is known to zero the upper 32-bits of the destination register. This is problematic because the compiler relies on the upper 32-bits of an i32 to be zero, and the incorrect sign extension can lead to an out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Sign Extension:** The core vulnerability is the use of a sign-extension instead of a zero-extension when reloading a spilled 32-bit integer value from the stack.
*   **Optimization Reliance:** The instruction selector's optimization of eliding the 32-to-64-bit zero-extension, relying on the zeroed upper 32 bits from specific instructions, is also a contributing factor.
*   **Type Confusion:**  The type of the value is still i32 but reloaded as sign extended 64bit value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Escape:** A successful exploit could allow a WebAssembly module to access memory outside of its designated sandbox, potentially accessing up to 2GiB of memory before the start of its allocated heap. This out-of-bounds memory access could lead to arbitrary code execution by reading or writing to different parts of the memory.
*   **Control Flow Subversion:** In the context of a system like Fastly's Compute@Edge, this could be used to potentially subvert control flow in the daemon process.
*   **Memory Corruption/Crashes:**  If the memory accessed outside the sandbox is not valid for reading, the program would likely crash due to an out-of-bounds memory access, or assertion failure.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If attacker is able to craft a WASM module that bypasses the guard pages, they might be able to read memory from other sandboxes

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WebAssembly Modules:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious WebAssembly module that triggers the specific conditions required for the vulnerability.
*   **Specific Conditions:** The attack requires:
    *   An i32 value greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000
    *   The value being spilled and reloaded due to register pressure.
    *   The value being produced by instructions that zero the upper 32 bits of the register.
    *   The value being used in a context where it's zero-extended to 64-bits (such as heap access).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Upload/Execute WebAssembly:**  The attacker needs the capability to upload and execute a specially crafted WebAssembly module, for example in a platform like Fastly's Compute@Edge or a vulnerable Wasmtime environment.
*   **Understanding of Cranelift Backend:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the Cranelift x64 backend, particularly how spilling and reloading works, and also the memory layout and heap structures of the environment the code is running in.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Cranelift versions up to 0.73.0. It was fixed in versions 0.73.1 and 0.74.0.
*   The impact is highly dependent on the environment, particularly how memory is allocated and managed for WebAssembly modules (e.g., the presence of guard pages).
*   Mitigation strategies include using memory allocators that employ Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and/or guard pages.
*   The issue was discovered through monitoring of unusual behaviour by WebAssembly modules.

This is a critical vulnerability that could lead to severe security issues if not addressed properly.
