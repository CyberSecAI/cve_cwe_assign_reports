### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** bypass authentication and takeover of any user account
- **vector:** specially crafted request
- **attacker:** unauthenticated users
- **product:** october/system package

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how October CMS handles user authentication via "persist" cookies. Specifically, the system's permission checking logic was susceptible to type juggling issues, where string values were not being strictly compared as integers. This allowed an attacker, with knowledge of Laravel's secret key, to craft a malicious persist cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Juggling:** The code used loose comparison operators (`==`) instead of strict comparison operators (`===`) when checking permission values, leading to type juggling issues where string values could be interpreted as integers.
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The system's logic for checking permissions based on a "persist" cookie allowed for crafting of malicious cookies if the Laravel secret key was known.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to user accounts without knowing the user's actual credentials.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to another user's account, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges depending on the targeted user's roles and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Cookie Creation:** The primary attack vector is the crafting of a malicious "persist" cookie. This required the attacker to:
  1. Obtain Laravel's secret key used for cookie encryption.
  2. Know the user ID they are targeting and the nature of permissions to spoof.
  3. Craft a cookie with manipulated permissions.
- **Cookie Injection:** Once the crafted cookie exists, the attacker would need to inject or use the malicious cookie in a request to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Laravel's secret key:** This key is necessary to create a valid cookie and required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Target User ID:** The attacker needs to know the user ID of the target they want to impersonate.
- **User Logged in:** The targeted user must be logged in while the attacker is exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in October CMS builds 472 and v1.1.5.
- Patches are available at `octobercms/library@016a297` and `octobercms/library@5bd1a28`.
- The vulnerability is not logged in access logs when exploited via the "persist" cookie.

The provided commit diffs show how the vulnerability was addressed by converting the loose comparison operators (`==`) to strict comparison operators (`===`) and by explicitly casting the values to integers using `(int)`. This ensures that comparisons are performed on the correct data types.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights that an attacker can **bypass authentication** and takeover any user account due to a specially crafted request. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is a flaw in how October CMS handles user authentication via 'persist' cookies, specifically mentioning **type juggling issues** where string values were not strictly compared as integers. This enables the creation of malicious persist cookies with knowledge of Laravel's secret key. While several CWEs were suggested, CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] aligns directly with the core issue of bypassing the authentication mechanism. Although CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is related, CWE-287 is more appropriate here as the application attempts authentication but fails to do so correctly."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE. It is a parent of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The exploit involves bypassing authentication checks through type juggling, which highlights the failure to properly validate user identity claims. This can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of authentication bypass and detailed explanation of the root cause in CVE reference).

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability enables an attacker to **take over any user account**. The CVE summary indicates this is achieved by crafting a malicious cookie which modifies permissions, thus allowing unauthorized access to other user accounts. This aligns with CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key], where an attacker gains access to another user's data by modifying the key value identifying the data."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-639 is a Base-level CWE and has no direct relationships. It captures the essence of modifying a key (in this case, via a cookie) to access unauthorized data."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence because the vulnerability's primary description focuses on authentication bypass, with authorization bypass being a consequence).
---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions **type juggling** caused by using loose comparison operators (`==`) instead of strict comparison operators (`===`) when checking permission values. This falls under CWE-1025 [Comparison Using Wrong Factors], as the code is examining the wrong factors (data types) during the comparison, leading to incorrect permission checks."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-1025 is a Base-level CWE. This weakness leads to improper permission validation and is a contributing factor in the overall authentication bypass."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Moderate confidence as it's a contributing factor rather than the primary cause of the authentication bypass. The type juggling enables the bypass, but is not the bypass itself.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.



## CWE-1025: Comparison Using Wrong Factors
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The code performs a comparison between two entities, but the comparison examines the wrong factors or characteristics of the entities, which can lead to incorrect results and resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description
This can lead to incorrect results and resultant weaknesses. For example, the code might inadvertently compare references to objects, instead of the relevant contents of those objects, causing two "equal" objects to be considered unequal.

### Alternative Terms
None
