# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-29487

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.95 | Class | Primary | The primary weakness lies in the application's failure to properly authenticate users, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication and take over accounts. |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.75 | Base | Secondary | An attacker can gain access to another user's data by modifying the key value identifying the data. |
| CWE-1025 | Comparison Using Wrong Factors | 0.65 | Base | Secondary | The code performs a comparison between two entities, but the comparison examines the wrong factors or characteristics of the entities. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights that an attacker can **bypass authentication** and takeover any user account due to a specially crafted request. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is a flaw in how October CMS handles user authentication via 'persist' cookies, specifically mentioning **type juggling issues** where string values were not strictly compared as integers. This enables the creation of malicious persist cookies with knowledge of Laravel's secret key. While several CWEs were suggested, CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] aligns directly with the core issue of bypassing the authentication mechanism. Although CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is related, CWE-287 is more appropriate here as the application attempts authentication but fails to do so correctly."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE. It is a parent of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The exploit involves bypassing authentication checks through type juggling, which highlights the failure to properly validate user identity claims. This can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of authentication bypass and detailed explanation of the root cause in CVE reference).

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability enables an attacker to **take over any user account**. The CVE summary indicates this is achieved by crafting a malicious cookie which modifies permissions, thus allowing unauthorized access to other user accounts. This aligns with CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key], where an attacker gains access to another user's data by modifying the key value identifying the data."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-639 is a Base-level CWE and has no direct relationships. It captures the essence of modifying a key (in this case, via a cookie) to access unauthorized data."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence because the vulnerability's primary description focuses on authentication bypass, with authorization bypass being a consequence).
---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions **type juggling** caused by using loose comparison operators (`==`) instead of strict comparison operators (`===`) when checking permission values. This falls under CWE-1025 [Comparison Using Wrong Factors], as the code is examining the wrong factors (data types) during the comparison, leading to incorrect permission checks."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-1025 is a Base-level CWE. This weakness leads to improper permission validation and is a contributing factor in the overall authentication bypass."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Moderate confidence as it's a contributing factor rather than the primary cause of the authentication bypass. The type juggling enables the bypass, but is not the bypass itself.)



## Known Examples for CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539): An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26679**: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as "profile pictures." The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.
- **CVE-2021-41847**: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.
- **CVE-2021-22906**: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.
- **CVE-2021-21012**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **CVE-2021-21013**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the customer API module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure and update arbitrary information on another user's account.
- **CVE-2021-21022**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the product module. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
- **CVE-2021-21255**: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- **CVE-2021-24318**: The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.
- **CVE-2021-26024**: The Favorites component before 1.0.2 for Nagios XI 5.8.0 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference: it is possible to create favorites for any other user account.
