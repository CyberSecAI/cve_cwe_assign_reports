## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**weak password requirements**" as the **rootcause**. This directly aligns with CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements, which describes a situation where "The product does not require that users should have strong passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts." The impact of the vulnerability, "unauthorized access to the Data Communication Network (DCN) routing configuration," reinforces the severity of the weakness. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-521 as the top match.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-521 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. There are no direct relationships that impact this choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match with the vulnerability description)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not require that users should have strong passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.

### Extended Description
Authentication mechanisms often rely on a memorized secret (also known as a password) to provide an assertion of identity for a user of a system. It is therefore important that this password be of sufficient complexity and impractical for an adversary to guess. The specific requirements around how complex a password needs to be depends on the type of system being protected. Selecting the correct password requirements and enforcing them through implementation are critical to the overall success of the authentication mechanism.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1391
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ParentOf -> CWE-258

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

A product's design should require adherance to an appropriate password policy. Specific password requirements depend strongly on contextual factors, but it is recommended to contain the following attributes:


  - Enforcement of a minimum and maximum length

  - Restrictions against password reuse

  - Restrictions against using common passwords

  - Restrictions against using contextual string in the password (e.g., user id, app name)

Depending on the threat model, the password policy may include several additional attributes.

  - Complex passwords requiring mixed character sets (alpha, numeric, special, mixed case) 
   - Increasing the range of characters makes the password harder to crack and may be appropriate for systems relying on single factor authentication.

   - Unfortunately, a complex password may be difficult to memorize, encouraging a user to select a short password or to incorrectly manage the password (write it down).

   - Another disadvantage of this approach is that it often does not result in a significant increases in overal password complexity due to people's predictable usage of various symbols.



  1. Large Minimum Length (encouraging passphrases instead of passwords) 
   - Increasing the number of characters makes the password harder to crack and may be appropriate for systems relying on single factor authentication.

   - A disadvantage of this approach is that selecting a good passphrase is not easy and poor passwords can still be generated. Some prompting may be needed to encourage long un-predictable passwords.



  1. Randomly Chosen Secrets 
   - Generating a password for the user can help make sure that length and complexity requirements are met, and can result in secure passwords being used.

   - A disadvantage of this approach is that the resulting password or passpharse may be too difficult to memorize, encouraging them to be written down.



  1. Password Expiration 
   - Requiring a periodic password change can reduce the time window that an adversary has to crack a password, while also limiting the damage caused by password exposures at other locations.

   - Password expiration may be a good mitigating technique when long complex passwords are not desired.



See NIST 800-63B [REF-1053] for further information on password requirements.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider a second authentication factor beyond the password, which prevents the password from being a single point of failure. See CWE-308 for further information.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Consider implementing a password complexity meter to inform users when a chosen password meets the required attributes.
