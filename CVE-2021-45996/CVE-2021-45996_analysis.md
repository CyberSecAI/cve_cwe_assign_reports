## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that there is a "**stack overflow**" in the `formSetPortMapping` function of Tenda routers G1 and G3. This **stack overflow** can be triggered by providing malicious input via the `portMappingServer`, `portMappingProtocol`, `portMappingWan`, `porMappingtInternal`, and `portMappingExternal` parameters, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). CWE-121, "Stack-based Buffer Overflow," directly addresses this type of vulnerability. The description aligns perfectly with the CWE definition, and the "Variant" level is appropriate as it specifies the location of the overflow (stack). The retriever results also list CWE-121 with a high score.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Since the vulnerability is specifically a **stack overflow**, CWE-121 is more specific and appropriate than its parent, CWE-119.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Direct evidence of a **stack overflow** from the vulnerability description)
