Specially-crafted configuration values can lead to **memory corruption**, **information disclosure** and denial of service. An attacker can modify a configuration value and then execute an XCMD to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from **format string injection** via the `default_key_id` and `key` configuration parameters, as used within the `testWifiAP` XCMD handler

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **format string injection**
- **weakness:** **memory corruption and information disclosure**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **product:** Abode Systems iota All-In-One Security Kit
- **version:** 6.9X and 6.9Z
- **component:** XCMD testWifiAP functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35876.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a format string injection vulnerability in the `log` function, which is used for logging diagnostic messages to the UART console. The `log` function uses `vsnprintf` with a user-controlled format string, allowing an attacker to inject format specifiers and potentially leak stack memory or cause memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-134:** Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
- The `do_test_wifiap` function constructs OS commands to configure the device's Wi-Fi using the `vsnprintf_nullterm` function. The `command` buffer, which becomes the format string in a call to the `log` function, contains attacker-controlled data obtained from various Wi-Fi configuration parameters, specifically `config->default_key_id` and `config->key` when the authentication mode is WEP or SHARED.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** By controlling the format string, an attacker could potentially write to arbitrary memory locations.
- **Information Disclosure:** By using format string specifiers such as `%x`, an attacker can potentially leak stack memory.
- **Denial of Service:**  Memory corruption can lead to crashes and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered via the `testWifiAP` XCMD, which does not expect any parameters.
- The attacker needs to modify the configuration parameters, specifically  `WL_DefaultKeyID` and `WL_Key` prior to triggering the vulnerable `testWifiAP` XCMD.
- These configuration values can be modified through the mobile application, web application, the `setWifiAP` XCMD or via the `/action/wirelessPost` or `/action/configPost` endpoints of the device's local web interface.
- The vulnerable code is executed after receiving the XCMD over UDP/55050, which does not require authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the device on UDP/55050 to execute the `testWifiAP` XCMD.
- The attacker does not need authentication to the device or the XMPP server to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to modify Wi-Fi configuration values, which can be done by any of the aforementioned mechanisms.
- The output of the format string vulnerability is only visible on the physical UART console, so a physical presence and knowledge of disassembly is needed for a more severe exploit.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **format string injection** in the XCMD testWifiAP functionality. The **root cause** is a format string injection vulnerability in the `log` function, which uses `vsnprintf` with a user-controlled format string. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers and potentially leak stack memory or cause **memory corruption**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-134 [Use of Externally-Controlled Format String]. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states that the vulnerable code uses `vsnprintf` with a user-controlled format string (`command` buffer), which contains attacker-controlled data obtained from various Wi-Fi configuration parameters. The Usage for CWE-134 is "Allowed," which supports the selection of this CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found with the top candidates.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of format string injection in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference.)

- **Analysis and Justification for Secondary Candidates:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions **memory corruption** and **information disclosure**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that the attacker could potentially leak stack memory (**information disclosure**) or write to arbitrary memory locations (**memory corruption**). The memory corruption could lead to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) and information disclosure could mean out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
  - *Explanation for CWE-125:* An attacker can use format string specifiers (like %x) to read stack memory that they should not be able to access, which is an out-of-bounds read. Given this, CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read] is a secondary candidate.
  - *Explanation for CWE-787:* By controlling the format string, an attacker can potentially write to arbitrary memory locations, causing memory corruption. This is an out-of-bounds write. Given this, CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write] is a secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Medium-High confidence because while memory corruption is mentioned as an impact, the root cause is format string injection (CWE-134).

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32785**: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled.
- **CVE-2021-33886**: An improper sanitization of input vulnerability in B.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

### Extended Description


When an attacker can modify an externally-controlled format string, this can lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or data representation problems.


It should be noted that in some circumstances, such as internationalization, the set of format strings is externally controlled by design. If the source of these format strings is trusted (e.g. only contained in library files that are only modifiable by the system administrator), then the external control might not itself pose a vulnerability.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668
CanPrecede -> CWE-123
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Choose a language that is not subject to this flaw.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that all format string functions are passed a static string which cannot be controlled by the user, and that the proper number of arguments are always sent to that function as well. If at all possible, use functions that do not support the %n operator in format strings. [REF-116] [REF-117]

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Build and Compilation
- **Description:** Run compilers and linkers with high warning levels, since they may detect incorrect usage.



### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

This weakness is possible in any programming language that support format strings.


**[Other]** 

While Format String vulnerabilities typically fall under the Buffer Overflow category, technically they are not overflowed buffers. The Format String vulnerability is fairly new (circa 1999) and stems from the fact that there is no realistic way for a function that takes a variable number of arguments to determine just how many arguments were passed in. The most common functions that take a variable number of arguments, including C-runtime functions, are the printf() family of calls. The Format String problem appears in a number of ways. A *printf() call without a format specifier is dangerous and can be exploited. For example, printf(input); is exploitable, while printf(y, input); is not exploitable in that context. The result of the first call, used incorrectly, allows for an attacker to be able to peek at stack memory since the input string will be used as the format specifier. The attacker can stuff the input string with format specifiers and begin reading stack values, since the remaining parameters will be pulled from the stack. Worst case, this improper use may give away enough control to allow an arbitrary value (or values in the case of an exploit program) to be written into the memory of the running program.


Frequently targeted entities are file names, process names, identifiers.


Format string problems are a classic C/C++ issue that are now rare due to the ease of discovery. One main reason format string vulnerabilities can be exploited is due to the %n operator. The %n operator will write the number of characters, which have been printed by the format string therefore far, to the memory pointed to by its argument. Through skilled creation of a format string, a malicious user may use values on the stack to create a write-what-where condition. Once this is achieved, they can execute arbitrary code. Other operators can be used as well; for example, a %9999s operator could also trigger a buffer overflow, or when used in file-formatting functions like fprintf, it can generate a much larger output than intended.


**[Research Gap]** Format string issues are under-studied for languages other than C. Memory or disk consumption, control flow or variable alteration, and data corruption may result from format string exploitation in applications written in other languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1825:** format string in Perl program
- **CVE-2001-0717:** format string in bad call to syslog function

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
