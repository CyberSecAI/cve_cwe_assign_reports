# Final Resolution for CVE-2020-19155

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | The attacker uploads a file with a safe extension and then renames it to a malicious extension. |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations. Necessary to exploit CWE-434. |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.65 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on the file rename functionality. This is the missing authorization on a critical function. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)**. This is facilitated by **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)**, as the ability to rename the file is crucial to the exploit. **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)** contributes by failing to restrict access to the rename functionality. **CWE-73** can precede **CWE-434**, creating a vulnerability chain. **CWE-862** allows the attacker to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)**, allowing an attacker to access the file renaming functionality. The attacker then uses **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)** to rename an uploaded file with a safe extension to a dangerous one. Finally, **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)** is triggered, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)** and **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)** as relevant weaknesses. The criticism suggested replacing **CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'))** with **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)**, which is a more precise representation of the **improper access control** aspect. The evidence supports this change as the vulnerability description mentions "Improper Access Control" and the need to access the admin panel. Therefore, **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)** is a better fit. The confidence level for **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)** has been raised to 0.75 to reflect its importance in enabling **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear understanding of the vulnerability's root cause and enabling factors.
