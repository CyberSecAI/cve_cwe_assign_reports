# Analysis for CVE-2020-19155

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | The attacker uploads a file with a safe extension and then renames it to a malicious extension. |
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations. |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves **improper access control** during file renaming in Jfinal CMS, where an attacker can rename uploaded files to malicious extensions like `.jsp`, leading to arbitrary code execution. This aligns primarily with CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type), as the attacker can upload a file with a safe extension (e.g., `.jpg`) and then rename it to a dangerous one. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is also relevant because the attacker controls the new file name. The weakness also has characteristics of CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) since access control on the rename function is not adequately enforced. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicates the ability to rename files to executable extensions, confirming the unrestricted upload risk.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-434 is related to CWE-73 because controlling the file name is a key aspect of exploiting the upload vulnerability. CWE-434 CanFollow CWE-73. CWE-425 is related as it represents the **improper access control** that makes the exploit possible.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials for CWE-434)
  - Confidence: 0.70 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials for CWE-73)
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Medium evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials for CWE-425)
