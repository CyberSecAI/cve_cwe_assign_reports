# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.85 | Base | Primary | ALLOWED |
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.75 | Base | Secondary | ALLOWED |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to a **race condition** in isp. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause as a "Time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition" and the weakness as "CWE-367." The primary weakness, **out of bounds write**, is best represented by CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is a Base level CWE. The root cause of the vulnerability is a **race condition**, which leads to the **out of bounds write**. Therefore, CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is selected as a secondary CWE. Both CWE-787 and CWE-367 are at the Base level of abstraction and are ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) can lead to various other weaknesses, including CWE-787.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.80 (High evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743): TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813): A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594): PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.
- **CVE-2008-2958** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
- **CVE-2008-1570** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1921**: Possible memory corruption due to Improper handling of hypervisor unmap operations for concurrent memory operations in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2021-29657**: arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.
- **CVE-2020-11233**: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition While processing partition entries due to newly created buffer was read again from mmc without validation in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables
- **CVE-2020-13882**: CISOfy Lynis before 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU race condition. The routine to check the log and report file permissions was not working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the race, an unprivileged attacker can set up a log and report file, and control that up to the point where the specific routine is doing its check. After that, the file can be removed, recreated, and used for additional attacks.
- **CVE-2020-15702**: TOCTOU Race Condition vulnerability in apport allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may exit the crashed process and exploit PID recycling to spawn a root process with the same PID as the crashed process, which can then be used to escalate privileges. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9 versions prior to 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.16 and 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.6. Was ZDI-CAN-11234.
