## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap buffer overflow**". CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of a buffer overflow that occurs in the heap, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The impact is remote information disclosure, which is a typical consequence of a heap overflow. The CWE description mentions that the buffer is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally using a routine such as malloc(). The retriever results also list CWE-122, and the MITRE mapping guidance is ALLOWED. The evidence from the vulnerability description is strong and directly supports this mapping."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Heap overflows can lead to other issues like arbitrary code execution or denial of service."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (Strong match based on explicit vulnerability description and mapping guidance.)
