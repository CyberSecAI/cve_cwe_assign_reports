# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-26259

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in htmldoc in v1.9.12. **Heap buffer overflow** in render_table_row(),in ps-pdf.cxx may lead to arbitrary code execution and denial of service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Heap buffer overflow**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution and denial of service
- **product:** htmldoc
- **version:** v1.9.12
- **component:** render_table_row() in ps-pdf.cxx

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `render_table_row()` function within `ps-pdf.cxx` of htmldoc. This is triggered by processing a crafted HTML document with a table containing a large or invalid border attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, specifically in the `render_table_row()` function. This occurs when the code attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size on the heap.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the `border` attribute of the HTML `<table>` tag. Specifically, it fails to check if the border value is within a reasonable range and can result in an extremely large value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A successful heap overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to run malicious code within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to the heap corruption, resulting in a denial of service.
*  **Memory Corruption**: The heap overflow can corrupt memory leading to unexpected program behavior or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack vector is classified as local, which means the attacker needs to have local access to the system where `htmldoc` is processing the malicious HTML file.
*   **File Input:** The attack is triggered by providing a crafted HTML file as input to the `htmldoc` application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the htmldoc application on a system with a crafted HTML document.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML document with a specially crafted `border` attribute in a `<table>` tag to trigger the heap buffer overflow.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `ps-pdf.cxx`, specifically the `render_table_row()` function.
*   The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing.
*   The issue was triggered by a bogus border value in a table, which was larger than the page.
*   The fix involved adding range checking to limit the border value to sane values.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-26259 after the fix was committed.
*   The CVSS score is 7.8, with a local attack vector, low complexity, no privileges required, user interaction required, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
