# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.85 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **use after free** due to a **race condition** in `lock_sock_nested` of sock.c in the Android kernel. The CVE reference summary supports this, stating that the root cause is a race condition that leads to a use-after-free in the `sctp_sock_dump` function. The socket is freed before a lock is acquired, leading to the use-after-free. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it precisely describes the core weakness: accessing memory after it has been freed. CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is a secondary CWE because the race condition is the mechanism that triggers the use-after-free. While CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread) and CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) were also suggested, they are less specific. CWE-416 is a Variant-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction and its usage is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry) and is PEEROF with CWE-415 (Double Free). The CVE summary describes a race condition triggering the use-after-free, indicating a relationship with concurrency issues, hence the inclusion of CWE-362.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the vulnerability description, CVE reference, and retriever results)
