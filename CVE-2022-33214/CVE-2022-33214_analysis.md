# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**time-of-check time-of-use**" (TOCTOU) as the **root cause**, leading to memory corruption. CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) directly addresses this weakness. The description perfectly aligns with the TOCTOU condition, where the state of metadata reserved size is checked, but the same metadata is used later without re-validation, leading to potential memory corruption if the size changes in between. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a plausible weakness since the **impact** is memory corruption. If the metadata reserved size has been changed, then it is possible that write operation may cause out-of-bounds write.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-367 has no direct relationships listed in the provided information. However, TOCTOU vulnerabilities often can lead to other issues such as out-of-bounds writes. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions TOCTOU)
