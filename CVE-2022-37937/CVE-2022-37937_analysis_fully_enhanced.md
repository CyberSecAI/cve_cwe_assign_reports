# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.8 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description indicates **Pre-auth memory corruption** in HPE Serviceguard. Based on the description, the most likely root cause is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). This is because memory corruption often stems from writing data outside the intended buffer boundaries. The provided information is limited, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact root cause with complete certainty. The retriever results also suggest CWE-787 as the top candidate, further supporting this classification. Without additional context, a more specific CWE cannot be determined."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-787 is a base-level weakness, which is appropriate given the limited information. It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a broader class of memory safety issues. CWE-787 can precede several other weaknesses, like CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-824 (Access of a Memory Location After the End of the Intended Buffer), suggesting potential follow-on vulnerabilities if the out-of-bounds write is exploited."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.8 (Due to limited information, while CWE-787 is the most likely, there's still some uncertainty)
