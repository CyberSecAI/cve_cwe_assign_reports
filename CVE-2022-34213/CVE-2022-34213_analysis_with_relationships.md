# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-260 | Password in Configuration File | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Jenkins plugin "**stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file**". This directly aligns with CWE-260, "Password in Configuration File," which describes the **rootcause** of storing passwords in a configuration file that might be accessible to unauthorized actors. This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, "The Squash TM Publisher (Squash4Jenkins) Plugin stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller." While other CWEs like CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) are relevant, CWE-260 is more specific as it highlights the configuration file storage, making it the primary and most accurate classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-260 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-260 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a class-level CWE that could apply, CWE-260 provides a more precise representation of the **weakness**. CWE-260 is related to CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password), which is a more general case of storing passwords in plaintext.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a relevant secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves **unencrypted storage of sensitive information**, specifically passwords. While CWE-260 is more specific about the configuration file, CWE-256 accurately describes the underlying issue of storing passwords in plaintext. The description mentions the password can be viewed, thus this directly related to the storage and not transport of the credentials. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-256 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). It is more specific than its parent, making it a better fit for the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Reasonable confidence, but CWE-260 is the more precise classification.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a relevant secondary CWE. The vulnerability description and CVE reference confirms the **rootcause** of storing sensitive information (passwords) in cleartext. This **weakness** aligns with the CWE-312 description. While other CWEs like CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) is more specific, CWE-312 accurately describes the underlying issue of storing sensitive information in cleartext. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-312 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 is a base-level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Reasonable confidence, but CWE-260 is the more precise classification.)
