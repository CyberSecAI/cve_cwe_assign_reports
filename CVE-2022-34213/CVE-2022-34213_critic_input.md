## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Jenkins plugin "**stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file**". This directly aligns with CWE-260, "Password in Configuration File," which describes the **rootcause** of storing passwords in a configuration file that might be accessible to unauthorized actors. This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, "The Squash TM Publisher (Squash4Jenkins) Plugin stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller." While other CWEs like CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) are relevant, CWE-260 is more specific as it highlights the configuration file storage, making it the primary and most accurate classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-260 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-260 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a class-level CWE that could apply, CWE-260 provides a more precise representation of the **weakness**. CWE-260 is related to CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password), which is a more general case of storing passwords in plaintext.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a relevant secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves **unencrypted storage of sensitive information**, specifically passwords. While CWE-260 is more specific about the configuration file, CWE-256 accurately describes the underlying issue of storing passwords in plaintext. The description mentions the password can be viewed, thus this directly related to the storage and not transport of the credentials. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-256 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). It is more specific than its parent, making it a better fit for the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Reasonable confidence, but CWE-260 is the more precise classification.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a relevant secondary CWE. The vulnerability description and CVE reference confirms the **rootcause** of storing sensitive information (passwords) in cleartext. This **weakness** aligns with the CWE-312 description. While other CWEs like CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) is more specific, CWE-312 accurately describes the underlying issue of storing sensitive information in cleartext. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-312 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 is a base-level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Reasonable confidence, but CWE-260 is the more precise classification.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms

- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, System Configuration, Operation
- **Description:** When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to encrypt the data at rest. [REF-1297] [REF-1299] [REF-1301]



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions



## CWE-260: Password in Configuration File
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product stores a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to actors who do not know the password.

### Extended Description
This can result in compromise of the system for which the password is used. An attacker could gain access to this file and learn the stored password or worse yet, change the password to one of their choosing.

### Alternative Terms
None
