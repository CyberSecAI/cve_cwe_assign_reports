# Critic Input for CVE-2021-20278



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Kiali in versions before 1.31.0 when the authentication strategy `OpenID` is used. When RBAC is enabled, Kiali assumes that some of the token validation is handled by the underlying cluster. When OpenID `implicit flow` is used with RBAC turned off, this token validation doesnt occur, and this allows a malicious user to bypass the authentication.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper token validation**
- **impact:** authentication bypass
- **vector:** OpenID implicit flow with RBAC off
- **attacker:** malicious user
- **product:** Kiali
- **version:** before 1.31.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Kiali's handling of the OpenID authentication strategy, specifically when using the "implicit flow" with RBAC disabled. Kiali relies on the underlying cluster to perform token validation when RBAC is enabled. However, when RBAC is off and OpenID "implicit flow" is in use, this validation doesn't occur, allowing for forged credentials to be used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that a malicious user can bypass Kiali's authentication mechanism.
- **Lack of Token Validation:** When using OpenID's implicit flow without RBAC, Kiali fails to perform proper token validation, which is a critical security weakness.
- **Assumption of Underlying Cluster Validation:** Kiali incorrectly assumes that the underlying cluster will handle token validation even when RBAC is disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to Kiali, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive information and other malicious activities.
- **Compromise of Kiali instance:**  Successful exploitation could grant access to Kiali's features and information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Forged Credentials:** Attackers can forge credentials that Kiali accepts when the described conditions are met.
- **Network-based attack:** Exploitation likely occurs through network requests directed at the vulnerable Kiali instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Kiali instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that Kiali is configured with `openid` authentication, using the `implicit flow` and that RBAC is disabled to craft the attack.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected versions:** Kiali versions 1.26.0, 1.26.1, 1.26.2, 1.27.0, 1.28.0, 1.28.1, 1.29.0, 1.29.1, and 1.30.0 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** Upgrading to Kiali v1.31.0 or later, or to specific fixed versions (1.26.3 or 1.29.2). Alternative mitigations include configuring Kiali to use the "authorization code" flow of the OpenID specification, enabling RBAC while using the implicit flow, or using another authentication method.

The provided information is more detailed than a basic CVE description, providing the specific conditions that make the vulnerability exploitable and mitigation strategies.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an **authentication bypass** due to **improper token validation** when using OpenID `implicit flow` with RBAC turned off. Kiali assumes the underlying cluster handles token validation, but this doesn't occur in the specified configuration. This maps directly to **CWE-304 (Missing Critical Step in Authentication)** because Kiali skips a crucial validation step, weakening the authentication process. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by highlighting the "Lack of Token Validation" as a key weakness. CWE-304 is a Base level CWE and the mapping guidance indicates that it is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)** is a broader category, CWE-304 is more specific as it pinpoints the missing step. Similarly, **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)** is relevant, but CWE-304 captures the nuance of skipping a step in an existing authentication process rather than the complete absence of authentication. CWE-304 is a child of CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* **CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel)** is also a relevant consideration. The vulnerability description mentions that when RBAC is off, the token validation doesn't occur, effectively creating an alternate path that bypasses the intended authentication. The CVE reference mentions forged credentials could be used. While the primary issue is the missing step, the result is an authentication bypass. The mapping guidance indicates that it is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-288 is related to CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel). It is a parent of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) which is a related but less specific weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Supporting evidence, but less direct than CWE-304)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)** is another plausible candidate, since the token validation is not occurring, resulting in a missing authentication check. However, CWE-304 more accurately captures the fact that there is an attempt to authenticate, but a critical step is missing, making the authentication process incomplete.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is a child of CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Less direct evidence compared to CWE-304 and CWE-288)

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.
