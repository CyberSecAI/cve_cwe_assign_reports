### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Mikrotik RouterOS
- **version:** 6.46.8, 6.47.9, and 6.47.10
- **component:** SCEP Server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41987:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies in the `base64Decode` function within `ScepRequest::parseRequest` in `/nova/lib/www/scep.p`.
* A miscalculation occurs during the Base64 decoding process when calculating the output buffer size. The formula `output_buffer_length = 3 * (input_buffer_length >> 2)` can result in an undersized buffer allocation. Specifically, when the input length is not a multiple of 4, the integer division (`>> 2` or `// 4`) will cause the buffer to be too small to hold the decoded data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The miscalculation in buffer allocation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when the decoded data exceeds the allocated buffer's size. This allows an attacker to overwrite heap metadata, specifically chunk sizes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By carefully crafting the Base64 encoded payload, an attacker can trigger the heap overflow, overwrite a vtable pointer, and gain control of execution flow. This enables them to execute arbitrary shellcode on the vulnerable Mikrotik router.
* **Privilege Escalation:** The provided exploit leads to the attacker being able to log into the web service as an administrator without a password.
* **Device compromise**: The shellcode used in the exploit reboots the target device after deleting the `/nova/store/user.data` file.

**Attack vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/scep` endpoint.
* **Specifically, the payload structure is**
   `GET /scep/{scep_server_name}?operation=PKIOperation&message={} HTTP/1.1\r\n`, with the `message` parameter containing the malicious base64 encoded data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Mikrotik router, specifically its WAN interface, because the attack can be performed without authentication.
* **Knowledge of `scep_server_name`:** The attacker must know the path name `scep_server_name` to successfully exploit the vulnerability. This implies some prior information gathering or potentially social engineering.
* **Payload crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious Base64 encoded payload that triggers the overflow and contains the shellcode.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit has low stability (5-6% success rate), potentially due to ASLR and other factors. However, the watchdog process restarts the vulnerable service (`www`) after a crash, which prevents denial of service and allows for multiple attempts.
* The provided technical analysis is more detailed than the typical CVE description. It includes decompiled code snippets, exploit flow overview, and steps to trigger the exploit.
* The document mentions specific affected versions: `6.46.8`, `6.47.9`, and `6.47.10`, which could be helpful when assessing the scope of the vulnerability.
* The exploit uses heap spraying to improve success rate by creating a predictable heap layout.
* The exploit uses a ROP chain to control the execution flow to the attacker's shellcode after the heap overflow.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states a **heap-based buffer overflow** in the SCEP Server of RouterOS. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that a miscalculation in the `base64Decode` function leads to an undersized buffer allocation, causing the overflow. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE, providing a specific classification for this type of buffer overflow. The MITRE mapping guidance allows its use. Also, the analysis indicates that the attacker can overwrite heap metadata, overwrite a vtable pointer, and gain control of execution flow, which aligns with the impact of heap overflows."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also related to other buffer overflow variants like CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The fact that it is heap-based makes CWE-122 the appropriate choice here."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence of a heap-based buffer overflow)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that the root cause is a miscalculation of the buffer size in the `base64Decode` function. The formula `output_buffer_length = 3 * (input_buffer_length >> 2)` is identified as the source of the error. This aligns with CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size), which describes the situation where a product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. The MITRE mapping guidance allows its use. This is a prerequisite weakness which then leads to CWE-122."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-131 is a base-level CWE that can lead to buffer overflows. It is related to CWE-122 because the incorrect calculation of the buffer size directly causes the heap-based buffer overflow."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium-High confidence as this is the root cause, but not as directly evident as the overflow itself.)

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When allocating a buffer for the purpose of transforming, converting, or encoding an input, allocate enough memory to handle the largest possible encoding. For example, in a routine that converts "&" characters to "&amp;" for HTML entity encoding, the output buffer needs to be at least 5 times as large as the input buffer.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Understand the programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, "not-a-number" calculations, and how the language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. [REF-7]


Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This is a broad category. Some examples include:


  - simple math errors,

  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,

  - not accounting for size differences when "transforming" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. "expansion").

This level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.

**[Maintenance]** 

This weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.


This issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed
- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
