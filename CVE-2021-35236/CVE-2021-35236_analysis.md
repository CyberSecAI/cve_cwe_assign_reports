# Analysis for CVE-2021-35236

```markdown
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE: Matches the specific weakness of missing Secure attribute in SSL cookie. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: Represents the broader risk of transmitting sensitive data in cleartext due to the missing Secure flag. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH


- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states the **rootcause** is the **lack of Secure flag in SSL Cookie**. This maps directly to CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute), which is a Variant-level CWE and is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance. The vulnerability occurs because the Secure attribute, which instructs the browser to only send the cookie over a secure HTTPS channel, is not set. Consequently, the cookie can be transmitted in cleartext over HTTP, as indicated by the description's **impact**: 'cookie can be sent in clear text'. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary candidate because it describes the broader issue of transmitting sensitive information without encryption, which is a consequence of the missing Secure flag. However, CWE-614 is more specific to the cookie issue."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-614 does not have any direct relationships mentioned in the provided information. However, CWE-319, a secondary candidate, is a parent of CWE-614. This means that CWE-614 is a specific instance of the more general weakness described by CWE-319. The fact that the vulnerability specifically involves a cookie lacking the Secure attribute makes CWE-614 the more appropriate choice."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to a clear match between the vulnerability description, CWE description, and MITRE mapping guidance)
