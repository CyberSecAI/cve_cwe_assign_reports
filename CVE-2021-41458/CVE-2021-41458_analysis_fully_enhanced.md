## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate a **stack buffer overflow** that leads to a denial of service due to a memory access violation within the `gf_blob_get` function. The program attempts to read from an invalid memory address, resulting in a segmentation fault (SEGV). This aligns with **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, which describes a product reading data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The ASAN report further supports this by detailing the memory access violation. This is the primary root cause of the vulnerability. Although the vulnerability description mentions a **stack buffer overflow**, the more precise issue is the out-of-bounds read occurring within the stack, making CWE-125 more appropriate as the primary CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While the initial description points to a stack buffer overflow, the analysis reveals an out-of-bounds read as the root cause. CWE-125 is a base-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-125 relates to CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), which is a variant, but the more general "out-of-bounds read" is more fitting initially.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials, including ASAN report and root cause analysis.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* Given that the initial description highlights a **stack buffer overflow**, **CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow)** is also considered. While the root cause is an out-of-bounds read, the context of a stack buffer increases the likelihood of this vulnerability leading to control-flow hijacking or arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites return addresses or function pointers on the stack. CWE-121 is a variant, and the description mentions stack.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant and is related to buffer overflows on the stack, hence its inclusion as a secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Supports the type of buffer and memory location where the overflow occurred.)



## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
