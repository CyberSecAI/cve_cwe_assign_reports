# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-35623

## Vulnerability Description
In Nordic nRF5 SDK for Mesh 5.0, a **heap overflow** vulnerability can be triggered by sending a series of segmented control packets and access packets with the same SeqAuth

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **vector:** series of segmented control packets and access packets with the same SeqAuth
- **product:** Nordic nRF5 SDK for Mesh
- **version:** 5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE-2022-35623?**

Yes, the title of the document mentions "Nordic Bluetooth Mesh SDK transport reassemble-heap overflow", which strongly suggests this document is related to CVE-2022-35623, since it refers to a heap overflow within the Nordic Bluetooth Mesh SDK, which is the official description of the CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap overflow during the reassembly of transport layer packets in the Nordic Bluetooth Mesh SDK.
*   **Weaknesses:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of memory allocation when reassembling transport layer packets. Specifically, the process of reassembling packets into larger messages likely fails to adequately validate the combined size of incoming segments, leading to a buffer overflow on the heap.
*   **Impact:** A heap overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing attackers to overwrite data structures used by the application or execute arbitrary code. This could cause a crash or denial of service, or in more severe scenarios allow for remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted Bluetooth Mesh packets designed to trigger the heap overflow in the reassembly buffer.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device and have the ability to send malicious Mesh packets. This generally implies physical proximity unless a relaying mechanism is involved.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document itself is not fully accessible since the JavaScript was disabled. However, the title provides the relevant information.
*   The term "transport reassemble" indicates that the vulnerability lies in the reassembly process of segmented mesh messages.

In summary, the document points to a heap overflow vulnerability in the Nordic Bluetooth Mesh SDK related to reassembling mesh transport packets, which is described by CVE-2022-35623. The overflow could lead to a denial of service or potentially remote code execution.
