|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability lies in the fact that encrypted cookie values are not tied to the name of the cookie. This allows an attacker to potentially reuse cookie values across different cookies if they have control over the content in a cookie. This directly relates to **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)** because without the cookie name binding, the encrypted value *could* be transmitted and used for other cookies, potentially revealing sensitive information if those other cookies are not properly secured. The CVE Reference mentions the exposure of plaintext values as well. Itâ€™s not clear if the sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext, but the weakness makes it vulnerable to it. The relationship analysis shows the exposure to plaintext values means that the cookie is not being used properly, which exposes the sensitive information. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-319 indicates this is ALLOWED for cases where sensitive data is transmitted without proper protection."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-319 is a Base level CWE. The vulnerability description states that the cookie's encrypted value could be exposed. The graph relationships show that this can lead to information disclosure."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability involves the encryption of cookie values without tying them to the cookie name. This could be seen as a form of **CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)** because the encryption process is incomplete and doesn't provide the necessary security guarantees, such as preventing replay attacks or unauthorized substitution. However, the primary issue is the lack of cookie name binding, making the encryption process vulnerable to the specific attack. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-327 indicates this is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW because it is a Class-level CWE."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-327 is a Class level CWE, and there may be a more specific child CWE. However, without more details about the encryption algorithm, this is the closest match."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.40 (Low evidence because it's a potential related issue, but not the primary weakness)
