| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **buffer overread** which occurs when parsing a specially crafted STUN message with an unknown attribute. The provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states that the **root cause** is a **buffer over-read** in the STUN message decoder due to the code not correctly validating the length of the attribute value. This leads to reading beyond the allocated buffer. Therefore, CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is the primary weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-126 indicates this is ALLOWED. The code's failure to validate the length of the attribute value also suggests CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) as a secondary weakness, because the code doesn't properly validate the size or length of the input STUN message attribute.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a Variant of the Class CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 is a Base level weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
