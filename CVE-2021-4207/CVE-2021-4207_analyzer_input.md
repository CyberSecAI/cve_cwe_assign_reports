# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-4207

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A **double fetch of guest controlled values** `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent **heap-based buffer overflow**. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **double fetch of guest controlled values**
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** crash the QEMU process on the host and potentially execute arbitrary code
- **attacker:** malicious privileged guest user
- **product:** QEMU
- **component:** QXL display device emulation
