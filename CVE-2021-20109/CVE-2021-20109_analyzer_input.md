# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-20109

## Vulnerability Description
Due to the Asset Explorer agent not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorers Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agents HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then **heap overflow** will occur.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **product:** Asset Explorer agent
- **component:** AEAgent.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap overflow in the ManageEngine Asset Explorer agent (AEAgent.cpp). Specifically, the agent's HTTP response handling is flawed when processing a large POST payload. The payload is converted to Unicode using `vswprintf` and written to a fixed-size buffer of 0x2000 bytes. If the POST payload is larger than this buffer, a heap overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap overflow caused by insufficient buffer size to accommodate the converted POST payload.
*   **Lack of HTTPS Certificate Validation:** The agent does not validate HTTPS certificates, allowing an attacker to impersonate the Asset Explorer server by configuring a matching IP address.
*   **Insecure Authtoken Handling:** The agent sends its authtoken over HTTP, allowing it to be intercepted by an attacker who has positioned themselves as a MITM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although the provided text does not explicitly state it, heap overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical memory regions. This is a typical consequence of successful heap overflow exploitation.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the agent's behavior, potentially compromising the integrity of scanned assets data.
*   **Man-in-the-middle attack:** An attacker on the network can send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent and intercept the agent's authtoken.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Asset Explorer agent can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Man-in-the-middle:** An attacker can perform a MITM attack by impersonating the Asset Explorer server.
*   **Malicious POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted `NEWSCAN` request with an excessively large POST payload to trigger the heap overflow on a vulnerable agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable ManageEngine Asset Explorer agent.
*   **IP Address Spoofing:** The attacker needs the capability to statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer server's IP address, which is a pre-requisite to sending a malicious NEWSCAN request.
*   **Understanding of the Protocol:** The attacker must know how to form a `NEWSCAN` request to the asset explorer agent and how to structure the POST payload to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was found in Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent version 1.0.34.
*   Tenable disclosed the issue to ManageEngine on March 26, 2021 and publicly released the information on July 16, 2021, with the vendor having issued a patch during that time.
*   The vulnerability is rated as High severity.
*   CVSS v2 score is 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:N)
*   CVSS v3 score is 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)
