# Critic Input for CVE-2022-46155



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Airtable.js is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version 0.11.6, Airtable.js had a **misconfigured build script** in its source package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically, the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set in users environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of the following conditions are met 1) the user has cloned the Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm prepare` script, and 3) the user has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable set. If these conditions are met, a users local build of Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher or, as a workaround unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as the keysy may be present in bundled code.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **misconfigured build script**
- **weakness:** **inclusion of sensitive information in build target**
- **product:** Airtable.js
- **version:** prior to 0.11.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A misconfigured build script in the `airtable.js` package was bundling environment variables into the browser build. Specifically, `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL` were being included in the generated bundle when referenced in the code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Credentials Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintentional inclusion of the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` within the browser build of the library, potentially exposing sensitive API keys.
*   **Build Process Misconfiguration:** The core issue stems from the build script's failure to properly exclude environment variables during the bundling process, which was using `envify` to inject the environment variables.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized API access:** If the bundled `airtable.js` code containing the API key is distributed, attackers could extract the key and gain unauthorized access to the corresponding Airtable account.
*   **Data Breach/Modification:** With access to the API key, attackers could potentially view, modify, or delete data stored in the associated Airtable base.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Accidental Distribution of Bundled Code:** The primary attack vector involves a developer who cloned the `airtable.js` source code, ran the `npm prepare` script (triggering the problematic build process), and then inadvertently distributed the modified bundle containing the API key (e.g., by including it in their website or application).
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (Potentially):** While less likely, an attacker who could intercept the distribution channel might also be able to access the bundled javascript and extract the API key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to a copy of the modified `airtable.js` code bundled by a developer who cloned the repository, ran the build script with the environment variable set.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability only affects developers who build `airtable.js` from the source using `npm prepare` with the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable set. Users who install `airtable.js` through npm or yarn are not affected.
*   The fix involves modifying the build script to explicitly mask out the environment variables `AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL` and `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` using the `envify` transform by setting them to empty strings during the build process.
*   The fixed version of the package is `0.11.6`.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to `airtable.js` version `0.11.6` or higher, unsetting the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable, and regenerating any Airtable API keys that were used during affected builds.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
*   CVSS v3 base metrics are: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H which translates to: Network Attack Vector, High Attack Complexity, High Privileges Required, User Interaction Required, Scope Changed, High Confidentiality, High Integrity, High Availability

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves a **misconfigured build script** that inadvertently bundles the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable into the build output, leading to **exposure of sensitive information**. This aligns well with CWE-526, "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable," because the API key, a sensitive credential, which is stored in the environment variables and included in the build artifact without proper protection. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary explicitly state that the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable is bundled into the built `airtable.js` file. This is a clear example of storing sensitive information (the API key) in an environment variable and then including it in cleartext in the final product. CWE-526 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-526 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-526 has no direct relationships, but it can be considered a specific case of more general weaknesses related to information exposure. It is related to the broader issue of credentials management and secure coding practices. The environment variable itself is not the problem, but rather the inclusion of its value within the built artifact.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and alignment with CWE characteristics)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-201, "Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data," is a potential secondary candidate because the bundled `airtable.js` file, containing the API key, is essentially "sent" (distributed) to users or systems where it should not be accessible. This aligns with the CWE's description: "The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor." While the primary issue is the storage and inclusion of the API key in the environment variable and build output (CWE-526), the distribution of this output containing the key can be seen as an instance of CWE-201. However, it is the direct consequence of CWE-526, making CWE-526 the root cause. CWE-201 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-201 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-201 is related to weaknesses like CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) and CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse). The relationship analysis reveals that CWE-212 could be a related weakness because the sensitive information wasn't removed before the build process bundled the environment variable.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence, primarily as a consequence of the primary weakness)

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Specify which data in the software should be regarded as sensitive. Consider which types of users should have access to which types of data.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that any possibly sensitive data specified in the requirements is verified with designers to ensure that it is either a calculated risk or mitigated elsewhere. Any information that is not necessary to the functionality should be removed in order to lower both the overhead and the possibility of security sensitive data being sent.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** System Configuration
- **Description:** Setup default error messages so that unexpected errors do not disclose sensitive information.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Resources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.


For example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Clearly specify which information should be regarded as private or sensitive, and require that the product offers functionality that allows the user to cleanse the sensitive information from the resource before it is published or exported to other parties.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Use naming conventions and strong types to make it easier to spot when sensitive data is being used. When creating structures, objects, or other complex entities, separate the sensitive and non-sensitive data as much as possible.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.

**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Terminology]** The terms "cleansing" and "scrubbing" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).
- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** During critical state transitions, information not needed in the next state should be removed or overwritten with fixed patterns (such as all 0's) or random data, before the transition to the next state.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** When releasing, de-allocating, or deleting a resource, overwrite its data and relevant metadata with fixed patterns or random data. Be cautious about complex resource types whose underlying representation might be non-contiguous or change at a low level, such as how a file might be split into different chunks on a file system, even though "logical" file positions are contiguous at the application layer. Such resource types might require invocation of special modes or APIs to tell the underlying operating system to perform the necessary clearing, such as SDelete (Secure Delete) on Windows, although the appropriate functionality might not be available at the application layer.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used



## CWE-526: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an environment variable to store unencrypted sensitive information.

### Extended Description
Information stored in an environment variable can be accessible by other processes with the execution context, including child processes that dependencies are executed in, or serverless functions in cloud environments. An environment variable's contents can also be inserted into messages, headers, log files, or other outputs. Often these other dependencies have no need to use the environment variable in question. A weakness that discloses environment variables could expose this information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-312
PeerOf -> CWE-214

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Encrypt information stored in the environment variable to protect it from being exposed to an unauthorized user. If encryption is not feasible or is considered too expensive for the business use of the application, then consider using a properly protected configuration file instead of an environment variable. It should be understood that unencrypted information in a config file is also not guaranteed to be protected, but it is still a better choice, because it reduces attack surface related to weaknesses such as CWE-214. In some settings, vaults might be a feasible option for safer data transfer. Users should be notified of the business choice made to not protect the sensitive information through encryption.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If the environment variable is not necessary for the desired behavior, then remove it entirely, or clear it to an empty value.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-43691:** CMS shows sensitive server-side information from environment variables when run in Debug mode.
- **CVE-2022-27195:** Plugin for an automation server inserts environment variable contents into build XML files.
- **CVE-2022-25264:** CI/CD tool logs environment variables related to passwords add Contribution to content history.
