**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the input that the software uses to construct a code segment.
- The attacker would require network access to the affected device.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the presence of a **hard-coded password** used for inbound authentication or outbound communication. CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is a Variant-level CWE that precisely matches this description. The "Retriever Results" also identify CWE-259 as the top candidate, further reinforcing this choice. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is a more general Base-level CWE, and while applicable, CWE-259 provides a more specific characterization of the weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary does not contain any information related to the root cause or weakness, but the vulnerability description itself provides sufficient evidence. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-259 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-259 is a child of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). This parent-child relationship supports the selection of CWE-259 due to its higher level of specificity.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match with the vulnerability description and retriever results.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1391
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-344
ChildOf -> CWE-671
PeerOf -> CWE-257
ParentOf -> CWE-259
ParentOf -> CWE-321

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access



## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.
