# Critic Input for CVE-2021-35973



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
NETGEAR WAC104 devices before 1.0.4.15 are affected by an **authentication bypass vulnerability** in /usr/sbin/mini_httpd, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to invoke any action by adding the &currentsetting.htm substring to the HTTP query, a related issue to CVE-2020-27866. This directly allows the attacker to change the web UI password, and eventually to enable debug mode (telnetd) and gain a shell on the device as the admin limited-user account (however, escalation to root is simple because of weak permissions on the /etc/ directory).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass vulnerability**
- **impact:** change web UI password, enable debug mode, gain a shell
- **vector:** adding &currentsetting.htm substring to HTTP query
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** NETGEAR WAC104 devices
- **version:** before 1.0.4.15
- **component:** /usr/sbin/mini_httpd

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a combination of multiple vulnerabilities in the NETGEAR WAC104 access point's firmware. The vulnerabilities, when chained together, allow an attacker to gain a root shell on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **HTTP Authentication Bypass (mini\_httpd):**
    *   The device uses a flag to skip authentication checks based on certain conditions in the HTTP request.
    *   The flag is set when specific substrings ("setupwizard.cgi", "currentsetting.htm") or a specific SOAPAction header are found in the request URI or headers.
    *   The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication by inserting a null byte (`%00`) before "currentsetting.htm" in the URI or by adding `currentsetting.htm` as a query parameter.
    *   This bypass grants access to any CGI script through a GET request.

2.  **.bss section Buffer Overflow in HTTP header processing (mini\_httpd):**
    *   A buffer overflow exists in the processing of the "SOAPAction:" HTTP header.
    *   The code copies data from the header into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
    *   This vulnerability is considered less exploitable because it causes the server to exit early. However, it may be possible to exploit it to obtain read/write capabilities.

3.  **Unverified Password Change (setup.cgi):**
    *   The `setup.cgi` script has an action (`con_save_passwd`) that allows changing the admin password in NVRAM without requiring the old password.
    *   This action is accessible via GET requests, and does not have CSRF protection.
    *   The password change needs a reboot to propagate to /etc/passwd and /etc/htpasswd files.

4.  **Session ID Verification Bypass (setup.cgi):**
    *   `setup.cgi` checks if a session ID in a POST request matches the ID stored in a session file.
    *   The file name is derived from the `sp` parameter in the request, and can be manipulated.
    *   If the session file does not exist the function returns 0. This allows an attacker to send `id=0&sp=ABC` and bypass the session check.
    *   The session ID is 32 bits, which is easily brute-forcible.

5.  **/tmp/etc Directory Permission Issue:**
    *   The `/tmp/etc` directory has permissions set to 777.
    *   Although `admin` user cannot modify `/etc/passwd` directly, they can rename it due to the directory permissions. This allows them to add a new user with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain a root shell on the device.
*   The device can be completely taken over.
*   Allows for full control over the device and network.
*   Can be used for further attacks or lateral movement inside the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LAN-based attack:** An attacker within the same local network can exploit the vulnerabilities directly via HTTP.
*   **Internet-based reflected attack:** An attacker can trick a user on the LAN to visit a malicious website. This website can then send HTTP requests to the router to exploit the auth bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **LAN-based attacker:** Must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Internet-based reflected attack:** Needs to lure a user on the LAN to visit a malicious website or cause them to open a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a missed variant of a previously known vulnerability in other NETGEAR devices.
*   The exploit chain involves multiple steps, such as bypassing authentication, changing the password, and exploiting the directory permission issue to gain root privileges.
*   The report also includes a proof-of-concept exploit in Python.
*   The device firmware code quality was deemed poor.
*   The advisory also mentions the WNDR3700v5 model might be vulnerable, but no fix is coming.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is an **authentication bypass vulnerability**. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to invoke actions by adding a specific substring to the HTTP query, which directly leads to changing the web UI password and enabling debug mode to gain a shell. The core issue is the **missing authentication** for critical functions. Therefore, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is the most appropriate primary mapping because it precisely describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" clearly indicates that the device uses a flag to skip authentication checks based on conditions in the HTTP request, bypassing authentication and granting access to CGI scripts. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-306 indicates this is ALLOWED and it's at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is related to CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel), as the bypass leads to missing authentication. However, CWE-306 more directly addresses the **root cause**. CWE-288 is considered a secondary candidate because the vulnerability utilizes a specific alternate path ("&currentsetting.htm" substring) to bypass authentication. The graph relationship shows that CWE-306 is a child of CWE-288. Also, CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is added as a secondary candidate because weak permissions on the `/etc/` directory leads to easy escalation to root, which can be a result of hard-coded credentials or default settings. This is a less direct relationship, hence the lower confidence.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.



### Alternative Terms
None

ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-344
ChildOf -> CWE-671

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.
