## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability, identified as PSV-2021-0128, affecting multiple router models. Although the document doesn't mention CVE-2021-45607, the advisory provides similar details related to vulnerability analysis, which is a useful data point.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the listed Netgear router models. The vulnerability is triggered after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the affected device, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The CVSS score of 6.8 indicates a medium severity with high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), indicating the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the router's management interface before exploiting the stack overflow. The required privileges are high (PR:H), and no user interaction is required (UI:N).
