## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.00
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the root cause. The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by stating "Root cause of vulnerability: - Use-after-free in Swiftshader." CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a Variant-level CWE that perfectly matches this description. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-416 as the primary candidate, and its usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE's mapping guidance. The impact of the vulnerability, "heap corruption", is a typical consequence of use-after-free conditions.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). The use after free condition can lead to other vulnerabilities.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.00 (Explicit evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)
