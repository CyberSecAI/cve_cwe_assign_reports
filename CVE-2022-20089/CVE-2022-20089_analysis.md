## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **root cause** is "**active debug code**" which leads to "**memory corruption**". The summary of CVE-2022-20089 confirms "**Active debug code in the aee driver**" as the root cause. This aligns directly with CWE-489 (Active Debug Code). The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-489 indicates it is ALLOWED. While other CWEs like CWE-416 (Use After Free) were suggested, CWE-489 is the most direct and accurate representation of the **root cause**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found for CWE-489. The primary weakness is the presence of active debug code. While the presence of debug code leads to memory corruption, that is a symptom or an impact of the debug code being present, not the primary weakness itself.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct mention of "active debug code" as the root cause in both the vulnerability description and the CVE summary.)
