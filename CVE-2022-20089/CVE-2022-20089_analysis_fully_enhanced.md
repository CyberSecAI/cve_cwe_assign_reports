# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-20089

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-489 | Active Debug Code | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.5 | Variant | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **root cause** is "**active debug code**" which leads to "**memory corruption**". The summary of CVE-2022-20089 confirms "**Active debug code in the aee driver**" as the root cause. This aligns directly with CWE-489 (Active Debug Code). The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-489 indicates it is ALLOWED. While other CWEs like CWE-416 (Use After Free) were suggested, CWE-489 is the most direct and accurate representation of the **root cause**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found for CWE-489. The primary weakness is the presence of active debug code. While the presence of debug code leads to memory corruption, that is a symptom or an impact of the debug code being present, not the primary weakness itself.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct mention of "active debug code" as the root cause in both the vulnerability description and the CVE summary.)



## Known Examples for CWE-489: Active Debug Code
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-38179**: Debug function of Admin UI of SAP Business One Integration is enabled by default. This allows Admin User to see the captured packet contents which may include User credentials.
- **CVE-2021-23861**: By executing a special command, an user with administrative rights can get access to extended debug functionality on the VRM allowing an impact on integrity or availability of the installed software. This issue also affects installations of the DIVAR IP and BVMS with VRM installed.
- **CVE-2022-20089**: In aee driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to active debug code. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06240397; Issue ID: ALPS06240397.
- **CVE-2022-33323**: Active Debug Code vulnerability in robot controller of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation industrial robot MELFA SD/SQ Series and MELFA F-Series allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access by authentication bypass through an unauthorized telnet login. As for the affected model names, controller types and firmware versions, see the Mitsubishi Electric's advisory which is listed in [References] section.
- **CVE-2021-28112**: Draeger X-Dock Firmware before 03.00.13 has Active Debug Code on a debug port, leading to remote code execution by an authenticated attacker.
- **CVE-2022-36348**: Active debug code in some Intel (R) SPS firmware before version SPS_E5_04.04.04.300.0 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.
- **CVE-2022-24797**: Pomerium is an identity-aware access proxy. In distributed service mode, Pomerium's Authenticate service exposes pprof debug and prometheus metrics handlers to untrusted traffic. This can leak potentially sensitive environmental information or lead to limited denial of service conditions. This issue is patched in version v0.17.1 Workarounds: Block access to `/debug` and `/metrics` paths on the authenticate service. This can be done with any L7 proxy, including Pomerium's own proxy service.
