# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-41213

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-663 | Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves a non-reentrant lock causing deadlocks in a concurrent context. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **rootcause** is the use of a **non-reentrant Lock Python object**. This directly leads to a deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually recursive. The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` further reinforces this by explaining that the `threading.Lock` object, which is not re-entrant, prevents the same thread from acquiring the lock multiple times in recursive calls, causing a deadlock. This aligns precisely with CWE-663, which describes the "Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context." The fix mentioned in the description, replacing `threading.Lock` with `threading.RLock`, further validates this mapping, as `RLock` is re-entrant and resolves the deadlock issue. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-663 indicates this is ALLOWED, reinforcing the appropriateness of this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct parent-child relationships, CWE-663 is related to concurrency issues and resource management. The deadlock can be considered a consequence of improper concurrency control.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference details, and proposed fix.)



## Known Examples for CWE-663: Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1349** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1349](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1349): unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler
- **CVE-2004-2259** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2259](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2259): SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-41213**: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the code behind `tf.function` API can be made to deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually recursive. This occurs due to using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object. Loading any model which contains mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although this is not a frequent scenario. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2020-19765**: An issue in the noReentrance() modifier of the Ethereum-based contract Accounting 1.0 allows attackers to carry out a reentrancy attack.
