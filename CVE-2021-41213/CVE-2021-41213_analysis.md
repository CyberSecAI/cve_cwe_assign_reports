# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-663 | Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves a non-reentrant lock causing deadlocks in a concurrent context. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **rootcause** is the use of a **non-reentrant Lock Python object**. This directly leads to a deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually recursive. The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` further reinforces this by explaining that the `threading.Lock` object, which is not re-entrant, prevents the same thread from acquiring the lock multiple times in recursive calls, causing a deadlock. This aligns precisely with CWE-663, which describes the "Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context." The fix mentioned in the description, replacing `threading.Lock` with `threading.RLock`, further validates this mapping, as `RLock` is re-entrant and resolves the deadlock issue. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-663 indicates this is ALLOWED, reinforcing the appropriateness of this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct parent-child relationships, CWE-663 is related to concurrency issues and resource management. The deadlock can be considered a consequence of improper concurrency control.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference details, and proposed fix.)
