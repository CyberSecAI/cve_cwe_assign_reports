# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-41213

## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the code behind `tf.function` API can be made to deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually recursive. This occurs due to using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object. Loading any model which contains mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although this is not a frequent scenario. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **non-reentrant Lock Python object**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **vector:** loading any model which contains mutually recursive functions
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **version:** affected versions
- **component:** tf.function API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-reentrant `threading.Lock` object within the `tf.function` API. This lock prevents mutually recursive `tf.function` decorated Python functions from executing correctly, leading to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Non-reentrant Lock:** The core issue is the usage of `threading.Lock`, which cannot be acquired multiple times by the same thread. In mutually recursive functions, the same thread attempts to acquire the lock multiple times, causing a deadlock.
- **Deadlock:** Mutually recursive calls to `tf.function` trigger a deadlock because the lock isn't re-entrant.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can create a model with mutually recursive `tf.function` calls. When a user attempts to load and execute this model, the deadlock will lead to a denial of service as the program hangs indefinitely.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Model Loading:** An attacker can craft a TensorFlow model containing mutually recursive functions wrapped with `@tf.function`.
- **Invocation of Recursive Function:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user loads the malicious model and calls a recursive `tf.function` decorated function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Model Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a TensorFlow model or have the ability to modify an existing one.
- **Model Distribution:** The attacker needs to be able to distribute the malicious model to a target user to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix replaces the non-reentrant `threading.Lock` with a re-entrant `threading.RLock`. The `threading.RLock` allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times without causing a deadlock.

*   The vulnerability impacts TensorFlow versions prior to 2.7.0 and is fixed in versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, and 2.6.1.

*   The provided code snippet illustrates how the deadlock can be triggered using two mutually recursive functions decorated with `@tf.function`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function()
def fun1(num):
    if num == 1:
        return
    print(num)
    fun2(num-1)

@tf.function()
def fun2(num):
    if num == 0:
        return
    print(num)
    fun1(num-1)

fun1(9)
```

*   The commit `afac8158d43691661ad083f6dd9e56f327c1dcb7` specifically addresses this issue by replacing `threading.Lock` with `threading.RLock` in `def_function.py` and `function.py`.

This detailed information provides a thorough understanding of the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how it can be exploited and mitigated.
