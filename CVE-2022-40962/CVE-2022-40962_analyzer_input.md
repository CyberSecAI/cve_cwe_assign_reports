# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-40962

## Vulnerability Description
Mozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Sebastian Hengst, Andreas Pehrson, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported **memory safety bugs** present in Firefox 104 and Firefox ESR 102.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory safety bugs**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **product:** Firefox ESR and Thunderbird and Firefox
- **version:** < 102.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-40962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
