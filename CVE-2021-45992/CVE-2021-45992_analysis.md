# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** in the `formSetQvlanList` function of Tenda routers, directly caused by the `qvlanName` parameter. This aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which describes a condition where a buffer allocated on the stack is overwritten. The **root cause** is the lack of proper size validation for the `qvlanName` parameter before copying it to a stack-allocated buffer, which results in an **out-of-bounds write**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by mentioning the stack overflow vulnerability in `formSetQvlanList` and the crafted `qvlanName` parameter as the attack vector. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered a secondary candidate because it describes the general condition of writing outside the intended buffer, but CWE-121 is more specific since the buffer is on the stack. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as a stack overflow is a type of out-of-bounds write.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack overflow" and the description of the vulnerable component and parameter)
