## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in Dev Tools," which directly aligns with CWE-416 (Use After Free). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms "**Use after free**" as the root cause. CWE-416 describes the condition where a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed, which perfectly matches the vulnerability. The vulnerability can lead to **heap corruption**, crash, or arbitrary code execution, further validating the mapping to CWE-416. The 'Retriever Results' also strongly suggest CWE-416 as the primary candidate with the highest combined score. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. Although it has relationships with parent CWEs like CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release), CWE-416 is more specific and accurately represents the **use-after-free** condition.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of "use after free" in both the vulnerability description and CVE reference details, along with high retriever scores)
