# Critic Input for CVE-2022-39218



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
The JS Compute Runtime for Fastlys Compute@Edge platform provides the environment JavaScript is executed in when using the Compute@Edge JavaScript SDK. In versions prior to 0.5.3, the `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` methods fail to use sufficiently random values. The initial value to seed the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module, making the sequence of random values for that specific WebAssembly module predictable. An attacker can use the fixed seed to predict random numbers generated by these functions and bypass cryptographic security controls, for example to disclose sensitive data encrypted by functions that use these generators. The problem has been patched in version 0.5.3. No known workarounds exist.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **fixed seed for PRNG**
- **impact:** bypass cryptographic security controls
- **product:** Fastly's Compute@Edge platform
- **version:** prior to 0.5.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The initial seed for the CSPRNG used by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was baked into the WebAssembly module during compilation due to the use of Wizer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable random number generation. The sequence of numbers generated by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was predictable because the seed for the CSPRNG was fixed during compilation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the WebAssembly module could predict the random numbers generated by these functions. This could be used to bypass cryptographic security controls and potentially disclose sensitive data encrypted by functions using these generators.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs access to the specific WebAssembly module where the affected functions are called.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the WebAssembly module that utilizes the vulnerable random number generation methods.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is a **fixed seed for the PRNG**, specifically in the `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` methods in the JS Compute Runtime for Fastly's Compute@Edge platform. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating that "the initial seed for the CSPRNG used by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was baked into the WebAssembly module during compilation". This aligns perfectly with CWE-336, "Same Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)," which is a Variant-level CWE and is ALLOWED according to MITRE's mapping guidance. The impact of this **weakness** is that an attacker can predict random numbers and bypass cryptographic security controls.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-336 is a variant of CWE-335 (Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)). While CWE-335 is also a potential candidate, CWE-336 is more specific because the seed is the same every time. CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-336, but it's less specific and therefore less appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the explicit description of the fixed seed and the direct match with CWE-336).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) is a Class-level CWE that encompasses the broader issue of using weak or predictable random numbers. While CWE-336 is a more precise classification, CWE-330 can be considered as a secondary candidate because the **fixed seed** leads to insufficiently random values. However, because CWE-336 captures the specific mechanism, it is the primary CWE. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-330 is "Discouraged" because it is a Class, and more specific children might be more appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-330 is a parent of CWE-336, indicating that the specific weakness (fixed seed) falls under the broader category of using insufficiently random values.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence, as CWE-330 represents a higher-level view of the issue).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) could also be considered, but the vulnerability description explicitly states the seed is the *same*, which is more precisely captured by CWE-336, rather than merely predictable. This is a subtle but important distinction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-337 is a variant of CWE-335, similar to CWE-336. The choice between them hinges on the specific details in the vulnerability description, and here, the fixed seed leads to choosing CWE-336.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence, as while the seed is predictable, the primary issue is that it's consistently the *same*).

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32033**: Protectimus SLIM NFC 70 10.01 devices allow a Time Traveler attack in which attackers can predict TOTP passwords in certain situations. The time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value for generating time-based one-time passwords, without authentication. Thus, an attacker with short-time physical access to a device can set the internal real-time clock (RTC) to the future, generate one-time passwords, and reset the clock to the current time. This allows the generation of valid future time-based one-time passwords without having further access to the hardware token.
- **CVE-2022-29965**: The Emerson DeltaV Distributed Control System (DCS) controllers and IO cards through 2022-04-29 misuse passwords. Access to privileged operations on the maintenance port TELNET interface (23/TCP) on M-series and SIS (CSLS/LSNB/LSNG) nodes is controlled by means of utility passwords. These passwords are generated using a deterministic, insecure algorithm using a single seed value composed of a day/hour/minute timestamp with less than 16 bits of entropy. The seed value is fed through a lookup table and a series of permutation operations resulting in three different four-character passwords corresponding to different privilege levels. An attacker can easily reconstruct these passwords and thus gain access to privileged maintenance operations. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2014-2350.
- **CVE-2022-31008**: RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions: `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.
- **CVE-2022-31034**: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v0.11.0 are vulnerable to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from the Argo CD CLI or UI. The vulnerabilities are due to the use of insufficiently random values in parameters in Oauth2/OIDC login flows. In each case, using a relatively-predictable (time-based) seed in a non-cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator made the parameter less random than required by the relevant spec or by general best practices. In some cases, using too short a value made the entropy even less sufficient. The attacks on login flows which are meant to be mitigated by these parameters are difficult to accomplish but can have a high impact potentially granting an attacker admin access to Argo CD. Patches for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: v2.4.1, v2.3.5, v2.2.10 and v2.1.16. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2022-42159**: D-Link COVR 1200,1202,1203 v1.08 was discovered to have a predictable seed in a Pseudo-Random Number Generator.


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is initialized from a predictable seed, such as the process ID or system time.

### Extended Description
The use of predictable seeds significantly reduces the number of possible seeds that an attacker would need to test in order to predict which random numbers will be generated by the PRNG.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-335

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Description:** Use non-predictable inputs for seed generation.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Requirements
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems, or use the more recent FIPS 140-3 [REF-1192] if possible.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Use a PRNG that periodically re-seeds itself using input from high-quality sources, such as hardware devices with high entropy. However, do not re-seed too frequently, or else the entropy source might block.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2019-11495:** server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds
- **CVE-2008-0166:** The removal of a couple lines of code caused Debian's OpenSSL Package to only use the current process ID for seeding a PRNG



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

### Extended Description
When product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
None

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Use a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and select well-tested implementations with adequate length seeds.


In general, if a pseudo-random number generator is not advertised as being cryptographically secure, then it is probably a statistical PRNG and should not be used in security-sensitive contexts.


Pseudo-random number generators can produce predictable numbers if the generator is known and the seed can be guessed. A 256-bit seed is a good starting point for producing a "random enough" number.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Consider a PRNG that re-seeds itself as needed from high quality pseudo-random output sources, such as hardware devices.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Testing
- **Description:** Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.



## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

### Extended Description


 PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.


 Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: 


  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); 

  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source 

 PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. 

 Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

- **CVE-2018-12520:** Product's PRNG is not seeded for the generation of session IDs



## CWE-336: Same Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) uses the same seed each time the product is initialized.

### Extended Description
Given the deterministic nature of PRNGs, using the same seed for each initialization will lead to the same output in the same order. If an attacker can guess (or knows) the seed, then the attacker may be able to determine the random numbers that will be produced from the PRNG.

### Alternative Terms
None

ChildOf -> CWE-335
