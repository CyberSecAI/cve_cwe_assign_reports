# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41011

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the schedule link1 WORD link2 WORD policy (failover|backup) description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with format strings and command parameters without checking the size of the input parameters against the size of the stack buffer, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted network packet sent to the device's `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The CVSS score indicates that an attacker needs high privileges on the device to exploit this vulnerability."
