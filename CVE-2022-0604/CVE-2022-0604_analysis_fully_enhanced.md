# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.6 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" in Google Chrome's Tab Groups. This directly aligns with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of buffer overflow occurring in the heap memory. The description also mentions "**heap corruption**", which can be a consequence of a heap overflow, further supporting the selection of CWE-122 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also suggest CWE-122 as a relevant candidate, with a decent score, though lower than other potential candidates. Given the explicit mention of "heap buffer overflow" in both the description and CVE summary, CWE-122 is the most appropriate primary mapping.

  - *Explanation:* CWE-416 (Use After Free) is also considered as a secondary candidate because **heap corruption** could lead to a use-after-free condition if the freed memory is reallocated and then accessed by the original pointer. Although the primary description focuses on the overflow, the potential for use-after-free makes CWE-416 a plausible secondary weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-416 is related to memory management issues and can be a consequence of memory corruption caused by other vulnerabilities like CWE-122.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence for CWE-122 due to the explicit mention of "heap buffer overflow" and "heap corruption" in the description and CVE summary.)
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence for CWE-416 as a secondary weakness, given that heap corruption can lead to use-after-free conditions, but is not explicitly stated.)

## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples

- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
