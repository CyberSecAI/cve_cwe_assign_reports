# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-41198

## Query
Due to lack of proper memory management, when a victim opens a manipulated SketchUp (.skp, SketchUp.x3d) file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer - version 9, it is possible that a Remote Code Execution can be triggered when payload forces a stack-based overflow or a re-use of dangling pointer which refers to overwritten space in memory.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: improper memory management
