# Critic Input for CVE-2022-23613



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In affected versions an **integer underflow** leading to a **heap overflow** in the sesman server allows any unauthenticated attacker which is able to locally access a sesman server to execute code as root. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.18.1 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23613

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow in the `sesman_data_in` function of the xrdp-sesman server. This underflow occurs when validating the size of the incoming data, leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Integer Underflow (CWE-191):** The size check `if (size < HEADER_SIZE || size > self->in_s->size)` is vulnerable to integer underflow. When a small size is provided such that `size < HEADER_SIZE`, the check can become true even when the size is negative or very large.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The integer underflow leads to `self->header_size` being set to a very large value, causing a heap overflow when data is processed using this size, because it bypasses the size check and then copies too much data to the allocated buffer.
*   **Improper Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-130, CWE-839):** There's improper calculation of the buffer size due to the integer underflow. The code doesn't correctly handle the case where a small or negative value is passed as the size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the sesman server to achieve root code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the sesman server, which by default listens on localhost, but may be configured for remote access.
*   **Malicious RDP Client:** An attacker can use a malicious or crafted RDP client to send a specially crafted message to the sesman server, triggering the integer underflow and subsequent heap overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target sesman server.
*   **Low Privileges:** No specific privileges are required, as the vulnerability occurs before authentication takes place.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required. The attacker simply needs to send the malicious message to the vulnerable server.
*   **Local Attack Vector** Although the sesman server might listen only locally, it is still labeled as "local attack vector" in the CVSS v3 metrics. This does not mean the attack is limited to only local attackers. This "local" designation is because the vulnerability does not exist in the client software used to connect, but on the service running locally.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in xrdp versions 0.9.17 and 0.9.18.
*   The fix is included in versions 0.9.18.1 or 0.9.19 and above.
*   The patch adds a lower bound check to the size validation `if (size < HEADER_SIZE || size > self->in_s->size)` to prevent an integer underflow, so now it explicitly checks `if (size < HEADER_SIZE)` instead of implicitly assuming the size cannot be a small number.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gilad Kleinman.

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root, making it a serious security concern.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that an **integer underflow** leads to a **heap overflow**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions **Integer Underflow (CWE-191)** as a key weakness, occurring in the size check.  The underflow leads to incorrect buffer size calculation which results in a **heap overflow**. Given the direct causality, both CWEs are relevant. CWE-191 is the root cause, while CWE-122 is the direct consequence.  MITRE mapping guidance allows both CWEs.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-191 is a Base-level CWE and accurately represents the integer underflow condition. CWE-122 is a Variant of buffer overflow specifically related to the heap. The vulnerability description and CVE summary describe the integer underflow, making CWE-191 most appropriate as the root cause. CWE-122 accurately represents the overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Description:** Pre-design: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.
