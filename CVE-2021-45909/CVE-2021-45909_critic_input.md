### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** gif2apng
- **version:** 1.9
- **component:** DecodeLZW function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-45909

**Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the `DecodeLZW` function within the `gif2apng` tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The `DecodeLZW` function writes data to a buffer allocated with `malloc`, but it doesn't validate the size of the data written against the allocated buffer's size.
*  The size of the allocated buffer is initially calculated based on an image size value (`imagesize * 2`), however, this `imagesize` variable is later overwritten, so the `DecodeLZW` function doesn't have access to the actual allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption.
*   The overflow allows writing an arbitrary number of arbitrary bytes to the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates this by corrupting the heap, resulting in the program aborting with `malloc(): corrupted top size`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a maliciously crafted GIF image file.
*   By providing a GIF with specific data, an attacker can trigger the overflow in the `DecodeLZW` function.
*   The `gif2apng` tool processes the crafted GIF file which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted GIF file to be processed by the `gif2apng` tool.
*   No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is in the `gif2apng.cpp` file, specifically in the `DecodeLZW` function.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script demonstrates how to create a malicious GIF file to trigger the overflow, writing 10000 "A"s into a buffer of size 512, leading to memory corruption.
*   The fix involves passing the allocated buffer size to the `DecodeLZW` function and adding checks to ensure the writes don't overflow the buffer.
*   The initial size is calculated with `buffer_size = imagesize * 2;`, and `imagesize` is overwritten at some point leading to the bug.

**Additional Notes:**
* The severity of this vulnerability was initially labeled as "important" and later upgraded to "grave."
*  The issue has been fixed in versions 1.9+srconly-2+deb10u1 and 1.9+srconly-3+deb11u1.
* Multiple CVEs (CVE-2021-45909, CVE-2021-45910 and CVE-2021-45911) were addressed in the same fix.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a "**heap-based buffer overflow**" in the `DecodeLZW` function of gif2apng 1.9. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the `DecodeLZW` function writes data to a buffer allocated with `malloc` without properly validating the size of the data written against the allocated buffer's size. The PoC provided corrupts the heap. This aligns directly with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of buffer overflow where the buffer is allocated on the heap. CWE-122 is ALLOWED based on MITRE mapping guidance. The summary indicates the `imagesize` variable used to determine the buffer size is overwritten, leading to an incorrect size calculation. This makes CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) a relevant contributing factor.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-131 can precede CWE-119.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and alignment with CWE definitions)

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When allocating a buffer for the purpose of transforming, converting, or encoding an input, allocate enough memory to handle the largest possible encoding. For example, in a routine that converts "&" characters to "&amp;" for HTML entity encoding, the output buffer needs to be at least 5 times as large as the input buffer.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Understand the programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, "not-a-number" calculations, and how the language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. [REF-7]


Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This is a broad category. Some examples include:


  - simple math errors,

  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,

  - not accounting for size differences when "transforming" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. "expansion").

This level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.

**[Maintenance]** 

This weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.


This issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed
- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist
