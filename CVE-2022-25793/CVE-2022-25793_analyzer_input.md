# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-25793

## Vulnerability Description
A **Stack-based Buffer Overflow** Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the **lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data** prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files. This vulnerability may allow arbitrary code execution on affected installations of Autodesk 3ds Max.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data**
- **weakness:** **Stack-based Buffer Overflow**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **product:** Autodesk 3ds Max
- **version:** 2022, 2021, and 2020

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-25793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This happens when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The application fails to check the size of input data before copying it to a fixed-size buffer on the stack. This allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to control of the program's execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address or other critical data on the stack, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected Autodesk 3ds Max process. This could allow the attacker to take complete control of the system, install malware, or steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted ActionScript Byte Code files: The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specially crafted ActionScript Byte Code files. An attacker can deliver these malicious files to a user, either through social engineering or by embedding them in a project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify ActionScript Byte Code files.
- The attacker must entice a user to open a malicious ActionScript Byte Code file in a vulnerable version of Autodesk 3ds Max.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Autodesk 3ds Max versions 2022, 2021, and 2020.
- The issue was fixed in versions 2022.3.3, 2021.3.10, and 2020.3.6.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tran Van Khang (khangkito) working with Zero Day Initiative.
