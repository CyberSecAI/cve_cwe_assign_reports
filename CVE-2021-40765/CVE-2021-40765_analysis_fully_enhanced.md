# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-788 | Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Discouraged |
## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**memory corruption**" when parsing a M4A file, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the root cause is an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer," which is essentially an out-of-bounds write. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses this scenario where the product writes data past the end of the intended buffer, causing memory corruption. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a broader class, CWE-787 is more specific and accurately reflects the **weakness**. Retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top candidate. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, offering more specific details about the nature of the memory corruption. It can also be related to other memory corruption issues, like CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), but the provided information doesn't point specifically to the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the clear description of an out-of-bounds write in the CVE reference materials and the retriever results.)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer) is also listed in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. It describes the root cause of the vulnerability more directly as "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer." However, the MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-788 is "Discouraged", recommending the use of lower-level CWE entries when available. Since CWE-787 describes the **weakness** as writing past the end of the buffer, it is a more precise description of the **root cause** than simply accessing the memory location. Because CWE-788 is more directly from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, it is included as a secondary CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships found for CWE-788.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence, as CWE-788 is a more direct description of the **root cause** per the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, but per MITRE guidance it is discouraged, and CWE-787 is a better mapping.)



## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
