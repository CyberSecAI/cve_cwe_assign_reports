## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40765:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer" which is also known as an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-788:** Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally on the system.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with the software (e.g., by opening a malicious file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target system, or the ability to make a user on the target system open a malicious file.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker needs the user to perform an action (e.g., opening a malicious file) in order to exploit the vulnerability

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is due to writing to memory out of the allocated buffer, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. An attacker would need local access to the target machine and the user to perform an action.
