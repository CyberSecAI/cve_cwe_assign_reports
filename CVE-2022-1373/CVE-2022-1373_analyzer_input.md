# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1373

## Vulnerability Description
The restore configuration feature of Softing Secure Integration Server V1.22 is vulnerable to a **directory traversal** vulnerability when processing zip files. An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll and execute code. Using the restore configuration feature to upload a zip file containing a path traversal file may cause a file to be created and executed upon touching the disk.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
- **weakness:** **directory traversal**
- **impact:** arbitrary dll loading and code execution
- **vector:** crafted zip file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Softing Secure Integration Server
- **version:** V1.22
- **component:** restore configuration feature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "restore configuration" feature of Softing Secure Integration Server is vulnerable to a directory traversal when processing zip files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23). The application does not properly validate file paths within the uploaded zip file, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll and execute code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can upload a malicious zip file containing a path traversal file through the "restore configuration" feature of the software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges to use the restore configuration feature, but otherwise requires no special position or capabilities.
