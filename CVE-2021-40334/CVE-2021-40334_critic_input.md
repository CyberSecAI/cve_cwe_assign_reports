## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Missing Handler** vulnerability". This directly corresponds to CWE-431, which is defined as "A handler is not available or implemented." The description explains that this **missing handler** in the proprietary management protocol allows an attacker to activate SSH and disrupt NMS and NE communication.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships mentioned for CWE-431.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct mention of "**Missing Handler**" aligning with CWE-431).

# CWE Examples from Database


## Known Examples for CWE-431: Missing Handler
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-25302** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25302](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25302): SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is missing a handler for when a cast fails, allowing for a crash
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-40334**: Missing Handler vulnerability in the proprietary management protocol (port TCP 5558) of Hitachi Energy FOX61x, XCM20 allows an attacker that exploits the vulnerability by activating SSH on port TCP 5558 to cause disruption to the NMS and NE communication. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy FOX61x versions prior to R15A. Hitachi Energy XCM20 versions prior to R15A.
- **CVE-2021-21296**: Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.7.0 a malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only while a live query is currently ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution. The issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0.
- **CVE-2022-25302**: All versions of package asneg/opcuastack are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing handler for failed casting when unvalidated data is forwarded to boost::get function in OpcUaNodeIdBase.h. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible when sending a specifically crafted OPC UA message with a special encoded NodeId.


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-431: Missing Handler
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A handler is not available or implemented.

### Extended Description
When an exception is thrown and not caught, the process has given up an opportunity to decide if a given failure or event is worth a change in execution.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-691
CanPrecede -> CWE-433

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Handle all possible situations (e.g. error condition).

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If an operation can throw an Exception, implement a handler for that specific exception.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-25302:** SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is missing a handler for when a cast fails, allowing for a crash
