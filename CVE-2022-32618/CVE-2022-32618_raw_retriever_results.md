# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-32618

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-32618

## Query
In typec, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect calculation of buffer size. This could lead to local escalation of privilege, for an attacker who has physical access to the device, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID ALPS07262454 Issue ID ALPS07262454.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: incorrect calculation of buffer size
- **weakness**: out of bounds write
