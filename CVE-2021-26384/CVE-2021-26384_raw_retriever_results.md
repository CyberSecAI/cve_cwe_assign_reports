# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-26384

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-26384

## Query
A malformed SMI (System Management Interface) command may allow an attacker to establish a corrupted SMI Trigger Info data structure, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory reads and writes when triggering an SMI resulting in a potential loss of resources.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: malformed SMI command
