# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-26384

## Vulnerability Description
A malformed SMI (System Management Interface) command may allow an attacker to establish a corrupted SMI Trigger Info data structure, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory reads and writes when triggering an SMI resulting in a potential loss of resources.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **malformed SMI command**
- **impact:** out-of-bounds memory reads and writes
- **vector:** SMI Trigger Info data structure
- **attacker:** attacker
