- **weakness:** **buffer overflow and logic bug**
- **impact:** privilege escalation to root
- **product:** Eternal Terminal
- **version:** prior to version 6.2.0
- **component:** PipeSocketHandlerlisten()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24949:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of a logic bug, a race condition, and a buffer overflow within the Eternal Terminal (ET) software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Logic Bug:** A flaw in `PortForwardHandler::createSource()` allows an attacker to provide an arbitrary `SocketEndpoint` to the `PipeSocketHandler::listen()` function. The `name` member of `SocketEndpoint` is used in system calls like `unlink()`, enabling arbitrary file deletion.
*   **Race Condition:** Within `PipeSocketHandler::listen()`, operations on the `name` variable of `SocketEndpoint` such as `unlink()`, `bind()`, `chmod()`, and `chown()` are performed without proper path verification or synchronization. If an attacker can manipulate the file path (e.g., via symlinks) between `bind()` and `chmod()`/`chown()`, they can change the permissions and ownership of arbitrary files.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `PipeSocketHandler::listen()` function uses `strcpy()` to copy the `name` variable from `SocketEndpoint` into the `local.sun_path` member of a socket. This member has a fixed size of 108 bytes. Because the size of the `name` variable is not checked, a buffer overflow can occur, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain root privileges on the server. This is done by exploiting the race condition to modify the permissions of `/etc/passwd`, allowing the creation of a new root user without a password.
*   Arbitrary file deletion is possible due to the logic bug and improper path handling within `PipeSocketHandler::listen()`.
*   The buffer overflow can be leveraged for more complex memory corruption attacks to control code execution, although this approach requires more effort and is less reliable than the race condition.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An authenticated attacker must be able to send crafted packets to an Eternal Terminal server.
*   The attacker needs to establish an ET connection and send a crafted `InitialPayload` packet containing a `PortForwardSourceRequest` and a malicious `SocketEndpoint`.
*   A separate race utility needs to be run locally on the target to help with the race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must have network access to the ET server.
*   The attacker must be authenticated to the ET server to send the crafted initial payload and trigger the vulnerable code.
*   The attacker must have SSH access to the target machine to upload and execute the race utility.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided code includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit written in Python and C that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 6.1.9 of Eternal Terminal.
*   The provided code includes a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including how the race condition and buffer overflow are exploited to gain root access.
*   The fix involved using `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` to prevent the buffer overflow and modifying the path handling logic.
