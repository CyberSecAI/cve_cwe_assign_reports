# Analysis for CVE-2021-26635

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.85 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-681 | Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that a "**stack buffer overflow**" can occur due to the "**wrong use of the data type**" in the ark library. This leads to potential remote code execution. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses the stated weakness of a stack buffer overflow. The root cause, "**wrong use of the data type**," suggests an underlying issue with type conversion or handling, which could contribute to the buffer overflow. CWE-681 (Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types) is a candidate because the description indicates a data type issue.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-681 is related to CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast) and can precede CWE-119 if a type conversion error leads to an incorrect buffer size calculation.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *CWE-121 Confidence:* 0.85 (High confidence due to direct mention of "stack buffer overflow.")
  - *CWE-681 Confidence:* 0.75 (Medium confidence as it represents a plausible root cause but requires more specific information.)
