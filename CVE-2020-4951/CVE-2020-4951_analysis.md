# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that "IBM Cognos Analytics 11.1.7 and 11.2.0 contains locally cached browser data, that could allow a local attacker to **obtain sensitive information**." This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-525 (Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information), which is a Variant level CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-525 as the top candidate with a combined score of 0.4858, and its usage is ALLOWED. The attack vector `AV:L` (Local Attack Vector) from the CVSS vector further supports this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a related Class-level CWE, CWE-525 is more specific as it identifies the browser cache as the mechanism for exposure. CWE-525 does not have explicit parent-child relationships listed in the provided data. The primary weakness is the caching of sensitive information in the browser.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and retriever results)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a Class-level CWE, which could be applicable because the **impact** of the vulnerability is that a local attacker could **obtain sensitive information.** However, CWE-200 is discouraged for use according to MITRE's mapping guidance: "CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available." Since the more specific Variant CWE-525 directly describes the caching issue, CWE-200 is a secondary consideration.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-200 is a high-level Class CWE. It does not have any direct relationships in the provided documentation.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence, as it is a more general weakness, and a more specific CWE is available.)
