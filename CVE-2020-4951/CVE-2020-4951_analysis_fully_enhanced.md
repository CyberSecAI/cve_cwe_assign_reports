# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-4951

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-525 | Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that "IBM Cognos Analytics 11.1.7 and 11.2.0 contains locally cached browser data, that could allow a local attacker to **obtain sensitive information**." This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-525 (Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information), which is a Variant level CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-525 as the top candidate with a combined score of 0.4858, and its usage is ALLOWED. The attack vector `AV:L` (Local Attack Vector) from the CVSS vector further supports this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a related Class-level CWE, CWE-525 is more specific as it identifies the browser cache as the mechanism for exposure. CWE-525 does not have explicit parent-child relationships listed in the provided data. The primary weakness is the caching of sensitive information in the browser.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and retriever results)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a Class-level CWE, which could be applicable because the **impact** of the vulnerability is that a local attacker could **obtain sensitive information.** However, CWE-200 is discouraged for use according to MITRE's mapping guidance: "CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available." Since the more specific Variant CWE-525 directly describes the caching issue, CWE-200 is a secondary consideration.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-200 is a high-level Class CWE. It does not have any direct relationships in the provided documentation.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence, as it is a more general weakness, and a more specific CWE is available.)



## Known Examples for CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-4951**: IBM Cognos Analytics 11.1.7 and 11.2.0 contains locally cached browser data, that could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information.
- **CVE-2021-41251**: @sap-cloud-sdk/core contains the core functionality of the SAP Cloud SDK as well as the SAP Business Technology Platform abstractions. This affects applications on SAP Business Technology Platform that use the SAP Cloud SDK and enabled caching of destinations. In affected versions and in some cases, when user information was missing, destinations were cached without user information, allowing other users to retrieve the same destination with its permissions. By default, destination caching is disabled. The security for caching has been increased. The changes are released in version 1.52.0. Users unable to upgrade are advised to disable destination caching (it is disabled by default).
- **CVE-2021-41271**: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions a maliciously crafted request could cause an error response to be cached by intermediate proxies. This could cause a loss of confidentiality for some content. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.
- **CVE-2022-24742**: Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, any other user can view the data if browser tab remains unclosed after log out. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. The application must strictly redirect to login page even browser back button is pressed. Another possibility is to set more strict cache policies for restricted content.
- **CVE-2022-24747**: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. Affected versions of shopware do no properly set sensitive HTTP headers to be non-cacheable. If there is an HTTP cache between the server and client then headers may be exposed via HTTP caches. This issue has been resolved in version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.
