# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-32142

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple CODESYS Products are prone to a out-of bounds read or write access. A low privileged remote attacker may craft a request with invalid offset, which can cause an **out-of-bounds read or write access**, resulting in denial-of-service condition or local memory overwrite, which can lead to a change of local files. User interaction is not required.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **invalid input handling**
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read or write access**
- **impact:** denial-of-service or local memory overwrite
- **vector:** request with invalid offset
- **attacker:** low privileged remote attacker
- **product:** CODESYS Products

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS Control runtime system improperly handles crafted requests with invalid offsets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset. The software uses pointer offsets that are out of range.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can result in a denial-of-service condition or local memory overwrite.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted request with invalid offsets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the controller (or if no level 1 online password is configured on the controller). The attack can be performed remotely.
