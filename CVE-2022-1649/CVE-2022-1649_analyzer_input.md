# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1649

## Vulnerability Description
**Null pointer dereference** in libr/bin/format/mach0/mach0.c in radareorg/radare2 in GitHub repository radareorg/radare2 prior to 5.7.0. It is likely to be exploitable. For more general description of **heap buffer overflow**, see [CWE](https//cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Null pointer dereference**
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **product:** radareorg/radare2
- **version:** prior to 5.7.0
- **component:** libr/bin/format/mach0/mach0.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the Mach-O parser of radare2. Specifically, the `bin->chained_starts[i]->page_start` pointer is accessed without ensuring that `bin->chained_starts[i]` itself is not null.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code directly accesses the `page_start` member of a structure pointed to by `bin->chained_starts[i]` without checking if `bin->chained_starts[i]` is a valid pointer. If `bin->chained_starts[i]` is null, this will result in a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** A null pointer dereference typically leads to a program crash, resulting in denial of service. This is explicitly mentioned in the commit message "Fix null deref in macho parser ##crash".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Mach-O File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted Mach-O file to radare2, that does not properly populate `chained_starts`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a crafted Mach-O file:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed Mach-O file to the radare2 application for parsing.
- **No specific user position/privilege is needed:** The vulnerability is in parsing the file, so the attacker can trigger this vulnerability as long as the application tries to parse the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message mentions that the vulnerability was "Reported by Han0nly via huntrdev" and includes a "BountyID", indicating this issue was found by a security researcher and reported through a bug bounty program.
- A reproducer called "machonull" is also mentioned, indicating there's a test case file demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure `bin->chained_starts[i]` isn't NULL before accessing the `page_start` member.
