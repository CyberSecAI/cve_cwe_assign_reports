# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41012

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no schedule link1 WORD link2 WORD policy (failover|backup) description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes CVE-2022-41012.

**CVE-2022-41012 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020.
*   **Root Cause:** The `sprintf` function is used to format command parameters into a stack buffer, without proper size checks on the input parameters. Specifically, the command parameters size is not checked against the size of the `stack_buffer` before calling sprintf. This allows for a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```c
    sprintf(buff_0x100,"%d<%s<%s<%d<%s",1,*argv,argv[1],dependent_on_argv[2],argv[3]);
    ```
    This code snippet corresponds to the "no schedule link1" command.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted network packet to trigger the vulnerable `DetranCLI` command.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have sufficient privileges to execute commands. According to the CVSS score, this requires a high level of privileges (PR:H).
*  **Exploitation Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the device.
*   **Affected Product:** Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020
*   **Specific Command Template (for CVE-2022-41012):**
    ```
     no schedule link1 WORD link2 WORD policy (failover|backup) description (WORD|null)
    ```
