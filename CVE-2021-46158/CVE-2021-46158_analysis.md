# Analysis for CVE-2021-46158

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **stack based buffer overflow** vulnerability while parsing NEU files. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant-level CWE, making it more specific than the more general CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the stack-based nature of the overflow and the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a relevant CWE because a stack-based buffer overflow leads to writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The vulnerability described directly involves a stack-based buffer, making CWE-121 a more precise classification than its parent CWE. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is related as a consequence of the buffer overflow. It's a peer weakness that highlights the nature of the write operation causing the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference materials, and explicit mention of stack-based buffer overflow)
