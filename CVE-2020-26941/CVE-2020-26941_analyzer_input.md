# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-26941

## Vulnerability Description
A local (authenticated) low-privileged user can exploit a behavior in an ESET installer to achieve arbitrary file overwrite (deletion) of any file via a symlink, due to **insecure permissions**. The possibility of exploiting this vulnerability is limited and can only take place during the installation phase of ESET products. Furthermore, exploitation can only succeed when Self-Defense is disabled. Affected products are ESET NOD32 Antivirus, ESET Internet Security, ESET Smart Security, ESET Smart Security Premium versions 13.2 and lower ESET Endpoint Antivirus, ESET Endpoint Security, ESET NOD32 Antivirus Business Edition, ESET Smart Security Business Edition versions 7.3 and lower ESET File Security for Microsoft Windows Server, ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server, ESET Mail Security for IBM Domino, ESET Security for Kerio, ESET Security for Microsoft SharePoint Server versions 7.2 and lower.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insecure permissions**
- **impact:** arbitrary file overwrite (deletion)
- **vector:** symlink
- **attacker:** local (authenticated) low-privileged user
- **product:** ESET products
- **component:** ESET installer

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that during the installation or upgrade process of ESET products, the self-defense mechanism is not fully active. This creates a window of opportunity where a user with limited rights can manipulate files within the ESET directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient protection during installation/upgrade: ESET's self-defense mechanism is not fully active during these processes.
- Insecure file writing permissions: The vulnerability allows users to write or rewrite files within the ESET directory that they would normally not have permissions to access.
- Lack of active self-defense mechanism when it is turned off.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A user with limited rights can exploit this vulnerability to gain higher privileges by forcing the ESET product to write into files that are normally not writable. This allows the attacker to potentially compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File manipulation during installation or upgrade.
- File manipulation while self-defense is turned off.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the target Windows system.
- Ability to make changes in an ESET directory.
- Timing to exploit the vulnerable period during installation/upgrade, or by turning off the self-defense.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in specific versions of ESET products for Windows (listed in the document).
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Medium" severity.
- The window of opportunity during installation/upgrade is described as "narrow" and difficult to control.
- Micro Program Component Update (uPCU) is not affected, while standard PCU is affected.
- The self-defense mechanism protects already installed products when enabled.
- ESET has released fixed installation packages to address this issue.
