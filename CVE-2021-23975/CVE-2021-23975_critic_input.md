# Critic Input for CVE-2021-23975



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
The developer page aboutmemory has a Measure function for exploring what object types the browser has allocated and their sizes. When this function was invoked we incorrectly called the sizeof function, instead of using the API method that checks for invalid pointers. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect function call**
- **vector:** invalid pointers
- **product:** Firefox
- **version:** < 86
- **component:** developer page aboutmemory

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of memory profiling code within the `about:memory` developer tool in Firefox. Specifically, the code directly called the `sizeof` function on a pointer without first validating if the pointer was valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect pointer handling: The code attempted to use `malloc_usable_size()` on a pointer that was not allocated through malloc, leading to an invalid memory access.
- Lack of proper validation: The `sizeof` function was called directly without checking the pointer's validity, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash in Firefox when the `about:memory` "Measure" function is invoked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User interaction: The vulnerability is triggered by a user navigating to `about:memory` and clicking the "Measure" button.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access and interact with Firefox's user interface. No special privileges or remote access are needed, as it can be triggered by a user within their own browser session.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved using the correct API that checks for invalid pointers before calling `sizeof`, thus preventing the crash.
- The vulnerability was classified as low severity and was fixed in Firefox 86 and later versions, and was not present in the ESR 78.x branch.
- The vulnerability was also fixed in Firefox Beta 86.
- This issue is not exploitable to execute code, but just leads to a crash of the browser.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary clearly indicate that the **root cause** is an **incorrect function call**, specifically using `sizeof()` on a pointer without validating its validity first. This directly corresponds to CWE-467, which describes the "Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type". The description notes that this can be an incorrect calculation if the programmer intended to determine the size of the data that is being pointed to, aligning with the vulnerability.
The CVE Reference links section supports this by stating that "the code directly called the `sizeof` function on a pointer without first validating if the pointer was valid." The impact was a crash due to an invalid memory access. This makes CWE-467 the most appropriate primary mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-467 is a Variant-level CWE. While it's related to memory safety issues, it doesn't have direct parent-child relationships in the provided data. The relationship to memory access is evident.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Strong alignment between vulnerability description, CVE summary, and CWE-467 description)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the primary issue is the incorrect use of `sizeof()`, the resulting crash suggests a potential dereference of an invalid pointer, which can be a NULL pointer. The CVE summary mentions "invalid memory access" as a result. While the evidence doesn't explicitly state a NULL pointer dereference, it's a plausible consequence of using `sizeof()` on an invalid pointer. Therefore, CWE-476 is considered a secondary candidate. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-476 is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) is a Base-level CWE. It could be related to a broader Class CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions). However, the evidence does not support a more general classification.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Inferred possibility of NULL pointer dereference, but not explicitly stated)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-38599**: WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of the official binary releases published as GitHub Releases) is used, silently ignores the libsodium encryption key and uploads cleartext backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation because "the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity."
- **CVE-2021-39196**: pcapture is an open source dumpcap web service interface . In affected versions this vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged user to use the REST API to capture and download packets with no capture filter and without adequate permissions. This is important because the capture filters can effectively limit the scope of information that a user can see in the data captures. If no filter is present, then all data on the local network segment where the program is running can be captured and downloaded. v3.12 fixes this problem. There is no workaround, you must upgrade to v3.12 or greater.
- **CVE-2020-15117**: In Synergy before version 1.12.0, a Synergy server can be crashed by receiving a kMsgHelloBack packet with a client name length set to 0xffffffff (4294967295) if the servers memory is less than 4 GB. It was verified that this issue does not cause a crash through the exception handler if the available memory of the Server is more than 4GB.
- **CVE-2020-15223**: In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors coming from the storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for her advantage depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed in version 0.34.0
- **CVE-2020-15566**: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a host OS crash because of incorrect error handling in event-channel port allocation. The allocation of an event-channel port may fail for multiple reasons: (1) port is already in use, (2) the memory allocation failed, or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than what is supported by the ABI (e.g., 2L or FIFO) used by the guest or the limit set by an administrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due to the missing error checks, only (1) will be considered an error. All the other cases will provide a valid port and will result in a crash when trying to access the event channel. When the administrator configured a guest to allow more than 1023 event channels, that guest may be able to crash the host. When Xen is out-of-memory, allocation of new event channels will result in crashing the host rather than reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are affected. All architectures are affected. The default configuration, when guests are created with xl/libxl, is not vulnerable, because of the default event-channel limit.
- **CVE-2021-31361**: An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability combined with Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated network based attacker to cause increased FPC CPU utilization by sending specific IP packets which are being VXLAN encapsulated leading to a partial Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipted of these specific traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX Series: All versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S4; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S12; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S7; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S4; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S1; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S3, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

### Extended Description


The programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions, thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability, incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability.


Note that this entry is not exclusively about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.


### Alternative Terms
None

CanPrecede -> CWE-416
ParentOf -> CWE-252
ParentOf -> CWE-253
ParentOf -> CWE-273
ParentOf -> CWE-354
ParentOf -> CWE-394
ParentOf -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Choose languages with features such as exception handling that force the programmer to anticipate unusual conditions that may generate exceptions. Custom exceptions may need to be developed to handle unusual business-logic conditions. Be careful not to pass sensitive exceptions back to the user (CWE-209, CWE-248).


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is expected.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** If using exception handling, catch and throw specific exceptions instead of overly-general exceptions (CWE-396, CWE-397). Catch and handle exceptions as locally as possible so that exceptions do not propagate too far up the call stack (CWE-705). Avoid unchecked or uncaught exceptions where feasible (CWE-248).



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2007-3798:** Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.
- **CVE-2006-4447:** Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.



## CWE-467: Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code calls sizeof() on a pointer type, which can be an incorrect calculation if the programmer intended to determine the size of the data that is being pointed to.

### Extended Description
The use of sizeof() on a pointer can sometimes generate useful information. An obvious case is to find out the wordsize on a platform. More often than not, the appearance of sizeof(pointer) indicates a bug.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-131

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Use expressions such as "sizeof(*pointer)" instead of "sizeof(pointer)", unless you intend to run sizeof() on a pointer type to gain some platform independence or if you are allocating a variable on the stack.






## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
NPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference
null deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference
NPE: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Exception
nil pointer dereference: used for access of nil in Go programs

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-710
ChildOf -> CWE-754
ChildOf -> CWE-754
CanFollow -> CWE-1325
CanFollow -> CWE-252
CanFollow -> CWE-362
CanFollow -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If all pointers that could have been modified are checked for NULL before use, nearly all NULL pointer dereferences can be prevented.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Select a programming language that is not susceptible to these issues.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is non-null before acting upon it.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.
- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference
- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference
