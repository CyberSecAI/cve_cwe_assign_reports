- **product:** Open Asset Import Library (aka assimp)
- **version:** 5.1.0 and 5.1.1
- **component:** _m3d_safestr

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `_m3d_safestr` function of the assimp library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A write operation attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The heap overflow can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior, leading to a denial of service.
- The vulnerability is classified as HIGH severity in the oss-fuzz report

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted 3D model file (M3D format specifically).
- The vulnerable code is in the `m3d_load` function within the `Assimp::M3DWrapper::M3DWrapper` constructor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious 3D model file to the application using the vulnerable `assimp` library.
- The application must process the file using the vulnerable function.
- The exploit can be triggered remotely according to the gentoo advisory

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz (Google's fuzzing service)
- The vulnerability is tracked in the OSS-Fuzz issue tracker with id 34416
- The vulnerable code exists between commit `af0aca796ebab7663bba2778f7f30dd424f324ca` and was fixed by commit `30f17aa2064b86c0096f0ec701b9e8ea9312fef2` in the assimp github repository
- Gentoo security advisory GLSA 202210-01 addressed this issue by bumping the package version to 5.2.2.
