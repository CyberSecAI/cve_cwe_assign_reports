# Final Resolution for CVE-2021-1119

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-415 | Double Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **double-free** condition. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | This is a secondary CWE because the **double-free** *may* lead to a write-what-where condition, which is a type of out-of-bounds write. The **double-free** corrupts memory management structures, potentially allowing arbitrary memory overwrites. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the potential for CWE-415 (**Double Free**) to lead to CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**). CWE-415 corrupts memory management structures, and this corruption can enable an attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory locations, achieving a "write-what-where" condition. The abstraction levels were also considered, ensuring that the chosen CWEs were at the optimal level of specificity (Variant for CWE-415 and Base for CWE-787).mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **double-free** condition (CWE-415). This **double-free** corrupts the memory management structures. A corrupted memory management structure can then be leveraged to overwrite memory locations outside the intended bounds (CWE-787), leading to a "write-what-where" condition. This, in turn, allows for arbitrary code execution, impacting integrity and availability.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified CWE-415 (**Double Free**) as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **double-free**. The addition of CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) is also justified, as the **double-free** can lead to a "write-what-where" condition.

The relationship analysis supports the inclusion of both CWEs. The vulnerability description states the "it can **double-free** a pointer, which *may* lead to denial of service. This flaw *may* result in a write-what-where condition, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code impacting integrity and availability." The word "may" indicates that the **double-free** does not always lead to a write-what-where, so a slightly lower confidence is assigned.

The selection of CWE-415 as a Variant and CWE-787 as a Base is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-415 accurately captures the specific **double-free** condition, while CWE-787 describes the resulting **out-of-bounds write**.
