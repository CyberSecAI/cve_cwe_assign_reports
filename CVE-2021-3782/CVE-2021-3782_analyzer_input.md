# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3782

## Vulnerability Description
An internal reference count is held on the buffer pool, incremented every time a new buffer is created from the pool. The reference count is maintained as an int on LP64 systems this can cause the reference count to overflow if the client creates a large number of wl_shm buffer objects, or if it can coerce the server to create a large number of external references to the buffer storage. With the **reference count overflow**ing, a use-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool tracking structure, where values may be incremented or decremented it may also be possible to construct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to the attacking client at a time.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reference count overflow**
- **impact:** use-after-free
- **attacker:** client
- **component:** wl_shm_pool

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the reference count of shared memory objects. The code uses a signed `int` for the reference count which can be overflowed by a malicious client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the Wayland compositor.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious client creates a large number of references to shared memory objects causing the integer reference counter to overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be a client interacting with the Wayland compositor.
