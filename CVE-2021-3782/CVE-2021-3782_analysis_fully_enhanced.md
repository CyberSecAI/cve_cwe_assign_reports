## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **"reference count overflow"** which is a direct indicator of CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating: "Integer overflow in the reference count of shared memory objects. The code uses a signed `int` for the reference count which can be overflowed by a malicious client." This overflow leads to a use-after-free condition on the `wl_shm_pool` tracking structure.  The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-190 as the top match with a high combined score. CWE-190 is a Base level CWE which is a preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-190 indicates this is ALLOWED. The subsequent use-after-free condition can be mapped to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The "Vulnerability Description" describes how the reference count overflowing leads to a use-after-free on the `wl_shm_pool` tracking structure. CWE-911 (Improper Update of Reference Count) is also considered since the root cause is a reference counter mismanagement but the overflow is a more accurate root cause.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a base level weakness.  CWE-190 can lead to CWE-416 (Use After Free) because the integer overflow causes incorrect memory management. CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is related because a large memory allocation could contribute to the overflow. CWE-911(Improper Update of Reference Count) is related since the reference count is not properly managed leading to the overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear technical description and supporting CVE reference details pointing to integer overflow)



## Known Examples for CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3701](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3701): program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1708): memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field
- **CVE-2008-0977** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0977](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0977): large value in a length field leads to memory consumption and crash when no more memory is available
- **CVE-2006-3791** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3791](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3791): large key size in game program triggers crash when a resizing function cannot allocate enough memory
- **CVE-2004-2589** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2589](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2589): large Content-Length HTTP header value triggers application crash in instant messaging application due to failure in memory allocation
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18899**: An uncontrolled memory allocation in DataBufdata(subBox.length-sizeof(box)) function of Exiv2 0.27 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a crafted input.
- **CVE-2021-3527**: A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.
- **CVE-2021-36174**: A memory allocation with excessive size value vulnerability in the license verification function of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow an attacker to perform a denial of service attack via specially crafted license blobs.
- **CVE-2020-5802**: An attacker-controlled memory allocation size can be passed to the C++ new operator in RnaDaSvr.dll by sending a specially crafted ConfigureItems message to TCP port 4241. This will cause an unhandled exception, resulting in termination of RSLinxNG.exe. Observed in FactoryTalk 6.11. All versions of FactoryTalk Linx are affected.
