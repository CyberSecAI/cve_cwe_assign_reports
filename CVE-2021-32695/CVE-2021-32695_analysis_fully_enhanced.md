# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-32695

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information When Handling Initially | 0.85 | Class | Primary | The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information due to insufficient access control on shared preferences. |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | Sensitive data such as push tokens and account names are being exposed. |
| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 0.60 | Base | Secondary | A malicious app is gaining unauthorized access to data it should not have. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability in the Nextcloud Android app allows a malicious app to access shared preferences, leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as push tokens and account names. This aligns with CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information When Handling Initially) because the app is not properly protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. The shared preferences are intended to be private, but **insufficient access control** allows other applications to read them. This can be seen as a **privilege management** issue (CWE-269) because the malicious app is gaining unauthorized access to data it should not have. Furthermore, the sensitive information is being exposed, implicating CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) as the sensitive data is being made accessible to another application. CWE-200 serves as the primary classification since it broadly captures the exposure of sensitive information, while CWE-201 and CWE-269 provide more specific insights into the nature of the weakness. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" clearly indicates the **exposure of sensitive data** and **insufficient access control** as key weaknesses.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, with various children that describe specific types of information exposure. CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200. CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) can result from missing authorization checks, which is relevant here. The relationships show that information exposure often precedes or is related to privilege management issues.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

## Known Examples for CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708): Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24226**: In the AccessAlly WordPress plugin before 3.5.7, the file "resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php" responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode is dumping serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.
- **CVE-2021-33687**: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.
- **CVE-2021-3509**: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **CVE-2021-34771**: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.
- **CVE-2021-25122**: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.
- **CVE-2021-0644**: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462
- **CVE-2020-11922**: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
- **CVE-2021-24170**: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.
- **CVE-2021-24585**: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id
