## Query
An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In an EVPN-MPLS scenario, if MAC is learned locally on an access interface but later a request to delete is received indicating that the MAC was learnt remotely, this can lead to memory corruption which can result in line card crash and reload. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions 17.3R1 and later versions prior to 19.2R3-S5 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S8 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S3 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S3-EVO 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R1-S1-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 17.3R1.
