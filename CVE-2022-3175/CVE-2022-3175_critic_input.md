- **impact:** open redirect
- **vector:** Custom Error Page
- **product:** ikus060/rdiffweb
- **version:** prior to 2.4.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3175.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default error page potentially leaking stack trace information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The default error page in the application may expose sensitive information by including the stack trace when an error occurs. This information could aid an attacker in understanding the application's internal workings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could gain insight into the application's internal structure, potentially revealing information about the software, system paths, and code logic which might be leveraged for further attacks or exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could trigger application errors that lead to a stack trace being displayed in the error page, by sending malformed requests or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that force the application to throw an error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not require authentication and can trigger errors simply by accessing the web application.

# Analysis to Review
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.8 | Base | Primary | The application's default error page leaks stack trace information, revealing sensitive details. |
| CWE-756 | Missing Custom Error Page | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | The absence of a custom error page causes the default error page to be displayed, which exposes the stack trace. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the default error page in the application leaks stack trace information. This aligns directly with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), as the stack trace contains sensitive details about the application's internal workings, system paths, and code logic. The **rootcause** is an **improper redirect** to the default error page. CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page) is a contributing factor, as the application uses the default error page due to the absence of a custom one. The impact of the vulnerability is information disclosure, which could aid an attacker in further attacks. The retriever results also show a high score for CWE-209. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-209 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) is a base level CWE. It is related to CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page) because the missing custom error page leads to the display of the default error page, which contains sensitive information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

### Extended Description


The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:


  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it

  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer

An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of ".." sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.


If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.


Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Handle exceptions internally and do not display errors containing potentially sensitive information to a user.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Use naming conventions and strong types to make it easier to spot when sensitive data is being used. When creating structures, objects, or other complex entities, separate the sensitive and non-sensitive data as much as possible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-2049:** POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent. Might be resultant from another weakness.
- **CVE-2007-5172:** Program reveals password in error message if attacker can trigger certain database errors.
- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).



## CWE-756: Missing Custom Error Page
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not return custom error pages to the user, possibly exposing sensitive information.
