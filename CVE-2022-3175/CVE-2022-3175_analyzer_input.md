## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-3175.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default error page potentially leaking stack trace information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The default error page in the application may expose sensitive information by including the stack trace when an error occurs. This information could aid an attacker in understanding the application's internal workings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could gain insight into the application's internal structure, potentially revealing information about the software, system paths, and code logic which might be leveraged for further attacks or exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could trigger application errors that lead to a stack trace being displayed in the error page, by sending malformed requests or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that force the application to throw an error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not require authentication and can trigger errors simply by accessing the web application.
