# Critic Input for CVE-2022-2023



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs in GitHub repository polonel/trudesk prior to 1.2.4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect use of privileged APIs**
- **product:** polonel/trudesk
- **version:** prior to 1.2.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect API endpoint being used in the profile update functionality. The original code was attempting to use `/api/v1/users/:username` for profile updates. This commit changes the endpoint to `/api/v1/profile/` which will correctly utilize the `apiUsers.profileUpdate` function as defined in `src/controllers/api/v1/users.js`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect API Endpoint:** The primary vulnerability was the incorrect API endpoint used in the frontend JavaScript file (`src/public/js/angularjs/controllers/profile.js`). It was attempting to perform a PUT request to `/api/v1/users/:username` which is likely meant for user updates, not profile updates. 
- **Potential for Unauthorized Access:** Using the wrong endpoint for a profile update could lead to unintended consequences as the backend was not configured to handle profile updates via that route. This could potentially expose user data or allow an attacker to potentially manipulate user data if they were to figure out the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

While the provided information doesn't explicitly state the impact of exploiting the incorrect endpoint, potential impacts could be:

- **Profile Update Failure:**  The user would not be able to update their profile information because the API call would be routed incorrectly.
- **Data Inconsistency:**  If the incorrect endpoint was still functional with limited data it could lead to data inconsistencies by modifying the wrong data.
- **Potential for Unauthorized User Modification:** If the incorrect endpoint was not correctly secured it could be possible for an attacker to modify another users profile.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct API Manipulation:** An attacker could directly send a PUT request to the incorrect endpoint `/api/v1/users/:username` with malicious data, this would only work if the backend was not configured correctly.
- **Frontend Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the JavaScript code of the front-end to call the incorrect endpoint with malicious data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** An attacker would need to understand how the API is structured, or be able to inspect the front end to understand which API endpoint is being called.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP requests to the server.
- **Access to the application:** The attacker would need access to the application or its front end.

**Additional Details:**

- The commit also includes changes in `src/controllers/api/v1/users.js` to properly handle the `/api/v1/profile/` update request.
-  The fix includes checks to ensure the user exists and if the password is being updated the password complexity is checked.
- The commit also includes a change to correctly pass the data to the new API endpoint `/api/v1/profile/`.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights an **incorrect use of privileged APIs** in the trudesk application. Specifically, the frontend JavaScript was attempting to use the `/api/v1/users/:username` endpoint for profile updates, which is incorrect. The correct endpoint should have been `/api/v1/profile/`. This **incorrect use of a privileged API** directly aligns with CWE-648 (Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the original code was attempting to use an incorrect API endpoint and the fix involves changing the endpoint to the correct one. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-648 indicates that this is ALLOWED as it is at the Base level of abstraction."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "While CWE-648 doesn't have direct relationships defined in the provided data, it's important to consider that **incorrect use of privileged APIs** can stem from underlying authorization issues. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) could be a related weakness. If the authorization checks were not properly implemented or configured for the original endpoint, it could have contributed to the vulnerability. Also, if there was no authentication for the `/api/v1/users/:username` endpoint, it would be **missing authentication for a critical function**, and CWE-306 would be applicable. However, the primary **rootcause** is the **incorrect API usage**, making CWE-648 the primary CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-648: Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not conform to the API requirements for a function call that requires extra privileges. This could allow attackers to gain privileges by causing the function to be called incorrectly.

### Extended Description


When a product contains certain functions that perform operations requiring an elevated level of privilege, the caller of a privileged API must be careful to:


  - ensure that assumptions made by the APIs are valid, such as validity of arguments

  - account for known weaknesses in the design/implementation of the API

  - call the API from a safe context

If the caller of the API does not follow these requirements, then it may allow a malicious user or process to elevate their privilege, hijack the process, or steal sensitive data.

For instance, it is important to know if privileged APIs do not shed their privileges before returning to the caller or if the privileged function might make certain assumptions about the data, context or state information passed to it by the caller. It is important to always know when and how privileged APIs can be called in order to ensure that their elevated level of privilege cannot be exploited.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-269

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Before calling privileged APIs, always ensure that the assumptions made by the privileged code hold true prior to making the call.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Know architecture and implementation weaknesses of the privileged APIs and make sure to account for these weaknesses before calling the privileged APIs to ensure that they can be called safely.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If privileged APIs make certain assumptions about data, context or state validity that are passed by the caller, the calling code must ensure that these assumptions have been validated prior to making the call.




### Observed Examples

## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the product into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. Use role-based access control (RBAC) [REF-229] to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.


Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that access control checks are performed related to the business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that are applied to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor [REF-7].

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].




### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
