## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description outlines a **Token Recipient Confusion** issue in Wire's SAML implementation. An attacker with knowledge of SAML IdP metadata can manipulate the SAML SSO configuration of a targeted team, leading to unauthorized access, deletion of SAML authenticated accounts, and creation of arbitrary accounts. This aligns strongly with CWE-1270 (Generation of Incorrect Security Tokens), as the root cause lies in the incorrect generation or handling of security tokens within the SAML authentication process. The **attacker** is able to **authenticate** as a user, which is the impact of **token recipient confusion**.
  The retriever results also strongly support CWE-1270, with the highest combined score, and the description matches the vulnerability well. MITRE's mapping guidance designates the usage as "Allowed" for the Base abstraction level.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-1270 does not have direct relationships to other CWEs in the provided data, the authentication bypass aspect of the vulnerability suggests a possible relationship with authentication-related CWEs.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence based on the vulnerability description and retriever results. The direct mention of security tokens and the impact on SAML authentication strongly support this mapping.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability allows an attacker to **authenticate as a user** of the targeted team and create arbitrary accounts. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also mentions unauthorized access. This suggests that an authentication bypass is occurring, specifically by spoofing or impersonating a legitimate user. CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) captures this aspect of the vulnerability, where the attacker can effectively bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-290 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). However, CWE-290 is more specific, as it focuses on spoofing attacks.
  Although the similarity score is lower, this is still relevant because the attacker ultimately gains unauthorized access, which aligns with the Authentication Bypass by Spoofing.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Moderate confidence, as this is a secondary aspect of the vulnerability. The primary weakness is the token confusion, but the authentication bypass is a direct consequence.)



## Known Examples for CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30319](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30319): S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2009-1048** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1048](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1048): VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-29280**: In TP-Link Wireless N Router WR840N an ARP poisoning attack can cause buffer overflow
- **CVE-2021-0232**: An authentication bypass vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center may allow an attacker with specific information about the deployment to mimic an already registered Test Agent and access its configuration including associated inventory details. If the issue occurs, the affected Test Agent will not be able to connect to the Control Center. This issue affects Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center All versions prior to 2.35.6; 2.36 versions prior to 2.36.2.
- **CVE-2021-22779**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing vulnerability exists in EcoStruxure Control Expert (all versions prior to V15.0 SP1, including all versions of Unity Pro), EcoStruxure Control Expert V15.0 SP1, EcoStruxure Process Expert (all versions, including all versions of EcoStruxure Hybrid DCS), SCADAPack RemoteConnect for x70 (all versions), Modicon M580 CPU (all versions - part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*), Modicon M340 CPU (all versions - part numbers BMXP34*), that could cause unauthorized access in read and write mode to the controller by spoofing the Modbus communication between the engineering software and the controller.
- **CVE-2020-19003**: An issue in Gate One 1.2.0 allows attackers to bypass to the verification check done by the origins list and connect to Gate One instances used by hosts not on the origins list.
- **CVE-2020-22001**: HomeAutomation 3.3.2 suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability when spoofing client IP address using the X-Forwarded-For header with the local (loopback) IP address value allowing remote control of the smart home solution.
- **CVE-2021-22002**: VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager, allow the /cfg web app and diagnostic endpoints, on port 8443, to be accessed via port 443 using a custom host header. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 could tamper with host headers to facilitate access to the /cfg web app, in addition a malicious actor could access /cfg diagnostic endpoints without authentication.
- **CVE-2021-23008**: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.4, 12.1.x before 12.1.6, and all versions of 16.0.x and 11.6.x., BIG-IP APM AD (Active Directory) authentication can be bypassed via a spoofed AS-REP (Kerberos Authentication Service Response) response sent over a hijacked KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) connection or from an AD server compromised by an attacker. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.
- **CVE-2021-41753**: A denial-of-service attack in WPA2, and WPA3-SAE authentication methods in D-Link DIR-X1560, v1.04B04, and DIR-X6060, v1.11B04 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to disconnect a wireless client via sending specific spoofed SAE authentication frames.
