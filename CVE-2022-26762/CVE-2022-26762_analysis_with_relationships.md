# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-26762 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves **memory corruption** which can lead to writing data outside the intended buffer. |
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.5 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability involves **memory corruption** which may cause the program to access a memory location that has been freed. |
| CWE-843 | Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability involves **memory corruption** which may cause the program to interpret data using an incorrect type. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates a **memory corruption** issue that allows a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is **memory corruption** due to improper memory handling in the Wi-Fi component.
  - The primary weakness is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), since memory corruption can lead to writing data past the end of intended buffer.
  - The secondary weakness could be CWE-416 (Use After Free), CWE-843 (Type Confusion).

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE. CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration) and a peer of CWE-416 (Use After Free). CWE-843 is a child of CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Medium evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
