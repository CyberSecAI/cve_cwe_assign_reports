# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-21729

## Vulnerability Description
Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `UnravelIndex` is vulnerable to a division by zero caused by an **integer overflow** bug. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** division by zero
- **product:** Tensorflow
- **version:** 2.8.0
- **component:** UnravelIndex

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `UnravelIndex` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code calculates the product of the input dimensions without properly checking for potential overflow. This overflow can lead to a zero value, causing a subsequent division by zero error in the unraveling process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper handling for potential integer overflows when calculating the product of dimensions.
*   **Division by Zero:** The integer overflow can result in a zero value used as a divisor, leading to a division-by-zero error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A division-by-zero error will cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker provides a carefully crafted input to the `UnravelIndex` operation with dimensions that cause an integer overflow when their product is calculated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to pass inputs to the `UnravelIndex` operation. This could be through direct use of the TensorFlow API or by manipulating data processed by a model that utilizes the `UnravelIndex` operation.

**More Details:**

*   The provided patch commit [58b34c6c8250983948b5a781b426f6aa01fd47af](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/58b34c6c8250983948b5a781b426f6aa01fd47af) introduces checks for integer overflow before calculating the product of dimensions. The commit also includes a test case to explicitly demonstrate and prevent the integer overflow.
*   The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.8.0, but was backported to 2.5.3, 2.6.3, and 2.7.1.
* The vulnerable code can be found in the `unravel_index_op.cc` file.
*   The fix includes a check that ensures the product of dimensions does not exceed the maximum value for the used integer type (`kint64max` or `kint32max`).
