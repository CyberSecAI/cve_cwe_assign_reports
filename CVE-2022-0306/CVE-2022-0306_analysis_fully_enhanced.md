# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" exists in PDFium in Google Chrome. The **rootcause** is a "**buffer overflow**" that leads to heap corruption. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the "**Root cause of vulnerability**" as "Heap buffer overflow in PDFium" and the "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**" as "Heap buffer overflow". The Retriever Results also list CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as highly relevant. Given that the vulnerability is specifically a heap-based overflow, CWE-122 is the most accurate and specific mapping. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also relevant as a more general case of writing outside buffer boundaries, the specific context of a heap overflow makes CWE-122 the primary and more descriptive choice.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a more general class of buffer overflows. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a parent of CWE-122. The relationship between CWE-122 and CWE-787 suggests that while CWE-787 captures the out-of-bounds write aspect, CWE-122 provides the specific context of the heap, making it a more precise classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, supported by Retriever Results)

## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
