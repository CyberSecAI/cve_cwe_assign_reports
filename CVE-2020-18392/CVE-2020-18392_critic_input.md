## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a stack overflow triggered by deeply nested array structures during JSON parsing in the `mjs` library. The vulnerability occurs because the `parse_array` function recursively calls `parse_value`, which in turn calls `parse_array` again when encountering another array, which leads to excessive stack usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack overflow: Recursive calls to `parse_array` and `parse_value` without a proper limit on nesting depth leads to excessive stack usage. The specific vulnerability lies in the recursive parsing logic, where there is no check or limit on the depth of nesting allowed in JSON arrays.
- `memcpy` is called by `mjs_mk_string` on the stack when processing strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The stack overflow causes the program to crash, leading to a denial of service. This renders the `mjs` interpreter unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted JSON input: A malicious attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JSON input with deeply nested arrays.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide JSON input to the `mjs` library/interpreter. This could be done through an API that accepts JSON input, a configuration file, or any other point where the interpreter processes JSON.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing deeply nested arrays.
- The AddressSanitizer output shows that the stack overflow happens in `__asan_memcpy`, which is called by `mjs_mk_string`. The overflow is a result of many calls to `parse_array` and `parse_value` due to the nested arrays.
- The code references `mjs.c:14225` where the stack overflow occurs within the `mjs_mk_string` function.
- The `mjs_mk_string` is called by `mjs_get_own_property` which is called by `mjs_set_internal` ... and eventually `parse_array`

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) files `so_mjs.c:14225_1.js` and `so_mjs.c:14225_2.js` (located at ntu-sec/pocs) are examples of crafted JSON payloads which can trigger the vulnerability.
- The ASAN output includes the call stack, further clarifying the sequence of function calls that lead to the stack overflow.
- The issue was reported in 2018 but the CVE was assigned in 2020.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **stack overflow** in the `parse_array` function of Cesanta MJS. The CVE reference summary details how deeply nested array structures lead to recursive calls of `parse_array` and `parse_value`, which exhausts the stack. This aligns directly with CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion Depth). CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and while it might be more precise to identify the exact cause of the stack exhaustion, the core issue is the lack of control over recursion depth. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-674 is Allowed-with-Review since it's a Class.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While the direct relationships of CWE-674 are limited, the vulnerability's nature suggests a potential chain where uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674) leads to resource exhaustion, specifically a stack overflow. There are no direct relationships to explore.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The ASAN output shows that the stack overflow happens in `__asan_memcpy`, which is called by `mjs_mk_string`. This reveals a secondary weakness, a stack-based buffer overflow, since `memcpy` is writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack. This aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The Retriever Results lists CWE-121 as a candidate, and its mapping guidance is Allowed.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While the primary weakness is the uncontrolled recursion, the buffer overflow contributes to the denial of service.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Sufficient evidence to support the presence of CWE-121 as a secondary contributing factor)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834
ParentOf -> CWE-776

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Ensure an end condition will be reached under all logic conditions. The end condition may include testing against the depth of recursion and exiting with an error if the recursion goes too deep. The complexity of the end condition contributes to the effectiveness of this action.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Description:** Increase the stack size.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.
