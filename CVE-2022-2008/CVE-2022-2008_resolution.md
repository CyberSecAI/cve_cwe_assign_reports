# Final Resolution for CVE-2022-2008

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-415 | Double Free | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.3 | Class | Contributing | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-415 (**Double Free**), a variant of CWE-666 (**Operation on Resource in Wrong Phase of Lifetime**). CWE-415 can be caused by CWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**), which could lead to the double free if multiple threads are involved in freeing the same memory. CWE-415 is a peer of CWE-416 (**Use After Free**), which is a similar memory corruption issue. The abstraction level of CWE-415 is Variant, making it specific enough for the given vulnerability description. The potential for a race condition (CWE-362) is considered but not confirmed, hence a lower confidence score.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a potential concurrency issue (CWE-362), which could lead to a double free (CWE-415). The double free then results in heap corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit the corrupted heap. The explicit mention of "double free" in the vulnerability description makes CWE-415 the primary weakness. If concurrency is involved, CWE-362 can be added to the chain.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified CWE-415 (**Double Free**) as the primary **WEAKNESS**. The criticism highlighted the potential for contributing factors such as race conditions (CWE-362) and the possibility of a use-after-free condition (CWE-416). The vulnerability description states, "Double free in WebGL in Google Chrome prior to 102.0.5005.115 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page."

The graph relationships influenced the decision by showing the potential for CWE-362 to precede CWE-415. However, without explicit evidence of a race condition in the vulnerability description, the confidence in including CWE-362 as a secondary **WEAKNESS** remains low. CWE-415 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **ROOTCAUSE** (double free) mentioned in the vulnerability description.
