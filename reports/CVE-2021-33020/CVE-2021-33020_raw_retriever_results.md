# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-33020

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-33020

## Query
Philips Vue PACS versions 12.2.x.x and prior uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: use cryptographic key or password past its expiration date
