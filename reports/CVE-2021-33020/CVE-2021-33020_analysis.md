## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that "Philips Vue PACS versions 12.2.x.x and prior **uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date**, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key." This directly matches the description of CWE-324 "Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: "**Root Cause:** The software uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date" and "**Vulnerability:** Use of a key past its expiration date (CWE-324)." The CWE-324 is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction. The Usage is "Allowed" with the rationale "This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-324 has no direct relationships in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match from the vulnerability description and CVE reference).
