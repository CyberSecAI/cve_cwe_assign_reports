# Analysis for CVE-2021-21859

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-197 | Numeric Truncation Error | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is caused by an **integer truncation**.|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The CVE reference links mention Integer Overflow as a related weakness in similar vulnerabilities. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The CVE reference links mention out-of-bounds write as a result of the integer truncation in similar vulnerabilities. |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The CVE reference links mention out-of-bounds read as a result of the integer truncation in similar vulnerabilities. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **integer truncation** vulnerability. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that similar vulnerabilities in the same product and component involve **integer truncation** leading to other weaknesses like integer overflows and out-of-bounds read/write. Therefore, CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error) is the most appropriate primary CWE. While the description doesn't directly state the impact of the truncation, the similar CVEs linked describe that the truncation leads to memory corruption, potentially resulting in code execution. The Retriever Results also indicates CWE-197 as the top candidate with a good combined score. The usage for CWE-197 is ALLOWED. I am also adding CWE-190, CWE-787 and CWE-125 as secondary issues because these were present as weaknesses in the CVE Reference Links.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-197 is a Base level CWE. It can also be related to CWE-681 (Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types), as truncation often occurs during type conversion. The CVE Reference Links also indicate that CWE-197 (Integer Truncation) can lead to integer overflows (CWE-190) and out-of-bounds read/write (CWE-125/CWE-787).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
