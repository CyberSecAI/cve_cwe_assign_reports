## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **integer truncation** vulnerability. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that similar vulnerabilities in the same product and component involve **integer truncation** leading to other weaknesses like integer overflows and out-of-bounds read/write. Therefore, CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error) is the most appropriate primary CWE. While the description doesn't directly state the impact of the truncation, the similar CVEs linked describe that the truncation leads to memory corruption, potentially resulting in code execution. The Retriever Results also indicates CWE-197 as the top candidate with a good combined score. The usage for CWE-197 is ALLOWED. I am also adding CWE-190, CWE-787 and CWE-125 as secondary issues because these were present as weaknesses in the CVE Reference Links.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-197 is a Base level CWE. It can also be related to CWE-681 (Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types), as truncation often occurs during type conversion. The CVE Reference Links also indicate that CWE-197 (Integer Truncation) can lead to integer overflows (CWE-190) and out-of-bounds read/write (CWE-125/CWE-787).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2639** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2639](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2639): Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)

- **CVE-2009-0231** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0231](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0231): Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2008-3282** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3282](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3282): Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-23997**: Due to unexpected data type conversions, a use-after-free could have occurred when interacting with the font cache. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.
- **CVE-2021-37645**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126) uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-37646**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L184) calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies negative `ngram_widths`. The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-44499**: An issue was discovered in FIS GT.M through V7.0-000 (related to the YottaDB code base). Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a call to $Extract to force an signed integer holding the size of a buffer to take on a large negative number, which is then used as the length of a memcpy call that occurs on the stack, causing a buffer overflow.
