| CWE-299 | Improper Check for Certificate Revocation | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper check for certificate revocation**" as the root cause of the vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the vulnerability is due to an "improper check for certificate revocation" and identifies it as a CWE-299 issue. The description of CWE-299, "The product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised," directly matches the **weakness** described in the vulnerability. The impact is a man-in-the-middle attack and eavesdropping, which aligns with the security implications of a compromised certificate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-299 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found. However, the vulnerability can lead to other issues such as eavesdropping or data interception, which are impacts rather than direct weaknesses.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct mention of certificate revocation issue and CVE summary).
