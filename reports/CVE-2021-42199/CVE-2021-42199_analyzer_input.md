# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-42199

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in swftools through 20201222. A **heap buffer overflow** exists in the function swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback() located in swftext.c. It allows an attacker to cause code execution.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **impact:** code execution
- **product:** swftools
- **version:** through 20201222
- **component:** swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback() in swftext.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback` function within the `swftext.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic heap-based buffer overflow, where the code attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory region. This occurs in `swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback` at line 508 of `modules/swftext.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** A successful exploit can overwrite heap memory leading to a variety of outcomes, including:
    - Program crash/termination.
    - Potential arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory.
    - Denial of service.
- **AddressSanitizer reports:** The AddressSanitizer output confirms a heap-buffer-overflow write of size 2 bytes at a specific address. The provided shadow bytes show the memory region where the overflow occurs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SWF File:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted SWF file that triggers the vulnerable code path within `swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback` during font extraction/processing. The provided POC file, `swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback_poc` (available at [https://gitee.com/cxlzff/fuzz-poc/blob/master/swftools/swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback_poc](https://gitee.com/cxlzff/fuzz-poc/blob/master/swftools/swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback_poc)), can likely be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **`swfdump` Utility:** The issue was triggered using the `swfdump` utility, which is part of the swftools suite and it seems that the command ` ./src/swfdump -D @@` was used to trigger the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable `swfdump` utility with a malicious SWF file to process.
- **No special privileges needed:** The vulnerability is triggered at the application level and doesn't seem to require special system privileges.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
- The provided content provides a concrete code location for the vulnerability (`modules/swftext.c:508`).
- Includes AddressSanitizer output which provides details about the type of memory error, specific memory addresses, and a call stack showing the vulnerable function and its callers.
- It includes a reference to a Proof of Concept (POC) file (`swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback_poc`) demonstrating a way to trigger the vulnerability.
- The specific tool and command that trigger the vulnerability (`./src/swfdump -D @@`) are provided.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was reported by user `cxlzff` on Oct 7, 2021.
- This vulnerability was also mentioned in bug report swftools-pdf2swf #184.
