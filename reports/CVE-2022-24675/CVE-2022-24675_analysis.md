# Analysis for CVE-2022-24675

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.95 | Class | Primary | The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by unbounded recursion. |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.70 | Class | Secondary | The stack overflow leads to resource exhaustion. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** in the `encoding/pem` package due to a large amount of PEM data, which directly indicates **uncontrolled recursion**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `decodeError` function is recursively called without proper bounds, leading to the **stack overflow** when processing malformed PEM data. This aligns perfectly with CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion). While CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) are considered by the retriever, the root cause is specifically the unbounded recursion, making CWE-674 the most accurate primary mapping. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is included as a secondary CWE because the stack overflow leads to resource exhaustion, a common impact of uncontrolled recursion. The usage for CWE-674 is "Allowed-with-Review" since it is a Class, but the evidence strongly supports this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is a Class-level CWE. There are no direct relationships found in the provided data. However, uncontrolled recursion inherently leads to resource exhaustion, which is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear vulnerability description and confirming details in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The stack overflow condition caused by the uncontrolled recursion directly leads to the consumption of stack memory, eventually leading to a denial-of-service condition as the program crashes. This makes CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) a relevant secondary weakness, even though the root cause is CWE-674. CWE-400 is a Class, and the usage notes say that it's "Discouraged" and "often misused because it is conflated with the 'technical impact' of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs." However, in this case, it is appropriate because the unbounded recursion (CWE-674) directly and predictably results in the consumption of stack resources.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a Class-level CWE. It's a consequence of the primary weakness, CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate confidence. While the stack overflow results in resource consumption, it is a secondary effect of the uncontrolled recursion.)
