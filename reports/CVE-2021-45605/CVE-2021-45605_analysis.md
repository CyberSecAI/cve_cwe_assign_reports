|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack-based buffer overflow**" which directly corresponds to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which also identifies a stack overflow vulnerability. The retriever results rank CWE-121 as the top match. CWE-121 is a variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance states that CWE-121 is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-787 is a base CWE and could be considered, the explicit mention of stack allocation in the description makes CWE-121 the more accurate and specific choice. CWE-119 is a class and is discouraged when more specific CWEs exist.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
