## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26094:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content mentions `CVE-2022-26094` within the "SMR-APR-2022" section under the description of `SVE-2021-24106`. The description for  `SVE-2021-24106`  states: `Null pointer dereference vulnerability in some parser functions of libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows out of bounds write by remote attackers.`

**2. Vulnerability Details:**
   - **Root Cause:** A null pointer dereference exists in multiple parser functions within the `libsimba` library.
   - **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the affected parser functions of `libsimba` library.
   - **Impact:** This null pointer dereference can lead to an out-of-bounds write, potentially causing a denial of service or other unexpected behavior.
   - **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, as a remote attacker can send crafted input that triggers the vulnerability within the affected `libsimba` parser functions.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input which leads to the null pointer dereference and subsequent out-of-bounds write.

**3. Additional Information**
  - The content also references related CVEs in `SVE-2021-24106` namely `CVE-2022-26093`, `CVE-2022-26095`, `CVE-2022-26096` and `CVE-2022-26097`.

**In summary, the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference flaw in the `libsimba` library that allows a remote attacker to cause an out-of-bounds write by sending crafted input to the affected parsers.**
