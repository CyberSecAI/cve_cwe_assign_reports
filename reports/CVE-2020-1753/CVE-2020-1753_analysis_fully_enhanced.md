# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-1753

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.85 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability lies in how Ansible passes sensitive parameters to `kubectl`. Instead of using secure methods like environment variables or input configuration files, it passes passwords and tokens directly on the command line. This makes the sensitive information visible in process listings. This aligns perfectly with CWE-214 [Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information], which describes a process being invoked with sensitive command-line arguments visible to other processes. Additionally, the vulnerability description and CVE summary specifically mention the exposure of credentials through the process list, reinforcing this mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-214 indicates this is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-214 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere]. While CWE-497 is a parent, CWE-214 is more specific to the vulnerability. CWE-214 is PEEROF itself."

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability also leads to sensitive information being written to log files. The `no_log` directive in Ansible's debug module is ineffective in preventing this because the sensitive parameters are passed to `kubectl` as command-line arguments. This aligns with CWE-532 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File], which describes a product writing sensitive information to a log file. The CVE summary explicitly mentions the disclosure of secrets in log files. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-532 indicates this is ALLOWED."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-532 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]. While CWE-200 is a parent, CWE-532 is more specific to the vulnerability."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence for CWE-214: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
  - Confidence for CWE-532: 0.85 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-1753**: A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17, all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7, when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being disclosed on stdout and log files.
- **CVE-2021-32638**: Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.
- **CVE-2022-31238**: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.0.0 up to and including 9.1.0.19, 9.2.1.12, 9.3.0.6, and 9.4.0.2, contain a process invoked with sensitive information vulnerability. A CLI user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to information disclosure.
