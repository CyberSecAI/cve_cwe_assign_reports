# Final Resolution for CVE-2020-21992

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves injecting OS commands via unsanitized input, directly matching CWE-78. |
| CWE-1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the POST parameter; the data was not validated based on type requirements. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**), which is a base-level CWE. It's more specific than its parent CWE-77 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**) and grandparent CWE-74 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements**). The secondary CWE is CWE-1287 (**Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input**), which is also a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**). The relationship shows that the lack of proper input validation (CWE-1287) leads to OS command injection (CWE-78).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **par POST parameter not being sanitized**, which is a failure of input validation (**ROOTCAUSE: CWE-1287**). This allows an attacker to inject special elements into the OS command. When the `system()` function is called, the injected commands are executed, resulting in OS command injection (**WEAKNESS: CWE-78**). The impact is the ability to remotely execute system commands as the root user, bypassing access controls.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identifies CWE-78 as the primary weakness due to the OS command injection. The criticism suggests replacing CWE-116 with CWE-1287, which is a more accurate representation of the root cause which is the lack of input validation for the type of the input. This is supported by the vulnerability description which states the **par POST parameter is not sanitized**.
The graph relationships confirm that CWE-1287 leads to CWE-78.

The final decision is to classify the vulnerability as CWE-78 (primary) and CWE-1287 (secondary). This provides a more complete picture of the vulnerability, from root cause to impact, and is supported by both the vulnerability description and the CWE relationships. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they are both base-level CWEs.
