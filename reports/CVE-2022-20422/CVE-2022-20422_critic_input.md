- **product:** Android kernel
- **component:** emulation_proc_handler of armv8_deprecated.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20422:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a race condition in the instruction emulator for 64-bit Arm systems.
- Concurrent changes to the sysctls (system control variables) that control the emulator can lead to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper synchronization when modifying sysctls related to the ARMv8 emulator, allowing concurrent access.
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The race condition leads to a state where the kernel attempts to dereference a null pointer, causing a crash. Specifically, the `table->data` pointer is modified concurrently, leading to use of an invalid pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a kernel crash due to the null pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Unclear Security Impact:** The Debian security advisory mentions the security impact is unclear, as it only leads to a kernel crash. However, the potential for further exploitation is present if the crash occurs in a vulnerable area.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker who can make concurrent changes to the sysctls controlling the emulator.
- **Sysctl Modification:** The attacker must be able to modify the sysctl values related to the instruction emulator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to have local user access to the system to modify the necessary sysctl variables.
- **Concurrency:** The attacker needs the ability to execute operations that change the sysctl values concurrently to trigger the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves using `container_of()` to retrieve the `insn` pointer and adding a mutex to protect against the `current_mode` update, but not for retrieving `insn_emulation` because `table->data` is no longer changing.
- The fix was backported from a kernel patch.
- The Debian advisory mentions that the vulnerability is located in the "instruction emulator for 64-bit Arm systems", which aligns with the AOSP commit message mentioning "arm64: fix oops in concurrently setting insn_emulation sysctl".

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The primary weakness is a **race condition** described in the "Vulnerability Description" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary". The summary specifies concurrent access leading to a **null pointer dereference**. CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**')) is a Class-level CWE that accurately captures the essence of the **race condition**. CWE-412 (Unpredictable/Probable Concurrent Access to Critical Section) might be too specific without more details on the concurrent access pattern. CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) describes the impact, rather than the root cause, which is the **race condition**. The fix involves using a mutex, pointing to a synchronization issue.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-362 is a Class, and ideally, a more specific Base or Variant CWE would be preferred. However, given the information, CWE-362 is the most suitable high-level classification of the **race condition**. CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) is a consequence of the **race condition** and is related as an impact.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence based on the description of a **race condition** leading to memory corruption and confirmed by the CVE reference link).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** In languages that support it, use synchronization primitives. Only wrap these around critical code to minimize the impact on performance.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use thread-safe capabilities such as the data access abstraction in Spring.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Minimize the usage of shared resources in order to remove as much complexity as possible from the control flow and to reduce the likelihood of unexpected conditions occurring.


Additionally, this will minimize the amount of synchronization necessary and may even help to reduce the likelihood of a denial of service where an attacker may be able to repeatedly trigger a critical section (CWE-400).




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
NPD: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference
null deref: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Dereference
NPE: Common abbreviation for Null Pointer Exception
nil pointer dereference: used for access of nil in Go programs

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-710
ChildOf -> CWE-754
ChildOf -> CWE-754
CanFollow -> CWE-1325
CanFollow -> CWE-252
CanFollow -> CWE-362
CanFollow -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If all pointers that could have been modified are checked for NULL before use, nearly all NULL pointer dereferences can be prevented.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Select a programming language that is not susceptible to these issues.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is non-null before acting upon it.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.
- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference
- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference



## CWE-412: Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product properly checks for the existence of a lock, but the lock can be externally controlled or influenced by an actor that is outside of the intended sphere of control.

### Extended Description
This prevents the product from acting on associated resources or performing other behaviors that are controlled by the presence of the lock. Relevant locks might include an exclusive lock or mutex, or modifying a shared resource that is treated as a lock. If the lock can be held for an indefinite period of time, then the denial of service could be permanent.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-667
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-410

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Use any access control that is offered by the functionality that is offering the lock.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Use unpredictable names or identifiers for the locks. This might not always be possible or feasible.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider modifying your code to use non-blocking synchronization methods.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This overlaps Insufficient Resource Pool when the "pool" is of size 1. It can also be resultant from race conditions, although the timing window could be quite large in some cases.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0682:** Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.
- **CVE-2002-1914:** Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.
- **CVE-2002-1915:** Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.
