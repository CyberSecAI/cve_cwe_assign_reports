  "query": "Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request `curl -d array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100) do echo -n [_0][0][array] done)[string][_0]=hello%20world http//localhost8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.",
