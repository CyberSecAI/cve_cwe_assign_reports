## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **"small space of random values"** in the FortiSandbox RPC API, which directly aligns with CWE-334 (Small Space of Random Values). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms that the root cause is the insufficient randomness used for generating session IDs, making them predictable. This aligns perfectly with CWE-334's description: "The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks." The impact, as stated, is that an attacker could **"predict valid session IDs,"** which further validates the relevance of CWE-334. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-334 indicates that it is ALLOWED, which strengthens the selection of this CWE. CWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) and CWE-339 (Small Seed Space in PRNG) are considered as secondary candidates because they address aspects of predictability, but CWE-334 provides a more precise match to the core weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-334 is a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), which is a Class-level CWE. While CWE-330 is relevant, CWE-334 is a more specific Base-level CWE that better represents the vulnerability. CWE-341 (Predictable from Observable State) shares a PEEROF relationship with CWE-339 (Small Seed Space in PRNG), indicating that the predictability could be influenced by observable states. The relationship analysis supports the selection of CWE-334 as the primary weakness with possible contributions from CWE-341.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, combined with MITRE mapping guidance).



## Known Examples for CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0583** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0583](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0583): Product uses 5 alphanumeric characters for filenames of expense claim reports, stored under web root.
- **CVE-2002-0903** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0903](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0903): Product uses small number of random numbers for a code to approve an action, and also uses predictable new user IDs, allowing attackers to hijack new accounts.
- **CVE-2003-1230** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1230](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1230): SYN cookies implementation only uses 32-bit keys, making it easier to brute force ISN.
- **CVE-2004-0230** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0230](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0230): Complex predictability / randomness (reduced space).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-26098**: An instance of small space of random values in the RPC API of FortiSandbox before 4.0.0 may allow an attacker in possession of a few information pieces about the state of the device to possibly predict valid session IDs.
- **CVE-2021-26909**: Automox Agent prior to version 31 uses an insufficiently protected S3 bucket endpoint for storing sensitive files, which could be brute-forced by an attacker to subvert an organization's security program. The issue has since been fixed in version 31 of the Automox Agent.
- **CVE-2021-44151**: An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. As the session cookies are small, an attacker can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application (e.g., /goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized content, when a valid cookie value is hit.
- **CVE-2022-3959**: A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in drogon up to 1.8.1. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component Session Hash Handler. The manipulation leads to small space of random values. The attack may be launched remotely. Upgrading to version 1.8.2 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is c0d48da99f66aaada17bcd28b07741cac8697647. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213464.


## Known Examples for CWE-341: Predictable from Observable State
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0389** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0389](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0389): Mail server stores private mail messages with predictable filenames in a world-executable directory, which allows local users to read private mailing list archives.
- **CVE-2001-1141** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1141](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1141): PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.
