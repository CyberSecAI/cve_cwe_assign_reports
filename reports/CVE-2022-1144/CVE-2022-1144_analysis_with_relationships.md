# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-1144 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in WebUI in Google Chrome" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the "**root_cause**: Use after free in WebUI." This directly aligns with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which is a Variant level of abstraction and is the preferred level. The description also mentions "**heap corruption**" as a weakness, which is a common consequence of a use-after-free vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as a candidate. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-416 can lead to other weaknesses, such as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) or CWE-415 (Double Free), the primary weakness here is the use-after-free condition itself.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference)
