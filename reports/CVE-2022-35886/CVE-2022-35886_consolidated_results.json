  "query": "Four format string injection vulnerabilities exist in the web interface /action/wirelessConnect functionality of Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit 6.9Z and 6.9X. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from format string injection via the `default_key_id` and `key` HTTP parameters, as used within the `/action/wirelessConnect` handler.",
