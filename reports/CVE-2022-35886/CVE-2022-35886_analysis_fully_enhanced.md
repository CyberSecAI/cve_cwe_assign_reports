# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-134 | Use of Externally-Controlled Format String | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states the existence of **format string injection** vulnerabilities in the `/action/wirelessConnect` functionality of Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit. The root cause, as confirmed by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, is that the `log` function, which uses `vsnprintf`, is being misused, leading to a **format string vulnerability** because the `format` parameter is populated with attacker-controlled data. CWE-134 (Use of Externally-Controlled Format String) directly addresses this issue, as it describes a scenario where a format string originates from an external source, which is precisely the case here with HTTP parameters `default_key_id` and `key`. The usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were provided but based on the vulnerability details, the attacker controlled data used in a format string leads to memory corruption, information disclosure and denial of service.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The description provides explicit details and the summary confirms the root cause and attack vector.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32785**: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled.
- **CVE-2021-33886**: An improper sanitization of input vulnerability in B. Braun SpaceCom2 prior to 012U000062 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain user-level command-line access by passing a raw external string straight through to printf statements. The attacker is required to be on the same network as the device.
- **CVE-2022-33938**: A format string injection vulnerability exists in the ghome_process_control_packet functionality of Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit 6.9Z and 6.9X. A specially-crafted XCMD can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker can send a malicious XML payload to trigger this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2022-35244**: A format string injection vulnerability exists in the XCMD getVarHA functionality of abode systems, inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit 6.9X and 6.9Z. A specially-crafted XCMD can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service. An attacker can send a malicious XML payload to trigger this vulnerability.
