# Critic Input for CVE-2022-36063



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all Azure RTOS ThreadXsupported processors. Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https//github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer underflow and buffer overflow**
- **impact:** remote code execution and denial of service
- **product:** Azure RTOS USBX
- **component:** _ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36063:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function within the Azure RTOS USBX library. It stems from insufficient validation of the MAC address string descriptor length received from a USB CDC ECM device. Specifically, the code doesn't properly check for unexpectedly small string lengths (0 or 1), which leads to an integer underflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Integer Underflow:** When the MAC address string descriptor length is set to 0 or 1, a calculation involving this length results in an integer underflow.
2.  **Buffer Overflow:** The integer underflow is followed by a buffer overflow. The underflow affects the calculation of how much data to read into `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id`, a fixed-size array.  The insufficient bounds check causes the copy operation to write past the end of this array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker might be able to overwrite critical parts of memory, redirect the code execution flow, and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A less sophisticated attack might simply crash the device by causing a memory access violation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious USB Device:** An attacker would need to control a malicious USB device acting as a CDC ECM device.
*   **Manipulated String Descriptor:** The malicious device would send a crafted USB descriptor that contains a MAC address string descriptor with a length of 0 or 1.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable device to plug in the malicious USB device.
*   **USB Device Control:** The attacker must have the ability to create and control a USB device that can enumerate as a CDC ECM device and send crafted descriptors.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable function is located in `ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get.c`.
*   The fix involves improved validation of the MAC address string descriptor length to check for unexpectedly small values.
*   The vulnerability is present in USBX versions prior to 6.1.12.
*   The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-36063 details a vulnerability in Azure RTOS USBX where an attacker can cause a buffer overflow by providing a specially crafted USB descriptor with an invalid MAC address string descriptor length. This could potentially lead to remote code execution or denial of service.

The content provides much more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an **integer underflow** followed by a **buffer overflow** in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that setting the MAC address string descriptor length to 0 or 1 allows for an integer underflow. This underflow then leads to a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This aligns with CWE-191 (Integer Underflow) as the primary weakness and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as the subsequent issue. CWE-191 is a Base level CWE, and its usage is ALLOWED. CWE-122 is a variant of buffer overflow, specified to be on the heap, which matches the description details. The provided description contains enough evidence to support this classification.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-191 has no direct relationships, but it CanPrecede CWE-119 due to the integer underflow leading to memory corruption. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The relationship reflects that the integer underflow sets the stage for a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of integer underflow and buffer overflow, supported by detailed CVE reference content)

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.

- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.
