# Analysis for CVE-2021-35090

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is directly caused by a TOCTOU race condition. |
| CWE-413 | Improper Resource Locking | 0.3 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. A race condition often stems from the lack of proper locking mechanisms, but the primary issue here is the TOCTOU condition. |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.2 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The description mentions a race condition, but doesn't elaborate on the concurrency aspect. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**TOC TOU race condition** when updating address mappings" which maps directly to CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition). This CWE describes a scenario where the state of a resource is checked before use, but changes before it is actually used, leading to invalid actions. The **hypervisor memory corruption** is a direct consequence of this race condition, reinforcing the selection of CWE-367. The description mentions a race condition during address mapping updates, but does not specify any details about locking so CWE-413 is lower confidence. CWE-362 is even lower because it's a class-level CWE, and CWE-367 is more specific and describes the TOCTOU race.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-367 doesn't have direct relationships to the other CWEs, but CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) is a child of CWE-667 (Missing Mutex) and might be relevant since proper locking could mitigate the TOCTOU condition.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence due to explicit mention of TOCTOU race condition and its impact on memory corruption)
