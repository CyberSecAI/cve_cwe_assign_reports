# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-4093

## Vulnerability Description
**A flaw was found in the KVMs AMD code for supporting the Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES)**. A KVM guest using SEV-ES can trigger out-of-bounds reads and writes in the host kernel via a malicious VMGEXIT for a string I/O instruction (for example, outs or ins) using the exit reason SVM_EXIT_IOIO. This issue results in a crash of the entire system or a potential guest-to-host escape scenario.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described as CVE-2021-4093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read/write in the `sev_es_string_io` function within the Linux kernel's KVM implementation when handling string I/O operations for SEV-ES guests. Specifically, the guest can provide a length that, when used with the I/O access size, will cause a memory copy operation to exceed the allocated buffer in the hypervisor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Out-of-bounds Read/Write:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking when handling string I/O operations. A malicious guest can provide a large size and/or count, leading to `memcpy` operations that overflow the allocated buffer for the guestâ€™s data within the hypervisor.
2. **Incorrect Size Calculation:** The `sev_es_string_io` function was incorrectly treating the REP count (from `SW_EXITINFO2`) as the size of the GHCB buffer, leading to the possibility of a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **System Crash:** The most immediate impact is a potential crash of the entire host system due to the memory corruption caused by out-of-bounds access.
2.  **Guest-to-Host Escape:** There is a potential, although less immediate, risk of a guest-to-host escape scenario if the memory corruption leads to control-flow hijacking or other exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Malicious Guest:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious KVM guest using the SEV-ES feature.
2.  **String I/O Instructions:** The attack uses string I/O instructions (like `outs` or `ins`) within the guest.
3.  **VMGEXIT:** The malicious activity is triggered by a `VMGEXIT` with the exit reason `SVM_EXIT_IOIO`. This exit leads to handling of the string I/O operation within the hypervisor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **KVM Guest:** The attacker must have the ability to run a KVM virtual machine with the SEV-ES feature enabled on the vulnerable host.
2.  **Control over Guest Memory:** The attacker needs to have control over the guest's memory space to craft a malicious string I/O request that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The `sev_es_string_io` function copies data from unencrypted guest memory into the GHCB using guest-controlled values for length and I/O size.
*   The hypervisor copies data into `vcpu->arch.pio_data` which has a fixed one-page size buffer. If the size of the operation exceeds one page, it results in an out-of-bounds read/write.
* The fix involves iterating over the `sev_pio_data` buffer in multiple passes if necessary, to ensure no out of bound write happens.
