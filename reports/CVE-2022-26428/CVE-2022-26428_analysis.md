# Analysis for CVE-2022-26428

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.85 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The vulnerability is caused by a **race condition** due to concurrent execution using shared resources without proper synchronization. |
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.70 | Variant | Allowed | The **memory corruption** can potentially lead to a use-after-free scenario. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that there is a **memory corruption** due to a **race condition** in the video codec. This directly aligns with CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), which describes vulnerabilities arising from concurrent access to shared resources without proper synchronization mechanisms. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms that the root cause is concurrent execution using shared resources without proper synchronization. Although CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is also a relevant candidate, CWE-362 is a better fit because the description emphasizes concurrent execution without proper synchronization, which is the core issue described by CWE-362. CWE-362 is a Class, but there isn't enough information to determine a more specific Base CWE. While "memory corruption" is the weakness, the underlying cause is the race condition.
  The use of CWE-362 is "Allowed-with-Review" because it's a Class, but a more specific entry is not available based on the information provided.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-362 is a Class weakness. Its children include CWE-364 (Signal Handler Race Condition), CWE-667 (Improper Locking), and CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread). The description doesn't provide enough detail to determine which of these child CWEs is the most applicable. CWE-362 can lead to other weaknesses, such as CWE-416 (Use After Free) or CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition), depending on the specifics of the memory corruption.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference content)
