## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the **rootcause**. The CVE reference link content summary also confirms "**Use after free**" as the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a variant level CWE and perfectly matches the vulnerability description. The description also mentions "**heap corruption**" as the impact, which is consistent with the potential consequences of a use-after-free vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED for use after free vulnerabilities.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The vulnerability description and CVE reference materials clearly indicate a use-after-free condition)
