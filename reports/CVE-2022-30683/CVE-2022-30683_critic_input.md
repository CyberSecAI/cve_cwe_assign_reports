# Critic Input for CVE-2022-30683



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.13.0 (and earlier) is affected by a Violation of Secure Design Principles vulnerability that could lead to bypass the security feature of the encryption mechanism in the backend . An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to decrypt secrets, however, this is a high-complexity attack as the threat actor needs to already possess those secrets. Exploitation of this issue requires low-privilege access to AEM.

# Analysis to Review
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**violation of secure design principles**" which directly aligns with CWE-657. The impact of this **weakness** is the ability to "decrypt secrets," indicating a failure in the overall architecture or design of the security mechanisms. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary corroborates this by stating "root_cause": "Violation of Secure Design Principles" and listing "CWE-657" as a **weakness**. Given that the attacker needs to already possess the secrets to decrypt them, a likely secondary **weakness** is CWE-312, where sensitive information is stored in cleartext, making the decryption possible. However, the primary issue is with the flawed design, which enables this decryption in the first place. The retriever results also lists CWE-657 as one of the matches. The mapping guidance for CWE-657 is DISCOURAGED but I am overriding the recommendation as it's the root cause as documented by the CVE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-657 is a Class-level CWE, and as such, MITRE recommends looking for more specific CWEs. However, in this case, the specific secure design violation isn't further elaborated upon, making CWE-657 the most appropriate high-level categorization. It is related to other CWEs that describe specific design flaws, but without more context, this is the best fit. CWE-312 is related as a possible vulnerability that could be exploited in conjunction with CWE-657.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, System Configuration, Operation
- **Description:** When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to encrypt the data at rest. [REF-1297] [REF-1299] [REF-1301]



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions



## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

### Extended Description
This can introduce resultant weaknesses or make it easier for developers to introduce related weaknesses during implementation. Because code is centered around design, it can be resource-intensive to fix design problems.

### Alternative Terms
None

ParentOf -> CWE-654

ParentOf -> CWE-671

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-6260:** Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) device implements Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) bridges that do not require authentication for arbitrary read and write access to the BMC's physical address space from the host, and possibly the network [REF-1138].
- **CVE-2007-5277:** The failure of connection attempts in a web browser resets DNS pin restrictions. An attacker can then bypass the same origin policy by rebinding a domain name to a different IP address. This was an attempt to "fail functional."
- **CVE-2006-7142:** Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.
