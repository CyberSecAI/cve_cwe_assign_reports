## Vulnerability Description
Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.13.0 (and earlier) is affected by a Violation of Secure Design Principles vulnerability that could lead to bypass the security feature of the encryption mechanism in the backend . An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to decrypt secrets, however, this is a high-complexity attack as the threat actor needs to already possess those secrets. Exploitation of this issue requires low-privilege access to AEM.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **violation of secure design principles**
- **impact:** decrypt secrets
- **attacker:** low-privilege attacker
- **product:** Adobe Experience Manager
- **version:** 6.5.13.0 and earlier
