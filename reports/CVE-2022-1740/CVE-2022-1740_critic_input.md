### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **self-attestation mechanisms**
- **impact:** disguise malicious applications
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast Xs
- **version:** tested version
- **component:** on-screen application hash display feature and audit log export and application export functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-1740:

**Vulnerability:** Mutable Attestation or Measurement Reporting Data (CWE-1283)

**Root Cause:** The ImageCast X's on-screen application hash display, audit log export, and application export features rely on self-attestation mechanisms. This means the device is essentially vouching for its own integrity, and this information can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The system relies on self-attestation mechanisms for verifying application integrity, audit logs, and application exports. This means the device generates its own reports, without a trusted external authority verifying them.
*   The displayed application hash, audit logs, and application exports can be altered by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can disguise malicious applications installed on the device. By manipulating the displayed hash and exported audit logs, an attacker can make malicious software appear legitimate.
*   Compromised device reports would not reflect the presence of malicious code, making detection difficult.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Physical access to individual ImageCast X devices.
*   Modification of files before they are uploaded to ImageCast X devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Physical access to an ImageCast X device is required to manipulate the self-attestation mechanisms.
*   The attacker needs to be able to modify files that are to be uploaded to ImageCast X devices.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to tamper with the ImageCast X's self-generated reports (hashes, audit logs, and application exports), masking the presence of malicious software. This self-attestation mechanism is inherently insecure. The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can hide malicious applications by manipulating the device's integrity reporting features, making them difficult to detect through standard means.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1283: Mutable Attestation or Measurement Reporting Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The register contents used for attestation or measurement reporting data to verify boot flow are modifiable by an adversary.

### Extended Description


A System-on-Chip (SoC) implements secure boot or verified boot. During this boot flow, the SoC often measures the code that it authenticates. The measurement is usually done by calculating the one-way hash of the code binary and extending it to the previous hash. The hashing algorithm should be a Secure One-Way hash function. The final hash, i.e., the value obtained after the completion of the boot flow, serves as the measurement data used in reporting or in attestation. The calculated hash is often stored in registers that can later be read by the party of interest to determine tampering of the boot flow. A common weakness is that the contents in these registers are modifiable by an adversary, thus spoofing the measurement.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Measurement data should be stored in registers that are read-only or otherwise have access controls that prevent modification by an untrusted agent.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still in development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.





## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description


Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:


  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)

  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)

When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:


  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.



### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.

**[Maintenance]** 

This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:


  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)

  - Group can perform undesired actions
