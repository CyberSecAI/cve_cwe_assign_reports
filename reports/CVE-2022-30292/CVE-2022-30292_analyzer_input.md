# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-30292

## Vulnerability Description
**Heap-based buffer overflow** in sqbaselib.cpp in SQUIRREL 3.2 due to **lack of a certain sq_reservestack call**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of a certain sq_reservestack call**
- **weakness:** **Heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** SQUIRREL
- **version:** 3.2
- **component:** sqbaselib.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-30292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing `sq_reservestack` call within the `thread_call` function located in `sqbaselib.cpp` of the Squirrel scripting language.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The lack of stack reservation via `sq_reservestack` before manipulating the stack within the `thread_call` function can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when the function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A heap overflow can cause a crash or make the application unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential Sandbox Escape and Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially escape sandboxes in applications using Squirrel and achieve arbitrary code execution, although this is not definitively stated and may depend on how the scripting language is used in the target application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Squirrel bytecode/source files:** Exploitation requires running specially crafted Squirrel bytecode or source files, which contains malicious code to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Delivery through application:** This malicious code can be delivered to a target system through various means, including:
  - Server-sent game maps containing malicious Squirrel scripts.
  - Malicious game mods.
- **Unspecified user interaction:** The provided content does not specify if user interaction is always needed, but it can be triggered by a server that sends data to the client or through a game mod

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to supply malicious squirrel code:** The attacker needs to be able to inject or have a way for the vulnerable application to execute crafted Squirrel bytecode or source code. This can be done by an attacker who controls a server or by an attacker providing malicious game mods.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes mentions of fixes in Fedora updates for the `squirrel` package and `supertux` (a game that uses Squirrel), confirming that the vulnerability is actively being addressed in real-world applications.
- The commit link provided shows the actual fix of adding a call to `sq_reservestack` within the `thread_call` function.
- The vulnerability is described as being present in Squirrel version 3.2 and below, so a fix would be required for older versions of this library.

This detailed breakdown should provide a clear understanding of CVE-2022-30292.
