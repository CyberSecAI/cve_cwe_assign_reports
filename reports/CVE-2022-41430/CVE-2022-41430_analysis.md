## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**heap overflow** via the AP4_BitReaderReadBit function in mp4mux". The CVE reference links confirm this by stating "Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit()`" and describing it as a case where the function "appears to not properly handle cases where it attempts to read past the end of allocated buffer, resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow." CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant level CWE that specifically describes buffer overflows occurring in the heap, which directly matches the vulnerability description. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a parent, CWE-122 is a specific subtype. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-122 is ALLOWED for heap-based buffer overflows.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and a parent of several more specific buffer overflow types. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-122 is directly relevant.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
