# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "Heap **buffer overflow** in GPU" leading to potential heap corruption. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this scenario, where a buffer overflow occurs in the heap memory region. The **root cause** is clearly a **buffer overflow**, making CWE-122 a precise fit. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a related CWE, as it describes the general condition of writing data past the end of a buffer. However, since the description specifies "heap," CWE-122 is more specific and thus preferred. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating "Heap buffer overflow in GPU". The "weaknesses" section also lists "Heap buffer overflow."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), providing a more specific classification related to heap memory. CWE-787 is a parent of CWE-122.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the description and CVE reference materials.)
