# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-821 | Incorrect Synchronization | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-662 | Improper Synchronization | 0.50 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-820 | Missing Synchronization | 0.50 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as **"Incorrect Synchronization"** in the polonel/trudesk repository. The analysis of the commit and code changes in `src/controllers/api/v1/messages.js` confirms this, highlighting a problem with message owner assignment where the owner was being overwritten. This indicates a **lack of proper synchronization** or a logic error in how the message object was being created and updated. This aligns directly with CWE-821 (Incorrect Synchronization), which is a Base-level CWE and therefore preferred. CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged. Although CWE-820 (Missing Synchronization) is a candidate, CWE-821 better describes the vulnerability because it involves a more specific form of synchronization issue (incorrect vs. missing). The commit message "fix(messages): validation check" also supports that the intention of the fix was related to the validation check within the message logic, indicating a synchronization problem.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-821 is a base level weakness. CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) is a parent of CWE-821, but is a class-level weakness, making CWE-821 a more specific choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials specifying the synchronization issue in owner assignment.)



## Known Examples for CWE-662: Improper Synchronization
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1782](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1782): Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0935](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0935): Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-25668**: A flaw was found in Linux Kernel because access to the global variable fg_console is not properly synchronized leading to a use after free in con_font_op.
- **CVE-2021-25376**: An improper synchronization logic in Samsung Email prior to version 6.1.41.0 can leak messages in certain mailbox in plain text when STARTTLS negotiation is failed.
- **CVE-2021-36305**: Dell PowerScale OneFS contains an Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context in SMB CA handling. An authenticated user of SMB on a cluster with CA could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a denial of service over SMB.
- **CVE-2022-2962**: A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the Tulip device emulation in QEMU. When Tulip reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx frame, it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO handlers multiple times, possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2022-32609**: In vcu, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07203410; Issue ID: ALPS07203410.
- **CVE-2022-32610**: In vcu, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07203476; Issue ID: ALPS07203476.
- **CVE-2022-32642**: In ccd, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07326547; Issue ID: ALPS07326547.
- **CVE-2022-32643**: In ccd, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS07341261; Issue ID: ALPS07341261.
