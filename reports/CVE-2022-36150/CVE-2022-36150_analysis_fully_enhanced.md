| CWE-789 | Uncontrolled Memory Allocation | 0.65 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **heap-buffer overflow** in tifig v0.2.2, which directly corresponds to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). The CVE reference links content summary supports this, indicating that the root cause is a **heap buffer overflow** triggered in the `__asan_memmove` function during a vector insert operation due to a large size parameter. This confirms that the overflow occurs in the heap memory region. The retriever results also list CWE-122 as a candidate, reinforcing this selection. The description indicates the overflow leads to program crash. MITRE mapping guidance indicates CWE-122 is ALLOWED.
  - Further investigation reveals that the **heap buffer overflow** occurs due to a large size parameter, this suggests that CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) or CWE-789 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation) may contribute to the root cause, by resulting in a smaller buffer than expected. CWE-131 is ranked highly in the retriever results, which reinforces this candidate. CWE-789 is a variant weakness where the product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated. This may be occurring as a result of the large size parameter.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-131 is related to buffer overflows as it describes the incorrect calculation of the buffer size. CWE-789 can lead to memory exhaustion, which can precede buffer overflows.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence of **heap buffer overflow** and supporting details in the CVE reference links content summary)

## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
