# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-46507 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Improper Control of Recursion | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** condition, which is triggered by excessive recursion within the `Jsi_LogMsg` function in `src/jsiUtils.c`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, highlighting "Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion" and "Improper handling of specific input data, causing infinite recursion". CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion) directly addresses the scenario where a product "does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place, consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack." The attack involves crafted Javascript, which triggers recursive calls between `Jsi_LogMsg` and `Jsi_ValueToString`. CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and while a more specific Base-level child might be ideal, none of the retriever results provide a better fit given the root cause is the lack of recursion control rather than a specific type of buffer overflow. The usage is "Allowed-with-Review", which acknowledges the need to check for more specific children. Given the evidence, CWE-674 is the most appropriate primary mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* Although CWE-674 does not have direct relationships listed in the provided data, it is conceptually related to resource management issues. The stack overflow is a direct consequence of the uncontrolled recursion.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to clear description of stack overflow caused by uncontrolled recursion and supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary)
