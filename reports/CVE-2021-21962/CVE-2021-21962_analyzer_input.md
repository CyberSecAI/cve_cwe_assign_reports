# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21962

## Vulnerability Description
A **heap-based buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in the OTA Update u-download functionality of Sealevel Systems, Inc. SeaConnect 370W v1.3.34. A series of specially-crafted MQTT payloads can lead to remote code execution. An attacker must perform a man-in-the-middle attack in order to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **vector:** series of specially-crafted MQTT payloads
- **product:** Sealevel Systems SeaConnect 370W
- **version:** v1.3.34
- **component:** OTA Update u-download functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `unescape` function used during the processing of the "u-download" OTA update command. The `unescape` function doesn't check the size of the input string, causing a buffer overflow when the unescaped string is larger than the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122). The `unescape` function acts like `strcpy` but without checking the size of the source string. This allows an attacker to overwrite heap metadata.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. By corrupting heap metadata, an attacker can control the pointer returned by subsequent calls to `malloc`. This allows a write-what-where primitive to overwrite arbitrary instructions and gain remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via specially crafted MQTT payloads sent to the device's command channel. Specifically, the "payload" field of the JSON message associated with the "u-download" command is exploited.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify the MQTT communication between the device and the "Sealevel SeaCloud". They must also have the ability to send crafted MQTT messages to the device.
