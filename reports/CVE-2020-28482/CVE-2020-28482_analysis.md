## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that this affects the package fastify-csrf before 3.0.0 due to two reasons: 1. The generated cookie used insecure defaults, and did not have the httpOnly flag on cookieOpts { path /, sameSite true } 2. The **CSRF token was available in the GET query parameter**, which is a clear indication of a **CSRF vulnerability**. Therefore, CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) is the most appropriate primary CWE. The presence of the cookie without the `httpOnly` flag contributes to potential exposure of the token, thus CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag) is a secondary contributing weakness. The lack of `httpOnly` flag also can cause a **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability (CWE-79), hence, it's added as a secondary CWE. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-352 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) is related to CWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute) since improper cookie settings can lead to CSRF. CWE-352 Requires weaknesses such as CWE-613, CWE-642, CWE-441, and CWE-346. CWE-1004 and CWE-79 are potential root causes that can enable or worsen CSRF attacks."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
