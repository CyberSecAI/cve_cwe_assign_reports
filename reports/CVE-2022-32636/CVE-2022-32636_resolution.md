# Final Resolution for CVE-2022-32636

# Summary 
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Primary | The vulnerability description clearly indicates an out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow. |
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.85 | Base | Secondary | The vulnerability description indicates that an integer overflow is the root cause of the out-of-bounds write. |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.50 | Base | Informational | The integer overflow likely resulted in an incorrect buffer size calculation, but the description focuses on the overflow itself and the resulting out-of-bounds write, making CWE-190 and CWE-787 more direct mappings. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.92
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The analysis hinges on the direct relationships described in the vulnerability: an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) leading to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-190 can precede CWE-787. While CWE-131 is also related, it's less directly mentioned in the description. The Base abstraction level of all three CWEs is appropriate for root cause analysis.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190). This **overflow** leads to an incorrect calculation of a buffer size (potentially CWE-131), resulting in an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The final impact is local escalation of privilege.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis and the criticism both converge on CWE-787 and CWE-190 as the primary and secondary weaknesses, respectively. The vulnerability description explicitly states "out of bounds write due to an integer overflow," providing strong evidence for this classification.

The addition of CWE-131 as informational provides a more complete picture, acknowledging that the **integer overflow** likely resulted in an incorrect buffer size calculation, even if it wasn't explicitly stated.

The relationships between these CWEs (CWE-190 preceding CWE-787) reinforce the vulnerability chain. Selecting CWEs at the Base level of abstraction ensures optimal specificity. The final decision is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description, considered in the context of the relationships between the identified CWEs.
