```markdown
# Summary 
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Primary | The vulnerability description clearly indicates an out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow. |
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.85 | Base | Secondary | The vulnerability description indicates that an integer overflow is the root cause of the out-of-bounds write. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH


- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**out of bounds write** due to an **integer overflow**". This directly aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which describes a condition where data is written past the end of the intended buffer. The **integer overflow**, which is the **root cause**, is best represented by CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). CWE-787 is selected as the primary CWE as it's the direct consequence of the overflow. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this root cause and weakness relationship.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-190 can precede CWE-787 as an integer overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links).
