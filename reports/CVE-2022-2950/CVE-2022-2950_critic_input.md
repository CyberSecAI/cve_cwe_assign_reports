## Vulnerability Description
Altair HyperView Playerversions 2021.1.0.27 and priorare vulnerable to the **use of uninitialized memory** vulnerability during parsing of H3D files. A DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer and, after sign extension, is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter leading to memory corruption.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of uninitialized memory**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **product:** Altair HyperView Player
- **version:** 2021.1.0.27 and prior

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-2950.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the use of uninitialized memory during the parsing of H3D files. Specifically, a DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer, and after sign extension, this value is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter. This leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908)

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption and a crash of the device accessing the file.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves parsing a malicious H3D file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted H3D file to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to have a user execute this file on a vulnerable system. The attack vector is local, which means the attacker likely needs access to the machine.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the **use of uninitialized memory** as the root cause, leading to memory corruption. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by identifying **Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908)** as a key weakness. A DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer and used as an index to increment a counter, which then causes memory corruption due to an out-of-bounds write. Therefore, CWE-908 is a direct fit for the root cause. The subsequent memory corruption due to the incorrect index leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) is a base-level CWE. The retriever results confirm its appropriateness with a high score. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a consequence of using the uninitialized value, and has a strong supporting score from the retriever. CWE-787 can be preceded by CWE-908, as the uninitialized resource leads to writing outside the intended buffer.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary for CWE-908).
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary for CWE-787 as a secondary weakness).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description
When a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ParentOf -> CWE-457
CanFollow -> CWE-909

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Explicitly initialize the resource before use. If this is performed through an API function or standard procedure, follow all required steps.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Pay close attention to complex conditionals that affect initialization, since some branches might not perform the initialization.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Avoid race conditions (CWE-362) during initialization routines.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.
- **CVE-2008-2934:** Free of an uninitialized pointer leads to crash and possible code execution.



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
