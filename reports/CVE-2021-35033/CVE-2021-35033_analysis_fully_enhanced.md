| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE reference clearly indicate that the root cause is the presence of a **hard-coded default password** in the firmware. This allows an attacker to gain root access, either through physical access via the UART port or remotely if the remote assistance feature is enabled. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) directly addresses this weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states: "The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded default password present in a configuration file within the firmware (/etc/uci_defconfig/system), used for the UART port on the PCB board." This aligns precisely with CWE-798's description: "The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key."
  CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) could also be considered because the attacker bypasses normal authentication by directly accessing the device via UART.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-798 is a base-level CWE. It has variants like CWE-259 (Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), but the description does not specify if the credential is used for authentication or encryption, so CWE-798 is more appropriate. CWE-798 is related to CWE-288 since the **hardcoded password** allows bypassing the intended authentication mechanisms.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of a hard-coded password in the vulnerability description and CVE details)



## Known Examples for CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1179** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1179](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1179): Router allows remote attackers to read system logs without authentication by directly connecting to the login screen and typing certain control characters.
- **CVE-1999-1454** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1454](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1454): Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.
- **CVE-1999-1077** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1077](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1077): OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.
- **CVE-2003-0304** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0304](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0304): Direct request of installation file allows attacker to create administrator accounts.
- **CVE-2002-0870** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0870](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0870): Attackers may gain additional privileges by directly requesting the web management URL.
- **CVE-2002-0066** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0066](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0066): Bypass authentication via direct request to named pipe.
- **CVE-2003-1035** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1035](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1035): User can avoid lockouts by using an API instead of the GUI to conduct brute force password guessing.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-36308**: Networking OS10, versions prior to October 2021 with Smart Fabric Services enabled, contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access and perform actions on the affected system.
- **CVE-2021-41292**: ECOA BAS controller suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability.
