# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-14340

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was discovered in XNIO where **file descriptor leak** caused by growing amounts of NIO Selector file handles between garbage collection cycles. It may allow the attacker to cause a denial of service. It affects XNIO versions 3.6.0.Beta1 through 3.8.1.Final.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **file descriptor leak**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** XNIO
- **version:** 3.6.0.Beta1 through 3.8.1.Final

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14340:

**Root Cause:**
- File descriptor leak in XNIO due to the increasing number of NIO Selector file handles not being released between garbage collection cycles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unreleased NIO selector file handles.
- The vulnerability exists in XNIO versions 3.6.0.Beta1 through 3.8.1.Final.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (file descriptor exhaustion).
- System availability is the highest threat

**Attack Vectors:**
- The content does not specify the exact mechanism for triggering the vulnerability but implies it involves operations that cause an increase in the number of NIO selector file handles.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system in a way that causes the application to create increasing amounts of NIO selector file handles.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is not within the security support scope for several older JBoss products.
- Patches were issued in xnio versions 3.7.9.Final, xnio 3.8.2.Final, xnio 3.9.0.Final.
-  It has been addressed in various Red Hat products including:
    - Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.3
    - Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4.3
    - Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes
    - Red Hat Fuse 7.9
