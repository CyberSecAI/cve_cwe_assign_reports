# Analysis for CVE-2020-14340

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-773 | Missing Reference to Active File Descriptor or Handle | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-400 | Resource Consumption | 0.60 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **file descriptor leak** due to growing amounts of NIO Selector file handles between garbage collection cycles in XNIO. This directly aligns with CWE-773, Missing Reference to Active File Descriptor or Handle, which specifies that the product does not properly maintain references to a file descriptor or handle, preventing its reclamation. The impact, denial of service, is a common consequence of resource leaks.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-773 is a Variant-level CWE, which is appropriate for mapping root causes. It is a child of CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) and related to CWE-400 (Resource Consumption). While CWE-400 is a possible impact, CWE-773 more precisely describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The retriever results also show CWE-773 as the top candidate with a score of 0.6511.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* As a secondary candidate, CWE-400 (Resource Consumption) is relevant due to the denial-of-service impact. However, it's a higher-level class and less specific than CWE-773 which directly addresses the **root cause** of the file descriptor leak. CWE-400 would be the impact of the vulnerability.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-772, which in turn is a parent of CWE-773. While related, focusing on the specific file descriptor leak makes CWE-773 a more accurate primary mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-400 is discouraged.
- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.60 (CWE-400 is a secondary consideration due to the DoS impact, but not the primary root cause.)
