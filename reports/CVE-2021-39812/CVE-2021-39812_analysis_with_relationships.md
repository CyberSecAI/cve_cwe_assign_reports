|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**use after free**" condition exists. CWE-416 (Use After Free) directly addresses this weakness, where memory is reused or referenced after it has been freed. This aligns precisely with the vulnerability description and the primary **rootcause** identified. The impact is local escalation of privilege. The use of a Variant level CWE is appropriate because the description details a specific type of memory management error. The provided Retriever Results also supports CWE-416 as a strong candidate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release). It can also lead to other issues.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from vulnerability description)
