# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-41120

## Vulnerability Description
sylius/paypal-plugin is a paypal plugin for the Sylius development platform. In affected versions the **URL to the payment page done after checkout was created with autoincremented payment id (/pay-with-paypal/{id})** and therefore it was easy to predict. The problem is that the Credit card form has prefilled credit card holder field with the Customers first and last name and hence this can lead to personally identifiable information exposure. Additionally, the mentioned form did not require authentication. The problem has been patched in Sylius/PayPalPlugin 1.2.4 and 1.3.1. If users are unable to update they can override a sylius_paypal_plugin_pay_with_paypal_form route and change its URL parameters to (for example) {orderToken}/{paymentId}, then override the Sylius\PayPalPlugin\Controller\PayWithPayPalFormAction service, to operate on the payment taken from the repository by these 2 values. It would also require usage of custom repository method. Additionally, one could override the @SyliusPayPalPlugin/payWithPaypal.html.twig template, to add contingencies [SCA_ALWAYS] line in hostedFields.submit(...) function call (line 421). It would then have to be handled in the function callback.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The payment page URL was generated using an auto-incremented payment ID, making it easily accessible to unauthorized users. The URL pattern was `/pay-with-paypal/{id}`.
*   The credit card form on the payment page pre-filled the "credit card holder" field with the customer's first and last name.
*   The credit card form lacked 3D Secure authentication, or any checks on the 3D Secure authentication result.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The use of sequential, easily guessable payment IDs in the URL allows unauthorized access to payment pages.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The pre-filling of the cardholder name field exposes the customer's personal information.
*   **Missing Security Functionality:** The absence of 3D Secure authentication and related checks creates a security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized access to payment forms, allowing malicious actors to view a customer's name.
*   Potential for unauthorized charges. Attackers could try to complete the payment using a stolen credit card.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Direct access to the payment page through brute-forcing or guessing the payment ID.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to guess or brute-force the auto-incrementing payment ID.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerable URL structure.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Sylius/PayPalPlugin versions >= 1.0.0 || >= 1.1.0 || >= 1.2.0 < 1.2.3 || 1.3.0.
*   Patched versions are 1.2.4 and 1.3.1.
*   The fix included changing the route to `/pay-with-paypal/{orderToken}/{paymentId}`.
*   The fix also implemented 3D secure authentication by adding `contingencies: ['SCA_ALWAYS']` to the `hostedFields.submit()` call.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-213.
