- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** before 5.17.1
- **component:** fs/jbd2/transaction.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `jbd2_journal_wait_updates()` function of the Linux kernel's journaling block device (jbd2) subsystem. This function is called while holding the `j_state_lock`. However, if a commit is in progress, the transaction associated with `journal->j_running_transaction` might be committed and freed via `jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()` -> `jbd2_journal_free_transaction()` when the `j_state_lock` is released. This can result in a use-after-free scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The code accesses the `transaction_t` structure after it has been freed.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the `jbd2_journal_wait_updates()` function and the transaction commit process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A use-after-free can cause the system to crash.
*   **Information Disclosure:** It's possible that the freed memory contains sensitive information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, use-after-free vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the normal operation of the jbd2 journaling system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The NetApp advisory indicates that this vulnerability can be exploited with low privileges. The CVSS vector confirms that local access is required `AV:L`
*  **Specific conditions**: Triggering this vulnerability requires a specific timing of events with the jbd2 journaling system.

**Additional Notes**

*   The commit message from the Linux kernel source code provides good details on the root cause and fix for this issue.
*   The fix involves checking for `journal->j_running_transaction` every time the `j_state_lock` is released and reacquired within the loop to avoid a use-after-free issue.
*   The NetApp advisory lists several affected products including "Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere", "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)", "NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS)" and "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node" and "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Storage Node".
*   The advisory states that NetApp is aware of public discussion regarding the vulnerability.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** due to a **race condition** in `jbd2_journal_wait_updates`. The CVE description indicates the `transaction_t` structure is accessed after being freed. This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which is a Variant-level CWE, making it a precise match. Additionally, the root cause is a race condition, making CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) relevant as a contributing factor. The vulnerability occurs because `jbd2_journal_wait_updates` and `jbd2_journal_commit_transaction` access `journal->j_running_transaction` concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to the **use-after-free**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiry). CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is a class-level weakness and can lead to various other weaknesses, including CWE-416.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence of use-after-free and race condition from CVE description and analysis)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** In languages that support it, use synchronization primitives. Only wrap these around critical code to minimize the impact on performance.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use thread-safe capabilities such as the data access abstraction in Spring.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Minimize the usage of shared resources in order to remove as much complexity as possible from the control flow and to reduce the likelihood of unexpected conditions occurring.


Additionally, this will minimize the amount of synchronization necessary and may even help to reduce the likelihood of a denial of service where an attacker may be able to repeatedly trigger a critical section (CWE-400).




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
