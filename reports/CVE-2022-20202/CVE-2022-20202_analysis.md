# Analysis for CVE-2022-20202

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read, caused by a heap buffer overflow. |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | The secondary weakness is a heap-based buffer overflow, which is the root cause of the out-of-bounds read. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an "**out of bounds read** due to a **heap buffer overflow**" in `ih264_resi_trans_quant_4x4_sse42` of `ih264_resi_trans_quant_sse42.c`. This directly aligns with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which describes reading data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The "**heap buffer overflow**" indicates that the overflow occurs in the heap, which aligns with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). CWE-125 is the primary weakness, as it describes the direct consequence of the vulnerability. CWE-122 is a contributing factor, describing where the overflow occurs. MITRE mapping guidance for both CWE-125 and CWE-122 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119. Both are related because the overflow leads to the out-of-bounds read. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) CanPrecede CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of out-of-bounds read and heap buffer overflow in the vulnerability description)
