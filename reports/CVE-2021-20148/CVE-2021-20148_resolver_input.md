# Resolution Input for CVE-2021-20148

## Vulnerability Description
ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus below build 6116 stores the password policy file for each domain under the html/ web root with a predictable filename based on the domain name. When ADSSP is configured with multiple Windows domains, a user from one domain can obtain the password policy for another domain by authenticating to the service and then sending a request specifying the password policy file of the other domain.

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-219 | Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root | 0.85 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is that the application stores sensitive password policy files under the web root with insufficient access control. The vulnerability description explicitly states that "ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus below build 6116 stores the password policy file for each domain under the html/ web root with a predictable filename based on the domain name." This perfectly matches the description of CWE-219 (Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root), which is a Variant-level CWE and thus preferred. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also reinforces this by stating that the application "fails to properly restrict access to password policy information across multiple configured Windows domains" leading to **Information Disclosure**. A secondary weakness exists because a user from one domain is able to directly request the password policy file of another domain, suggesting inadequate authorization checks which aligns with CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')). Further, the fact that a user from one domain can access another domain's password policy file by modifying the request indicates a potential Authorization Bypass through a User-Controlled Key (CWE-639).

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-219 is a variant-level weakness, making it more specific than its potential parents. It doesn't have any direct relationships listed in the provided data, but its nature relates to improper file access control. CWE-425 and CWE-639 also don't have direct relationships listed, but they are both related to authorization issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details supporting CWE-219 as the primary weakness, with secondary weaknesses CWE-425 and CWE-639 possible).

## Criticism
Okay, let's review the provided CWE analysis with the full CWE specifications.

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally good and identifies the primary vulnerability well. The justifications provided for the chosen CWEs are well-reasoned and supported by the vulnerability description and CVE summary. The confidence scores are appropriate.  The inclusion of secondary CWE candidates is also valuable.

**Detailed Review:**

*   **CWE-219: Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root**

    *   **Mapping Confidence:** 0.85 (Good)
    *   **Justification:** The justification is strong and aligns perfectly with the CWE description. The core problem is storing sensitive password policy information directly under the web root without adequate access controls. The evidence provided is direct from the vulnerability description.
    *   **CWE Specification Alignment:**  The full specification of CWE-219 reinforces this choice.  The extended description, potential mitigations (avoid storing under web root, access control permissions), and observed examples all fit the vulnerability scenario.
    *   **Critique:** No issues. This is the most accurate primary CWE.

*   **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**

    *   **Mapping Confidence:** 0.70 (Reasonable)
    *   **Justification:** The analysis argues that a user from one domain can directly request the password policy file of another domain, indicating missing authorization checks. This aligns with the description of CWE-425.
    *   **CWE Specification Alignment:** The full specification of CWE-425 supports this. The extended description notes the false assumption that resources can only be reached through a given navigation path, which is relevant here.
    *   **Critique:**  While valid, CWE-425 is somewhat general.  It's a consequence of the primary issue (CWE-219) rather than a completely independent flaw. The description doesn't directly state that the expected "navigation path" is being bypassed.

*   **CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**

    *   **Mapping Confidence:** 0.60 (Acceptable, but weakest of the three)
    *   **Justification:**  The analysis suggests that modifying the request to access another domain's password policy file constitutes an authorization bypass through a user-controlled key (the domain name in the request).
    *   **CWE Specification Alignment:**  The full specification describes how attackers can modify a key value to gain access to another user's data. The examples provided in the specification also discuss IDOR vulnerabilities.
    *   **Critique:** This is the weakest fit. The "key" (domain name) is part of the request, and changing it allows access to another domain's resources. However, a better fit *might* be found among the children of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).  The key here is that the *incorrect* authorization is happening because of how the application is *designed*: the file is accessible under the webroot.

**Alternative CWE Considerations:**

*   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials** While not the best fit, the retriever results included it as a high scoring option. However, this CWE is more about storing or transmitting credentials insecurely, which isn't the primary problem here. The vulnerability is about exposing policy files rather than credentials themselves.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Confidence Levels:** The confidence levels are appropriate given the evidence and the nature of the vulnerability.

2.  **Justification Refinement (CWE-639):** For CWE-639, re-evaluate if a more specific child of CWE-863 might be a better fit. Even if you stick with CWE-639, strengthen the justification by explicitly stating that the domain name in the request acts as a "key" that is being user-controlled to access unauthorized data.

3.  **Mitigation Analysis:** While not explicitly requested, considering the mitigations suggested by each CWE would further strengthen the analysis.
    *   For **CWE-219**, the obvious mitigation is to move the password policy files outside the web root and implement proper access controls.
    *   For **CWE-425**, the mitigation is to apply stricter authorization checks to prevent direct access to the files.
    *   For **CWE-639**, the mitigation would be to ensure that the "key" (domain name) cannot be directly modified by the user to access unauthorized data, perhaps by using session-based authentication or more robust access control mechanisms.

**Revised Summary Table (with Minor Edits):**

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-219 | Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root | 0.85 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

**In conclusion, the analysis is sound and provides a good foundation for understanding and addressing this vulnerability.  The minor suggestions above would further refine the mapping and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the CWE specifications.**
