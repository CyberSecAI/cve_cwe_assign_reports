## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is that the application stores sensitive password policy files under the web root with insufficient access control. The vulnerability description explicitly states that "ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus below build 6116 stores the password policy file for each domain under the html/ web root with a predictable filename based on the domain name." This perfectly matches the description of CWE-219 (Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root), which is a Variant-level CWE and thus preferred. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also reinforces this by stating that the application "fails to properly restrict access to password policy information across multiple configured Windows domains" leading to **Information Disclosure**. A secondary weakness exists because a user from one domain is able to directly request the password policy file of another domain, suggesting inadequate authorization checks which aligns with CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')). Further, the fact that a user from one domain can access another domain's password policy file by modifying the request indicates a potential Authorization Bypass through a User-Controlled Key (CWE-639).

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-219 is a variant-level weakness, making it more specific than its potential parents. It doesn't have any direct relationships listed in the provided data, but its nature relates to improper file access control. CWE-425 and CWE-639 also don't have direct relationships listed, but they are both related to authorization issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details supporting CWE-219 as the primary weakness, with secondary weaknesses CWE-425 and CWE-639 possible).



## Known Examples for CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539): An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26679**: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as "profile pictures." The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.
- **CVE-2021-41847**: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.
- **CVE-2021-22906**: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.
- **CVE-2021-21012**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **CVE-2021-21013**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the customer API module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure and update arbitrary information on another user's account.
- **CVE-2021-21022**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the product module. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
- **CVE-2021-21255**: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- **CVE-2021-24318**: The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.
- **CVE-2021-26024**: The Favorites component before 1.0.2 for Nagios XI 5.8.0 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference: it is possible to create favorites for any other user account.
