# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-24045 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application sets session cookies without the 'Secure' attribute, leading to potential plaintext transmission. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Captures the general risk of transmitting sensitive information (session cookies) in cleartext over HTTP. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states that the application sets session cookies without applying the 'Secure' attribute, which leads to the transmission of cookies in plaintext when using HTTP. This aligns directly with CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute). The CVE reference summary reinforces this by explicitly mentioning the lack of security attributes on session cookies as the root cause. Additionally, the summary notes that the corresponding CWE is CWE-614. While CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is also relevant, CWE-614 is more specific and accurately reflects the **root cause** related to the **missing security attributes on the session cookie**. Both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary highlight this specific weakness. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-614 as the primary candidate."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-614 is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. It is related to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) as the lack of the 'Secure' attribute leads to cleartext transmission. However, CWE-614 is a more precise description of the underlying issue. There are no direct relationships specified in the retriever results, but based on the vulnerability description, CWE-614 directly causes CWE-319 to be possible. Mapping guidance for CWE-614 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)
