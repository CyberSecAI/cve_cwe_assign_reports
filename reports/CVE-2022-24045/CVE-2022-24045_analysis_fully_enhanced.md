# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-24045

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application sets session cookies without the 'Secure' attribute, leading to potential plaintext transmission. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Captures the general risk of transmitting sensitive information (session cookies) in cleartext over HTTP. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states that the application sets session cookies without applying the 'Secure' attribute, which leads to the transmission of cookies in plaintext when using HTTP. This aligns directly with CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute). The CVE reference summary reinforces this by explicitly mentioning the lack of security attributes on session cookies as the root cause. Additionally, the summary notes that the corresponding CWE is CWE-614. While CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is also relevant, CWE-614 is more specific and accurately reflects the **root cause** related to the **missing security attributes on the session cookie**. Both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary highlight this specific weakness. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-614 as the primary candidate."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-614 is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. It is related to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) as the lack of the 'Secure' attribute leads to cleartext transmission. However, CWE-614 is a more precise description of the underlying issue. There are no direct relationships specified in the retriever results, but based on the vulnerability description, CWE-614 directly causes CWE-319 to be possible. Mapping guidance for CWE-614 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)

## Known Examples for CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0462** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0462](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0462): A product does not set the Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session with the product.
- **CVE-2008-3663** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3663](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3663): A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
- **CVE-2008-3662** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3662](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3662): A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
- **CVE-2008-0128** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0128](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0128): A product does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-35236**: The Secure flag is not set in the SSL Cookie of Kiwi Syslog Server 9.7.2 and previous versions. The Secure attribute tells the browser to only send the cookie if the request is being sent over a secure channel such as HTTPS. This will help protect the cookie from being passed over unencrypted requests. If the application can be accessed over both HTTP, there is a potential for the cookie can be sent in clear text.
- **CVE-2021-29883**: IBM Standards Processing Engine (IBM Transformation Extender Advanced 9.0 and 10.0) does not set the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies. Attackers may be able to get the cookie values by sending a http:// link to a user or by planting this link in a site the user goes to. The cookie will be sent to the insecure link and the attacker can then obtain the cookie value by snooping the traffic. IBM X-Force ID: 207090.
- **CVE-2021-38977**: IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager 3.0, 3.0.1, 4.0, and 4.1 does not set the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies. Attackers may be able to get the cookie values by sending a http:// link to a user or by planting this link in a site the user goes to. The cookie will be sent to the insecure link and the attacker can then obtain the cookie value by snooping the traffic. IBM X-Force ID: 212782.
- **CVE-2021-3882**: LedgerSMB does not set the 'Secure' attribute on the session authorization cookie when the client uses HTTPS and the LedgerSMB server is behind a reverse proxy. By tricking a user to use an unencrypted connection (HTTP), an attacker may be able to obtain the authentication data by capturing network traffic. LedgerSMB 1.8 and newer switched from Basic authentication to using cookie authentication with encrypted cookies. Although an attacker can't access the information inside the cookie, nor the password of the user, possession of the cookie is enough to access the application as the user from which the cookie has been obtained. In order for the attacker to obtain the cookie, first of all the server must be configured to respond to unencrypted requests, the attacker must be suitably positioned to eavesdrop on the network traffic between the client and the server *and* the user must be tricked into using unencrypted HTTP traffic. Proper audit control and separation of duties limit Integrity impact of the attack vector. Users of LedgerSMB 1.8 are urged to upgrade to known-fixed versions. Users of LedgerSMB 1.7 or 1.9 are unaffected by this vulnerability and don't need to take action. As a workaround, users may configure their Apache or Nginx reverse proxy to add the Secure attribute at the network boundary instead of relying on LedgerSMB. For Apache, please refer to the 'Header always edit' configuration command in the mod_headers module. For Nginx, please refer to the 'proxy_cookie_flags' configuration command.
- **CVE-2021-29248**: BTCPay Server through 1.0.7.0 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by failure to set the Secure flag for a cookie.
- **CVE-2022-24045**: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo DXR2 (All versions < V01.21.142.5-22), Desigo PXC3 (All versions < V01.21.142.4-18), Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The application, after a successful login, sets the session cookie on the browser via client-side JavaScript code, without applying any security attributes (such as “Secure”, “HttpOnly”, or “SameSite”). Any attempts to browse the application via unencrypted HTTP protocol would lead to the transmission of all his/her session cookies in plaintext through the network. An attacker could then be able to sniff the network and capture sensitive information.
