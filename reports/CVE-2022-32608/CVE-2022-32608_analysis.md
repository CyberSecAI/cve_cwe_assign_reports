## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **use after free** due to a **race condition**. The CVE reference summary confirms a **TOCTOU race condition** leading to a **use-after-free**. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.

CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) describes the **race condition** aspect. CWE-416 is the primary weakness because the vulnerability's immediate result is the **use after free**. CWE-367 is related as the root cause enabling the **use after free**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on ресурсе after Expiry). CWE-367 does not have any direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the clear description of the vulnerability and confirmation in the CVE reference summary)
