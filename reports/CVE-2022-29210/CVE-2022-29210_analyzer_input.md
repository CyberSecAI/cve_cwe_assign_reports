# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-29210

## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a **very poor hash function for constants** (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **very poor hash function for constants**
- **impact:** ASAN failures
- **vector:** access individual tensor bytes
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **version:** 2.8.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29210:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect hash function used for `TensorKey` objects in TensorFlow. The original hash function used an estimated `AllocatedBytes()` value, which is not suitable for hashing tensor contents, and tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` using the allocated bytes size, which can be inaccurate and lead to out of bounds access. Also, it did not consider the actual values of the data in the tensor, such as the string values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Hash Function:** The hash function was based on an estimate of allocated memory rather than the actual content of the tensor.
- **Out-of-bounds Access:** The hash function attempted to access tensor bytes using `AllocatedBytes()`, which could be inaccurate, leading to out-of-bounds memory access when trying to read tensor data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:** The incorrect hash function and out-of-bounds access can lead to a heap buffer overflow, which can result in crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **ASAN Failures:** The issues can lead to AddressSanitizer (ASAN) failures, which are indicative of memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing specially crafted tensors that would result in the problematic hash function to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger the use of the flawed `TensorKey` hash function, likely by using it in operations involving tensors.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in TensorFlow version 2.8.0.
- Patches were applied in versions 2.8.1 and 2.9.0.
- The fix involved modifying the hash function to more accurately reflect the `==` operator, correctly handling string types and numeric types.
