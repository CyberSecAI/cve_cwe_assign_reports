# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-41017

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 1.00 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.60 | Base | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.50 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that there are multiple **heap-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities in some web API controllers of FortiWeb. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the root cause is a **heap-based buffer overflow**, which is represented by CWE-122. CWE-122 is a Variant-level CWE, making it a specific and appropriate choice. The description also indicates specifically crafted HTTP requests, implying potential issues with input validation and handling, which could lead to the overflow. CWE-120 is considered because of the potential for a buffer copy operation without checking the size of the input, leading to the overflow. CWE-1284 is also considered because the crafted HTTP requests could involve quantities (e.g., size, length) that are not properly validated, which could contribute to the overflow.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of a buffer overflow, and it is directly related to the vulnerability described. CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) can be a related weakness, especially if the **heap-based buffer overflow** involves copying data into a heap-allocated buffer without proper size validation. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is related in the sense that the size of input or other quantity related to the HTTP request might not be properly validated.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.00 (High confidence due to direct evidence of **heap-based buffer overflow** from the description and CVE reference summary).

## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
- **CVE-2020-21602**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
