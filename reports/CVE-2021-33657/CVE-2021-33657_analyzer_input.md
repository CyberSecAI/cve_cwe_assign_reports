# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-33657

## Vulnerability Description
There is a **heap overflow** problem in video/SDL_pixels.c in SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) 2.x to 2.0.18 versions. By crafting a malicious .BMP file, an attacker can cause the application using this library to crash, denial of service or Code execution.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **impact:** crash and denial of service and code execution
- **vector:** crafting a malicious .BMP file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
- **version:** 2.x to 2.0.18
- **component:** video/SDL_pixels.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33657:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in how SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) handles color mapping, specifically within the `Map1to1` and `Map1toN` functions in `SDL_pixels.c`.  The code was not always allocating a full 256-entry map for color palettes, which can lead to out-of-bounds access when color values exceed the allocated range.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** When a color index is outside the bounds of the allocated map, the program will write to an invalid memory location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** As stated in the security advisories, the worst-case impact could be arbitrary code execution. Although not explicitly stated, an out-of-bounds write could be leveraged to corrupt memory and potentially redirect program flow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing crafted or malformed images or sound files that have color palettes with out-of-range color indices. When these files are processed by SDL, the vulnerability will be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide SDL with malicious images or sound files. This implies that the attacker would need to control an input that the application using SDL will process. This could be a malicious file loaded from disk, or possibly through network interaction, if the application also uses SDL for network resources.

**Additional Details:**
- The GitHub commit message mentions "Always create a full 256-entry map in case color values are out of range," indicating a fix by always allocating the full size, thus preventing out of bounds access.
- The Gentoo security advisories (GLSA 202305-17 and GLSA 202305-18) list CVE-2021-33657 as one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting libsdl and libsdl2, respectively. Both advisories indicate that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The Debian security advisory (DLA 3314-1) also includes CVE-2021-33657 as part of a broader set of vulnerabilities in libsdl2.
- The comments in the GitHub commit confirm that this change is linked to CVE-2021-33657.
