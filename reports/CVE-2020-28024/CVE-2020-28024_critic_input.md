# Critic Input for CVE-2020-28024



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Buffer Underwrite that may result in unauthenticated remote attackers executing arbitrary commands, because smtp_ungetc was only intended to push back characters, but can actually push back non-character error codes such as EOF.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer underwrite**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary commands
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attackers
- **product:** Exim
- **version:** 4 before 4.94.2
- **component:** smtp_ungetc

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28024.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `smtp_ungetc()` function in Exim. This function is used to push characters back into the `smtp_inbuffer` after they have been read by `smtp_getc()`. Specifically, `smtp_ungetc()` doesn't properly handle cases where it's asked to push back characters that weren't originally read from the buffer, such as EOF or special control characters for BDAT.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Buffer Underflow:** The core vulnerability is a heap buffer underflow within the `smtp_ungetc()` function. The code decrements the `smtp_inptr` without checking if it goes below the beginning of `smtp_inbuffer`, causing an out-of-bounds write when pushing a character back to the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Remote Code Execution:** While the provided text doesn't explicitly confirm successful RCE, the heap underflow could potentially be used as a building block for a more complex exploit that leads to arbitrary code execution, especially given other vulnerabilities within the same code base.
- **Crash/Denial of Service:** At a minimum, exploitation of this underflow will cause a crash of the Exim process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network, targeting the Exim server.
- **TLS Connection Required:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a TLS-encrypted connection is used and terminated in a specific sequence. This can be achieved through TLS-on-connect or STARTTLS with X_PIPE_CONNECT enabled.
- **Specific Character Sequence:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a bare `\r` character, followed by a TLS connection termination.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Exim server over the network.
- **TLS Support:** The attacker must be able to establish a TLS encrypted connection.
- **Specific Sequence:** The attacker must send a bare '\r' character and then terminate the TLS connection.
- **Exim Configuration:** The vulnerability requires either TLS-on-connect or STARTTLS with X_PIPE_CONNECT enabled (default since Exim 4.94).

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary clearly state that the root cause is a **buffer underwrite** within the `smtp_ungetc()` function. The code decrements the `smtp_inptr` without proper bounds checking, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This perfectly aligns with CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')). The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-124 with a high score, and its usage is ALLOWED. Other suggestions such as integer overflows are less relevant because the core issue is writing before the beginning of the allocated buffer due to an incorrect pointer.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships are explicitly mentioned in the provided information; however, CWE-124 can be related to other memory safety issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.

### Alternative Terms
buffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer underrun". "Buffer underflow" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-786
ChildOf -> CWE-787
CanFollow -> CWE-839

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Choose a language that is not susceptible to these issues.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** All calculated values that are used as index or for pointer arithmetic should be validated to ensure that they are within an expected range.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image
- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.
- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)
