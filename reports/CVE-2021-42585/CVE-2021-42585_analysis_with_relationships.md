|---------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow  | 0.95       | Variant               | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                       |
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.60       | Base                 | Allowed                         | Secondary Candidate               |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap buffer overflow**" in `copy_compressed_bytes`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating "The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, where the `memcpy` function writes data past the allocated buffer." This aligns directly with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), a Variant of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap portion of memory. The description mentions an incorrect calculation of buffer size which may have lead to the overflow. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-122 indicates this is ALLOWED for heap overflow vulnerabilities.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It's also related to memory management and allocation issues. The incorrect buffer size calculation could potentially be linked to CWE-131, or an integer overflow (CWE-190) during the size calculation, making these secondary considerations.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

- **Analysis and Justification for Secondary Candidates:**
  - *Explanation:* The root cause description states, "The overflow occurs due to an incorrect calculation of buffer size when decompressing data." This incorrect calculation could be due to an integer overflow, which aligns with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). If the size calculation wraps around, it could lead to a smaller-than-expected buffer allocation, resulting in a heap overflow when more data is written than allocated. While not explicitly stated, it's a plausible contributing factor.
  - Confidence: 0.60

- *Explanation:* The description also indicates the possibility of CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) since the buffer size was incorrectly calculated. CWE-131 can lead to buffer overflows.
  - Confidence: 0.50
