# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-39671

## Vulnerability Description
In code generated by aidl_const_expressions.cpp, there is a possible out of bounds read due to **uninitialized data**. This could lead to information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-12Android ID A-206718630

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized data**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **vector:** out of bounds read
- **product:** Android
- **version:** Android-12
- **component:** code generated by aidl_const_expressions.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is related to the automatic initialization of char-type fields in the Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL). Specifically, when a char-type field was not explicitly specified, it was automatically initialized with '\\0'.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from the way AIDL handles char-type fields. Automatically initializing them with '\\0' when not explicitly specified can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The provided content indicates that the vulnerability could lead to Elevation of Privilege (EoP).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves exploiting the automatic default value assignment for char-type fields during AIDL operations.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with or influence AIDL processes."
