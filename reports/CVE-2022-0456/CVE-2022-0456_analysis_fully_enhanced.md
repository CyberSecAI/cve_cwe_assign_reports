|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "Use after free" in "Web Search in Google Chrome prior to 98.0.4758.80 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via **profile destruction**." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause as "Use after free" and identifies "Use after free" as a weakness. This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes the product reusing or referencing memory after it has been freed. The description and summary provide strong evidence supporting this classification. The retriever results also ranked CWE-416 as the top candidate.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a Variant-level CWE, offering a specific description of the weakness. While other CWEs like CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through Its Lifetime) might be relevant, CWE-416 provides the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "Use after free" in both the vulnerability description and CVE reference).



## Known Examples for CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-1000613** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1000613](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1000613): Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2022-22249**: An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When there is a continuous mac move a memory corruption causes one or more FPCs to crash and reboot. These MAC moves can be between two local interfaces or between core/EVPN and local interface. The below error logs can be seen in PFE syslog when this issue happens: xss_event_handler(1071): EA[0:0]_PPE 46.xss[0] ADDR Error. ppe_error_interrupt(4298): EA[0:0]_PPE 46 Errors sync xtxn error xss_event_handler(1071): EA[0:0]_PPE 1.xss[0] ADDR Error. ppe_error_interrupt(4298): EA[0:0]_PPE 1 Errors sync xtxn error xss_event_handler(1071): EA[0:0]_PPE 2.xss[0] ADDR Error. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series: All versions prior to 15.1R7-S13; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S9; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S7, 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2.
- **CVE-2022-22250**: An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In an EVPN-MPLS scenario, if MAC is learned locally on an access interface but later a request to delete is received indicating that the MAC was learnt remotely, this can lead to memory corruption which can result in line card crash and reload. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions 17.3R1 and later versions prior to 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S3-EVO; 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R1-S1-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 17.3R1.
