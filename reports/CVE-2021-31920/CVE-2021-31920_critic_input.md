# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Istio before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5 has a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request path with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters (%2F or %5C) could potentially bypass an Istio authorization policy when path based authorization rules are used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper URL encoding handling**
- **impact:** bypass Istio authorization policy
- **vector:** HTTP request path with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters
- **product:** Istio
- **version:** before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** HTTP request paths with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters (`%2F` or `%5C`) are not normalized consistently by Istio's authorization policies and backend services.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent path normalization between Istio's authorization policies and backend services allows for authorization bypass. Specifically, authorization policies that use `ALLOW action + notPaths field` or `DENY action + paths field` are vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass path-based authorization policies, gaining access to resources that should be restricted. For example, a request to `//admin` can bypass a policy that denies access to `/admin`. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the backend service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending HTTP requests with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters in the URL path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Istio service mesh with manipulated URL paths, with knowledge of the authorization policies in place.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that **improper URL encoding handling** can lead to a bypass of Istio authorization policies. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when HTTP requests with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters bypass path-based authorization rules. This aligns with CWE-50, "Path Equivalence: '//multiple/leading/slash'," as it describes how multiple leading slashes can lead to ambiguous path resolution. The vulnerability summary also specifies the usage of escaped slash characters which also means that CWE-177 could be a contributing factor. CWE-41 is also potentially applicable as it describes file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. However, the primary issue is the mishandling of multiple slashes which is exactly what CWE-50 describes. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a broader class, but the specific cause (path equivalence) makes CWE-50 more appropriate as the primary weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-50 as it is a variant.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-50 and CWE-41 are related since they both address Path Equivalence issues. CWE-50 is a specific case of CWE-41, according to the CWE definition itself (CWE-41's Description explicitly includes CWE-50 as one of its children/variants). CWE-863 is a Class that is higher level than CWE-50 and CWE-41 which are Base/Variant.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

### Extended Description
Path equivalence is usually employed in order to circumvent access controls expressed using an incomplete set of file name or file path representations. This is different from path traversal, wherein the manipulations are performed to generate a name for a different object.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Output Encoding
- **Description:** Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Some of these manipulations could be effective in path traversal issues, too.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the product into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. Use role-based access control (RBAC) [REF-229] to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.


Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that access control checks are performed related to the business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that are applied to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor [REF-7].

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].




### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
