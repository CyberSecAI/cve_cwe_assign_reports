## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack overflow**" in the `lang` parameter of the `setLanguageCfg` function. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability, where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. The description provides a clear indication of the weakness, making CWE-121 the most appropriate choice. Other CWEs like CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) or CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) are less specific, as the description already indicates that the overflow is stack-based, not heap-based and not necessarily due to unchecked size. The Usage for CWE-121 is Allowed.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of buffer overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (Direct evidence from vulnerability description)
