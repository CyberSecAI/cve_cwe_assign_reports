# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-42739

## Vulnerability Description
The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a **buffer overflow** related to drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt **mishandles bounds checking**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **mishandles bounds checking**
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** through 5.14.13
- **component:** firewire subsystem, drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking in the `avc_ca_pmt` function of the `firedtv` driver. Specifically, the function does not adequately validate the size of the input data, leading to a heap buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow. The `avc_ca_pmt` function reads data from a user-supplied buffer into a kernel buffer (`c->operand`), but doesn't properly validate the read positions, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer boundaries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to system crash, or escalate privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local user can trigger the vulnerability via a crafted ioctl call (`CA_SEND_MSG`) to the `firedtv` driver. This driver manages FireDTV media cards on the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to make ioctl calls to the device driver. No special privileges are needed to trigger the bug, but escalating privileges is part of the vulnerability's impact."
