# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-31747

## Vulnerability Description
Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Nicolas B. Pierron, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported **memory safety bugs** present in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory safety bugs**
- **impact:** run arbitrary code
- **product:** Thunderbird and Firefox and Firefox ESR
- **version:** < 91.10 and < 101 and < 91.10

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31747:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2022-31747 is a set of memory safety bugs discovered in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9. These bugs were identified through reports from Mozilla developers (Andrew McCreight, Nicolas B. Pierron) and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Memory safety bugs leading to memory corruption.
  Specifically, the following bugs are included:
  - Bug 1765610: "Compromised content process can generate gamepad events via PGamepadTestChannelChild::SendGamepadTestEvent"
  - Bug 1766283: "InlineTable does not provide any deterministic order (HashTable previous resize change the ordering of entries)"
  - Bug 1768734: "use-after-poison in [@ JS::HeapValuePostWriteBarrier]"
  - Bug 1760765: "Intermittent SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /builds/worker/workspace/obj-build/dist/include/mozilla/RefPtr.h:50 in mozilla::RefPtrTraits<mozilla::media::OriginKeyStore>::Release"
  - Bug 1768559: "AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow in [@ mozilla::SipccSdp::GetMediaSection]"
  - Bug 1767365: "crash in [@ mozilla::gfx::Premultiply_SSE2]"

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Arbitrary code execution:  The description explicitly mentions that some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and could potentially be exploited to run arbitrary code.
- Memory corruption: The identified vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption.
- Crashes: Several bugs reported crashes related to memory issues such as heap-use-after-free, heap-buffer-overflow, use-after-poison, crashes in specific functions.
- In the case of Bug 1765610, a compromised content process can generate gamepad events, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially be used as part of a larger exploit.
- In the case of Bug 1766283, the non-deterministic ordering of InlineTable entries could lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious web pages: These vulnerabilities are triggered through the processing of web content, making malicious web pages the primary attack vector.
-  Compromised content process: In Bug 1765610, if a content process is compromised, it can then trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to serve malicious web content: An attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious code into web pages visited by the victim.
- In the case of Bug 1765610, an attacker needs to be able to compromise a content process.

**Additional Notes:**

- This CVE covers multiple memory safety issues, not just one specific bug.
- The bugs were present in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9 and were fixed in Firefox 101 and Firefox ESR 91.10.
- The severity is rated as high due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
