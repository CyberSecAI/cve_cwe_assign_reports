# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41858

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A **NULL pointer dereference** may occur while a slip driver is in progress to detach in sl_tx_timeout in drivers/net/slip/slip.c. This issue could allow an attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **NULL pointer dereference**
- **impact:** crash the system or leak internal kernel information
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** drivers/net/slip/slip.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `sl_tx_timeout()` function within the Linux Kernel's Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) driver.
- When a SLIP driver is being detached (`slip_close()`), it sets `sl->tty` to NULL after acquiring a lock. However, the `sl_tx_timeout()` function, which can be called concurrently, does not check if `sl->tty` is NULL before dereferencing it. This can cause a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that `sl_tx_timeout()` accesses `sl->tty` without verifying if it's a valid pointer, which leads to dereferencing a NULL pointer when the device is being closed.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between `slip_close()` and `sl_tx_timeout()`. Although locks are used, there is no check in `sl_tx_timeout()` to verify that `sl->tty` is still valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A null pointer dereference will lead to a crash of the kernel, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly stated in the patch description, the NetApp advisory notes that sensitive information could potentially be disclosed due to the underlying kernel vulnerability. This might involve leaking memory or other kernel data structures when the driver crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered within the kernel's SLIP driver. Thus, local access is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to interact with a SLIP device:** The attacker must be able to interact with a system using the SLIP protocol. The attacker must also be able to initiate a detach procedure while a packet is being transmitted to the driver, triggering the race condition.
- **Low Privileges:** Based on the CVSS vector, the attacker needs low privileges to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves adding a check in `sl_tx_timeout()` to verify if `sl->tty` is NULL. If `sl->tty` is NULL, the function exits without dereferencing the null pointer.
- NetApp identifies multiple affected products, specifically NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC).
- NetApp states that there are currently no plans to patch the vulnerability in the affected products and directs users to an end of availability (EOA) announcement.
