# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-1351

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | The primary weakness is XSS due to insufficient input validation. |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The **insufficient input validation** may lead to improper encoding of the output. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the vulnerability is a **cross-site scripting (XSS)** due to **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** by the web-based interface. This directly aligns with CWE-79, which describes "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')". The provided documents in "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirm that the root cause is **insufficient validation of user-supplied input**, the weakness is XSS, and the impact includes executing arbitrary script code and accessing sensitive browser information. The attacker can exploit this by persuading a user to click a maliciously crafted link. The usage for CWE-79 is "Allowed", indicating it is appropriate. While CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)) is a more specific variant of XSS, there isn't enough information to determine if the XSS is specifically related to HTML tags, so CWE-79 is more appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-79 is a Base level CWE. It is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements), but CWE-79 is more specific to XSS. CWE-79 can precede CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, and alignment with MITRE mapping guidance).

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1351**: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface of the affected service. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **CVE-2021-29467**: Wrongthink is an encrypted peer-to-peer chat program. A user could check their fingerprint into the service and enter a script to run arbitrary JavaScript on the site. No workarounds exist, but a patch exists in version 2.4.1.
- **CVE-2021-29503**: HedgeDoc is a platform to write and share markdown. HedgeDoc before version 1.8.2 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack using the YAML-metadata of a note. An attacker with write access to a note can embed HTML tags in the Open Graph metadata section of the note, resulting in the frontend rendering the script tag as part of the `<head>` section. Unless your instance prevents guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to inject JavaScript into notes that allow guest edits. If your instance prevents guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to inject JavaScript into any note pages they have write-access to. This vulnerability is patched in version 1.8.2. As a workaround, one can disable guest edits until the next update.
- **CVE-2021-43441**: An HTML Injection Vulnerability in iOrder 1.0 allows the remote attacker to execute Malicious HTML codes via the signup form
- **CVE-2022-21145**: A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the WebUserActions.aspx functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 9.1.20.2. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary Javascript code injection. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2022-28703**: A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the HdConfigActions.aspx altertextlanguages functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary Javascript code injection. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.
