# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-31748

## Vulnerability Description
Mozilla developers Gabriele Svelto, Timothy Nikkel, Randell Jesup, Jon Coppeard, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported **memory safety bugs** present in Firefox 100. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 101.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory safety bugs**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **product:** Firefox
- **version:** < 101

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2022-31748.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple memory safety bugs were identified in Firefox 100. These bugs could lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Memory safety bugs, including heap-buffer-overflow, use-after-free, data races, and crashes due to incorrect memory access or handling, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The identified memory corruption issues could, with enough effort, be exploited to run arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
The specific attack vectors for each individual bug are not provided, but they involve general browser functionality potentially triggered via crafted web content. The generic term "memory safety bugs" does not indicate a specific exploit vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to deliver malicious content that triggers the memory safety bugs in Firefox 100. This could be achieved through malicious websites or other means of delivering such content.
