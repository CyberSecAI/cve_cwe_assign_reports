# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
fr-archive-libarchive.c in GNOME file-roller through 3.38.0, as used by GNOME Shell and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a files parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **improper symlink checking**
- **impact:** directory traversal
- **product:** GNOME file-roller
- **version:** through 3.38.0
- **component:** fr-archive-libarchive.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks within the GNOME Archive Manager (file-roller) when extracting archive files, specifically when dealing with symlinks within the parent directories of extracted files. The vulnerability is present in the `libarchive` library used by file-roller, where symlinks in the parent directories of files being extracted were not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability. By crafting a malicious archive containing symlinks in the parent directories, an attacker can force the Archive Manager to write files to locations outside of the intended extraction directory.
- **Insufficient Symlink Handling:** The application's logic failed to correctly identify and prevent the traversal through symlinks present in the parent directories of the extracted files. This allowed for bypassing previous checks that aimed to prevent files from being extracted outside the destination directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the user's system. This could lead to:
    - **System Compromise:** Overwriting critical system files, potentially leading to denial of service or complete system compromise.
    - **Data Tampering:** Overwriting user data files, causing data loss or corruption.
    - **Malware Installation:** Overwriting executable files with malicious code, leading to malware infection.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Archive:** The primary attack vector involves a crafted archive file (e.g., a .tar file). This archive would contain specially crafted directory structures with symlinks designed to cause the Archive Manager to write files to unintended locations.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious archive using the vulnerable version of GNOME Archive Manager to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Archive Creation:** An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious archive file with the specific structure to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Distribution:** The attacker must find a way to distribute the malicious archive and convince a user to open it using the vulnerable Archive Manager. This could be achieved via phishing emails, malicious websites, or other methods of social engineering.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept archive (`dirsymlink2a.tar`) and a video demonstrating the exploit.
- A patch was implemented by disallowing symlinks in parent directories, effectively preventing the directory traversal attack.
- Fedora's security update indicates that the vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-36314.
- The vulnerability was addressed in `file-roller-3.38.0-3.fc34` for Fedora 34.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that GNOME file-roller is susceptible to directory traversal due to **improper symlink checking** during extraction. The CVE reference summary supports this by stating that the "**Root Cause of Vulnerability**" is insufficient checks when dealing with symlinks in parent directories. This aligns directly with CWE-59 [Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')], which describes a weakness where the product doesn't properly prevent a filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource. Given that the vulnerability is triggered by a crafted archive with symlinks in parent directories, CWE-59 is the most appropriate primary mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-59 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-59 [Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')] is related to CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')], as the **improper handling of symlinks** leads to the ability to traverse directories outside of the intended extraction path. The Retriever results confirm this relationship, with CWE-22 being the second highest scoring CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence of **improper symlink handling** leading to directory traversal and high retriever scores for CWE-59 and CWE-22.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single "." character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as "/" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.


Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering "/" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of "\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if "../" sequences are removed from the ".../...//" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of "../" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the "../" string.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.


Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes ".." sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). This includes:


  - realpath() in C

  - getCanonicalPath() in Java

  - GetFullPath() in ASP.NET

  - realpath() or abs_path() in Perl

  - realpath() in PHP





### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

**Reasons:**

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.


Denying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file. Ensure good compartmentalization in the system to provide protected areas that can be trusted.




### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.
