# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-36314 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that GNOME file-roller is susceptible to directory traversal due to **improper symlink checking** during extraction. The CVE reference summary supports this by stating that the "**Root Cause of Vulnerability**" is insufficient checks when dealing with symlinks in parent directories. This aligns directly with CWE-59 [Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')], which describes a weakness where the product doesn't properly prevent a filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource. Given that the vulnerability is triggered by a crafted archive with symlinks in parent directories, CWE-59 is the most appropriate primary mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-59 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-59 [Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')] is related to CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')], as the **improper handling of symlinks** leads to the ability to traverse directories outside of the intended extraction path. The Retriever results confirm this relationship, with CWE-22 being the second highest scoring CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence of **improper symlink handling** leading to directory traversal and high retriever scores for CWE-59 and CWE-22.)
