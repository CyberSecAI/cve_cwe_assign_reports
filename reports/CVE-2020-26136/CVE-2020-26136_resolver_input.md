# Resolution Input for CVE-2020-26136

## Vulnerability Description
In SilverStripe through 4.6.0-rc1, GraphQL doesnt honour MFA (multi-factor authentication) when using basic authentication.

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-308 | Use of Single-factor Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability explicitly states that MFA is bypassed due to the acceptance of basic authentication, directly aligning with the use of single-factor authentication. |
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The GraphQL module provides an alternate path (basic authentication) that bypasses the intended MFA, fitting the description of authentication bypass via an alternate channel. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The GraphQL endpoint is missing proper authentication mechanisms that would prevent bypassing MFA. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the fact that the GraphQL module in Silverstripe allows basic authentication which bypasses MFA. This directly corresponds to **CWE-308 (Use of Single-factor Authentication)**, as basic authentication serves as a single factor, negating the intended multi-factor security. The CVE description mentions that the GraphQL module accepts basic authentication by default, leading to the **MFA bypass**. The root cause is the **lack of enforcement of MFA** when basic authentication is used. CWE-308 is a Base level CWE and the mapping guidance indicates it is ALLOWED. This mapping is very precise, as it focuses on the specific authentication failure.
  CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is also relevant as the GraphQL module offers an alternate authentication path (basic authentication) that circumvents MFA.
  CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a secondary candidate, because the GraphQL endpoint is not properly secured to enforce MFA when basic authentication is used.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-308 does not have direct relationships to the other potential CWEs. CWE-288 does not have any relationships. CWE-306 is a peer of CWE-288, however no relationship exists between CWE-306 and CWE-308.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of MFA bypass via basic authentication and clear root cause description)

## Criticism
Okay, I've reviewed the provided analysis against the full CWE specifications. Here's my critique:

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally good and identifies the core issue well. The primary CWE assignment of **CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication** is accurate and well-justified. The selection of **CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel** as a secondary candidate is also reasonable. However, the inclusion of **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function** is less appropriate, and some adjustments to the confidence scores and justifications are warranted.

**Detailed Critique:**

*   **CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication**

    *   **Assessment:** Excellent choice as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that MFA is bypassed due to the acceptance of basic authentication.  Basic authentication, when used alone, *is* single-factor authentication.
    *   **Confidence:**  The confidence score of 0.9 is appropriate.
    *   **Justification:** The justification is well-written and accurately reflects the relationship between the vulnerability and the CWE definition. It correctly points out the explicit mention of MFA bypass and the lack of MFA enforcement.
    *   **Mapping Guidance Compliance:** Complies with the "Allowed" usage for a Base-level CWE.
    *   **Potential Mitigations:** Mitigation 1 for CWE-308 ("Use multiple independent authentication schemes") directly addresses the vulnerability. The fix of removing basic authentication by default aligns with this mitigation, as it forces the use of MFA (or other stronger authentication) to be explicitly configured.

*   **CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel**

    *   **Assessment:** A good secondary candidate, but not as precise as CWE-308. The GraphQL module's basic authentication *does* provide an alternate path that bypasses the intended MFA. The *existence* of an alternate path bypasses the *requirement* for MFA.
    *   **Confidence:** A confidence score of 0.7 is appropriate.
    *   **Justification:** The justification is correct.
    *   **Mapping Guidance Compliance:** Complies with the "Allowed" usage for a Base-level CWE.
    *   **Potential Mitigations:** Mitigation 1 for CWE-288 ("Funnel all access through a single choke point...") applies. By removing the default for basic authentication, the vulnerability was remediated by the system only allowing authenticated access through MFA.

*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**

    *   **Assessment:** The weakest choice and should be removed. While *technically* correct in that the GraphQL endpoint with basic authentication *doesn't enforce MFA*, the core issue is that it's *accepting* a weaker form of authentication instead of *requiring* the stronger one. In other words, it is not that there is *no* authentication, but that there is *insufficient* authentication.
    *   **Confidence:** The confidence score should be very low, or the CWE should be removed.
    *   **Justification:** The justification is too broad. The endpoint *does* have authentication (basic auth), just not the *right* kind (MFA).
    *   **Mapping Guidance Compliance:** Complies with the "Allowed" usage for a Base-level CWE, but the fit is poor.
    *   **Potential Mitigations:** Mitigation 1 for CWE-306 ("Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas...") is too general for this specific vulnerability.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Remove CWE-306.** The vulnerability isn't a *lack* of authentication; it's the *presence* of weak authentication bypassing stronger authentication.
2.  **Refine Justifications:** Focus the justifications on the specific aspects of the vulnerability that align with the CWE descriptions.
3.  **Double-check Retriever Results:** Review the retriever results. While the current selections seem reasonable, the other CWEs listed might offer insights or alternative perspectives, especially given the nuances of authentication vulnerabilities. For example, CWE-1390: Weak Authentication.
