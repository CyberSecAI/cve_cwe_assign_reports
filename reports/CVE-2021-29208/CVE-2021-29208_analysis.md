# Analysis for CVE-2021-29208

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') | 0.85 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**dom xss**" which strongly indicates CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). The vulnerability occurs because the product does not properly neutralize user-controllable input before placing it in the output used as a web page, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. This aligns directly with the CWE-79 description and its intended usage. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-79 as the top match with a high combined score.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a parent of CWE-79, the specific mention of "dom xss" makes CWE-79 a more precise and appropriate mapping. CWE-79 can also lead to other vulnerabilities like CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')), because successful XSS attacks can allow the attacker to modify HTTP Headers.

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions "**crlf injection**" which strongly indicates CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')). The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers, thus aligning to CWE-113.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-113 is a variant and therefore a more specific version of the more general CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "dom xss" and a high retriever score for CWE-79)
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "crlf injection" and the proper conditions for CWE-113)
