# Analysis for CVE-2021-21253

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-759 | Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE: The application **hashes user passwords without a salt**, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks. |
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: Using a one-way hash without a salt indicates insufficient computational effort to protect passwords. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the OnlineVotingSystem **hashes user passwords without a salt**. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-759, "Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt," which is a Variant level weakness and is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly identifies this as the root cause and refers to CWE-759. The absence of a salt makes the system vulnerable to dictionary attacks, increasing the risk of password compromise. While other CWEs like CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) are relevant, CWE-759 is more specific to the described **weakness**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-759 is a child of CWE-916. CWE-916 is a more general case of using weak password hashing, while CWE-759 specifies the use of one-way hashing without a salt. Mapping to CWE-759 is more specific and appropriate given the description.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, as well as the Retriever Results)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is a candidate because the use of a one-way hash function without a salt indicates insufficient computational effort to protect passwords. The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive. It's a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED. While not as specific as CWE-759, it is still relevant as a broader characterization of the **weakness**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-916 is a parent of CWE-759, meaning that CWE-759 is a more specific type of insufficient computational effort.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Medium confidence because, although relevant, it's less specific than CWE-759)
