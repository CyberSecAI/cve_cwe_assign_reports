# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41009

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the port triger protocol (tcp|udp|tcp/udp) triger port forward port description WORD command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence, and it includes information about CVE-2022-41009.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `sprintf` with unchecked input sizes when parsing commands in the `DetranCLI` binary. The `sprintf` function copies data into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying if the provided input data exceeds the buffer's capacity, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The specific weakness is a classic stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120). The `DetranCLI` binary uses a pattern of `sprintf(stack_buffer, format_string, command_parameter_1, ...)` where the size of `command_parameter_X` is not checked against the `stack_buffer`'s size. This occurs in various commands, each parsing parameters using a defined template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution. The attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and redirect execution to attacker-controlled code, allowing them to gain control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is sending specially crafted network packets to the device that contain commands with oversized parameters for the vulnerable commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must have network access to the device and be able to send commands to the `DetranCLI` interface. Based on the CVSS score, the attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) to exploit the vulnerability.
Specifically for CVE-2022-41009:

The vulnerability is in the `port triger protocol` command, with the following template:
```
port triger protocol (tcp|udp|tcp/udp) triger port <1-65535> forward port <1-65535> description WORD
```
The vulnerable code is:
```
sprintf(buff_0x80,"%d<%d<%s<%s<%s>",1,based_on_argv[0],atoi_argv[1],atoi_argv[2],argv[3]);
```
An attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow by providing a long string in `argv[3]`.
