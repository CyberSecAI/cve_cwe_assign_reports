## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2021-28918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `netmask` npm package incorrectly parses IPv4 addresses that contain leading zeros. It treats octal representations (numbers prefixed with "0") as decimal numbers, stripping the leading zeros, rather than interpreting them as octal values. This behavior deviates from how other systems, like web browsers, interpret such mixed-format IP addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation and handling of octal strings within IPv4 address inputs.
*   **Incorrect IP Parsing:** The library fails to correctly interpret octal representations of IPv4 addresses leading to misinterpretations of the actual IP address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSRF Bypass:** Attackers can bypass Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) protections by crafting IP addresses with leading zeros. For example, `0177.0.0.1` (octal for 127.0.0.1) could be used to access the local loopback address even if the application filters for private IP addresses.
*   **RFI/LFI:** By manipulating the octets of IP addresses with leading zeros, attackers can cause the application to treat public IPs as private IPs or vice-versa. This can lead to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) or Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.
*   **ACL Bypass:** IP-based Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be bypassed, as `netmask` would interpret the crafted IP addresses differently than the systems it is intended to protect. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and networks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Requests:** Attacker influences the IP address input that is parsed by the application.
*   **Webhooks:** Systems that expose webhooks and validate user URLs using `netmask` are vulnerable.
*   **IP Filtering:** Systems using netmask for IP filtering (e.g. WAFs) can be bypassed by providing crafted IP addresses with leading zeros.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Influence IP Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the input to a system or application that parses IP addresses using the vulnerable `netmask` library.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers in many cases.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was initially addressed in `netmask` version 2.0.0 but was found to be incomplete. The issue was assigned a new CVE (CVE-2021-29418). A complete fix was released in version 2.0.1.
*   The Perl component `Net::Netmask` also had the same vulnerability.
*   The `private-ip` package, which uses `netmask` as a dependency was also vulnerable.

This vulnerability is a supply chain issue because it affects many applications that depend on the vulnerable `netmask` library.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary weakness is **improper input validation** leading to incorrect parsing of octal strings. The `netmask` package **parses numeric input** without properly accounting for different radices, specifically octal representations, as stated in CVE description and the summary. This directly aligns with CWE-1389 (Incorrect Parsing of Numbers with Different Radices). The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass IP filters and perform SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1389 indicates this is ALLOWED because it is at the Base level of abstraction. CWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input) is a secondary weakness, since the package doesn't properly validate if the IP address complies with syntax rules related to octal notation. Finally, CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) is added as the potential impact of exploiting this vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1389 has no direct relationships listed. CWE-1286 has no direct relationships listed. CWE-918 has no direct relationships listed.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# CWE Examples from Database


## Known Examples for CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2016-4029** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4029](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4029): Chain: incorrect validation of intended decimal-based IP address format (CWE-1286) enables parsing of octal or hexadecimal formats (CWE-1389), allowing bypass of an SSRF protection mechanism (CWE-918).
- **CVE-2007-5893** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5893](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5893): HTTP request with missing protocol version number leads to crash
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-33195**: Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5 has functions for DNS lookups that do not validate replies from DNS servers, and thus a return value may contain an unsafe injection (e.g., XSS) that does not conform to the RFC1035 format.
- **CVE-2021-21705**: In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using URL validation functionality via filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL parameter, an URL with invalid password field can be accepted as valid. This can lead to the code incorrectly parsing the URL and potentially leading to other security implications - like contacting a wrong server or making a wrong access decision.
- **CVE-2021-23853**: In Bosch IP cameras, improper validation of the HTTP header allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers through crafted URLs.
- **CVE-2021-25465**: An improper scheme check vulnerability in Samsung Themes prior to version 5.2.01 allows attackers to perform Man-in-the-middle attack.
- **CVE-2021-29418**: The netmask package before 2.0.1 for Node.js mishandles certain unexpected characters in an IP address string, such as an octal digit of 9. This (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-28918.
- **CVE-2021-45223**: An issue was discovered in COINS Construction Cloud 11.12. Due to insufficient input neutralization, it is vulnerable to denial of service attacks via forced server crashes.
- **CVE-2021-45687**: An issue was discovered in the raw-cpuid crate before 9.1.1 for Rust. If the serialize feature is used (which is not the the default), a Deserialize operation may lack sufficient validation, leading to memory corruption or a panic.
- **CVE-2022-22176**: An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker sending a malformed DHCP packet to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). If option-82 is configured in a DHCP snooping / -security scenario, jdhcpd crashes if a specific malformed DHCP request packet is received. The DHCP functionality is impacted while jdhcpd restarts, and continued exploitation of the vulnerability will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby a sustained DoS. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 13.2 version 13.2R1 and later versions prior to 15.1R7-S11; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S6; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S7, 19.3R3-S4; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S6; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S1, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1, 21.2R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS version 12.3R12 and prior versions.


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

### Extended Description


Often, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which is either assumed by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers. The syntax could be for data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ParentOf -> CWE-112

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2016-4029:** Chain: incorrect validation of intended decimal-based IP address format (CWE-1286) enables parsing of octal or hexadecimal formats (CWE-1389), allowing bypass of an SSRF protection mechanism (CWE-918).
- **CVE-2007-5893:** HTTP request with missing protocol version number leads to crash



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
XSPA: Cross Site Port Attack
SSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-441
ChildOf -> CWE-610

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.
- **CVE-2021-26855:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-21973:** Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-1389: Incorrect Parsing of Numbers with Different Radices
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses numeric input assuming base 10 (decimal) values, but it does not account for inputs that use a different base number (radix).

### Extended Description


Frequently, a numeric input that begins with "0" is treated as octal, or "0x" causes it to be treated as hexadecimal, e.g. by the inet_addr() function. For example, "023" (octal) is 35 decimal, or "0x31" is 49 decimal. Other bases may be used as well. If the developer assumes decimal-only inputs, the code could produce incorrect numbers when the inputs are parsed using a different base. This can result in unexpected and/or dangerous behavior. For example, a "0127.0.0.1" IP address is parsed as octal due to the leading "0", whose numeric value would be the same as 87.0.0.1 (decimal), where the developer likely expected to use 127.0.0.1.


The consequences vary depending on the surrounding code in which this weakness occurs, but they can include bypassing network-based access control using unexpected IP addresses or netmasks, or causing apparently-symbolic identifiers to be processed as if they are numbers. In web applications, this can enable bypassing of SSRF restrictions.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-704

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Enforcement by Conversion
- **Description:** If only decimal-based values are expected in the application, conditional checks should be created in a way that prevent octal or hexadecimal strings from being checked. This can be achieved by converting any numerical string to an explicit base-10 integer prior to the conditional check, to prevent octal or hex values from ever being checked against the condition.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** If various numerical bases do need to be supported, check for leading values indicating the non-decimal base you wish to support (such as 0x for hex) and convert the numeric strings to integers of the respective base. Reject any other alternative-base string that is not intentionally supported by the application.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** If regular expressions are used to validate IP addresses, ensure that they are bounded using ^ and $ to prevent base-prepended IP addresses from being matched.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-29662:** Chain: Use of zero-prepended IP addresses in Perl-based IP validation module can lead to an access control bypass.
- **CVE-2021-28918:** Chain: Use of zero-prepended IP addresses in a product that manages IP blocks can lead to an SSRF.
- **CVE-2021-29921:** Chain: Use of zero-prepended IP addresses in a Python standard library package can lead to an SSRF.
