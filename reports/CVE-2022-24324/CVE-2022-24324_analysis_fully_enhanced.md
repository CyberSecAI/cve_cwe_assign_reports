# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.75 | Base | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** vulnerability exists that could cause a **stack-based buffer overflow** potentially leading to remote code execution...". While the root cause is the missing size check (CWE-120), the **weakness** itself is a **stack-based buffer overflow**, which is better represented by CWE-121. The "**stack-based buffer overflow**" is the more precise and direct description of the vulnerability's nature. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the presence of a "Stack-based buffer overflow". CWE-121 is a Variant of buffer overflow which occurs on the stack.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and is a more specific form of buffer overflow than CWE-120. The evidence points to the overflow occurring on the stack, justifying the selection of CWE-121.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "stack-based buffer overflow", and the CVE reference summary validates this).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) is considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the immediate cause that leads to the overflow, which is copying data without validating that the input buffer is smaller than the output buffer.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-120 is a base CWE that is a direct cause of the stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate confidence since CWE-120 is the root cause as per description, but the primary weakness being exploited is more accurately represented by CWE-121).

- **CVE-2021-1965**: Possible buffer overflow due to lack of parameter length check during MBSSID scan IE parse in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking
- **CVE-2021-20699**: Sharp NEC Displays ((UN462A R1.300 and prior to it, UN462VA R1.300 and prior to it, UN492S R1.300 and prior to it, UN492VS R1.300 and prior to it, UN552A R1.300 and prior to it, UN552S R1.300 and prior to it, UN552VS R1.300 and prior to it, UN552 R1.300 and prior to it, UN552V R1.300 and prior to it, UX552S R1.300 and prior to it, UX552 R1.300 and prior to it, V864Q R2.000 and prior to it, C861Q R2.000 and prior to it, P754Q R2.000 and prior to it, V754Q R2.000 and prior to it, C751Q R2.000 and prior to it, V984Q R2.000 and prior to it, C981Q R2.000 and prior to it, P654Q R2.000 and prior to it, V654Q R2.000 and prior to it, C651Q R2.000 and prior to it, V554Q R2.000 and prior to it, P404 R3.200 and prior to it, P484 R3.200 and prior to it, P554 R3.200 and prior to it, V404 R3.200 and prior to it, V484 R3.200 and prior to it, V554 R3.200 and prior to it, V404-T R3.200 and prior to it, V484-T R3.200 and prior to it, V554-T R3.200 and prior to it, C501 R2.000 and prior to it, C551 R2.000 and prior to it, C431 R2.000 and prior to it) allows an attacker a buffer overflow and to execute remote code by sending long parameters that contains specific characters in http request.
- **CVE-2021-33909**: fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05.
- **CVE-2021-3420**: A flaw was found in newlib in versions prior to 4.0.0. Improper overflow validation in the memory allocation functions mEMALIGn, pvALLOc, nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc could case an integer overflow, leading to an allocation of a small buffer and then to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2021-22659**: Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Version 21.6 and below may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted Modbus packet allowing the attacker to retrieve or modify random values in the register. If successfully exploited, this may lead to a buffer overflow resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The FAULT LED will flash RED and communications may be lost. Recovery from denial-of-service condition requires the fault to be cleared by the user.
