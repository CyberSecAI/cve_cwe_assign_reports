# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-39283

## Vulnerability Description
FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. All FreeRDP based clients when using the `/video` command line switch might read **uninitialized data**, decode it as audio/video and display the result. FreeRDP based server implementations are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 2.8.1. If you cannot upgrade do not use the `/video` switch.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized data**
- **impact:** display uninitialized data as audio/video
- **product:** FreeRDP based clients

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-39283:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper initialization when the `/video` command line switch is used in FreeRDP clients. This leads to uninitialized memory being read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The client reads from uninitialized memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The uninitialized data is interpreted as audio/video data, leading to the display of potentially nonsensical or random visual and/or audio output.
*   The impact is described as "low severity" on github.com.
*   The issue does not lead to code execution, it could be a means of leaking information, though not explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by using the `/video` command-line switch when launching a FreeRDP client.
*   A malicious RDP server, or any attacker controlling the RDP server, could trick a client into using this switch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control or influence the RDP server the client connects to, to ensure the client uses the vulnerable command-line switch.
*   The attacker doesn't need access to the client itself.

**Additional Notes:**

*   FreeRDP server implementations are explicitly stated to be not affected by this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in FreeRDP version 2.8.1.
*   A workaround is available, avoid using the `/video` switch.
