# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-4083

## Vulnerability Description
A **read-after-free** memory flaw was found in the Linux kernels garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a **race condition**. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **weakness:** **read-after-free**
- **impact:** crash the system or escalate privileges
- **attacker:** local user
- **product:** Linux kernels
- **version:** prior to 5.16-rc4
- **component:** garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers
