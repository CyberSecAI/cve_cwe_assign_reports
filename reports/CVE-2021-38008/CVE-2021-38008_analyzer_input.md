## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's the analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2021-38008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` object within Google Chrome's media handling functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The vulnerability arises when the `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` object is freed while a clone/copy of it is still being referenced. Specifically, when the stream is aborted using the JS `abort` function, it triggers the destructor of the original object but not the cloned one. Then, the cloned object can trigger an `onended` event where a double free occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting this use-after-free condition. This is because they can gain control of the freed memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted web page can trigger the vulnerability. An attacker can host a malicious web page that, when visited by a user, can exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to a user running a vulnerable version of Google Chrome.
- No special user privileges are needed. The user only needs to visit the crafted web page.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the interaction between the `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` object's cloning mechanism and its destructor/abort function.
    - The cloning process involves creating a new object using `MakeGarbageCollected`, which implies that the new object is managed by Chrome's garbage collector.
    - The stream abortion/disconnect mechanism triggers the destructor of the original object, while a cloned object still exists.
    - When the `onended` event is called, it attempts to free the cloned object which has already been freed, resulting in a use-after-free.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Marcin Towalski of Cisco Talos.
- The vulnerability affects Google Chrome versions 94.0.4606.81 (Stable) and 97.0.4674.1 (Canary).
- The CVSSv3 score is 8.3, indicating a high severity.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-416, which is the standard classification for use-after-free vulnerabilities.
- A crash log is provided, showing the exact location and type of error.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 96.0.4664.45.
