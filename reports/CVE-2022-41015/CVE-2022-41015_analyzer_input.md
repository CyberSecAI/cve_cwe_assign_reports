# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41015

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the vpn basic protocol (l2tp|pptp) name WORD server WORD username WORD passsword WORD firmwall (on|off) defroute (on|off) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-41015:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of the Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020 router. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to format command parameters into a stack buffer without proper bounds checking on the input parameter sizes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `sprintf` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without validating the size of the input data, leading to a buffer overflow when the input is larger than the buffer.
- Insufficient input validation: The `DetranCLI` does not check the size of command parameters before using them in `sprintf`, making it vulnerable to overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network packets: Attackers can send specially crafted network packets containing commands with oversized parameters through the `DetranCLI` interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send commands via the `DetranCLI` interface.
- The attacker likely needs to have authenticated access to the CLI, as the CVSS score indicates the need for high privileges.

**Specifics for CVE-2022-41015:**
- **Vulnerable Command:** `vpn basic protocol`
- **Command Template:** `vpn basic protocol (l2tp|pptp) name WORD server WORD username WORD passsword WORD firmwall (on|off) defroute (on|off)`
- **Vulnerable Code:**
  ```c
  sprintf(buff_0x100,"%d<%d<%s<%s<%s<%s<%d<%d<%s",1,based_on_argv[0],argv[1],argv[2],argv[3],argv[4],based_on_argv[5],based_on_argv[6],"");
  ```
  The `sprintf` function is used to format the command and its parameters into the `buff_0x100` buffer on the stack. If the parameters `argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, `argv[3]` or `argv[4]` are too long, they will overwrite parts of the stack.
