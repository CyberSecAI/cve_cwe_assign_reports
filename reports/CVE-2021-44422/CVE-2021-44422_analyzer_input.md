# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-44422

## Vulnerability Description
An **Improper Input Validation** Vulnerability exists when reading a BMP file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.12. Crafted data in a BMP file can trigger a **write operation past the end of an allocated buffer, or lead to a heap-based buffer overflow**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
