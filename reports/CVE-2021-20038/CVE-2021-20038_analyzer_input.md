# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-20038

## Vulnerability Description
A **Stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability in SMA100 Apache httpd server's mod_cgi module environment variables allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to potentially execute code as a 'nobody' user in the appliance. This vulnerability affected SMA 200, 210, 400, 410 and 500v appliances firmware 10.2.0.8-37sv, 10.2.1.1-19sv, 10.2.1.2-24sv and earlier versions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** SMA100 Apache httpd server
- **version:** firmware 10.2.0.8-37sv, 10.2.1.1-19sv, 10.2.1.2-24sv and earlier versions
- **component:** mod_cgi module environment variables

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20038:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `httpd` web server binary of SonicWall SMA-100 series devices due to a lack of bounds checking in the `cgi_build_command` function of the `mod_cgi.so` module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The `cgi_build_command` function uses `strcat` to append environment variables onto a stack-based buffer without any size validation. This allows a malicious attacker to generate an overly long `QUERY_STRING` and overflow the buffer, overwriting the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the affected device. Although the `httpd` process runs as the `nobody` user, attackers can then elevate to root by using the default password.
- **Complete Device Control:** Attackers can gain full control over the device, enabling them to install malware, intercept user credentials, or pivot into protected networks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request to the affected server on TCP port 443, specifically by manipulating the `QUERY_STRING` parameter to be excessively large.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by unauthenticated attackers, as the overflow occurs before any authentication checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected SonicWall device.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request with a long query string.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need any user credentials to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to guess addresses:** Because of ASLR, the attacker needs to make multiple attempts to guess the correct address to execute code. The exploit also attempts to crash other child processes to reset the stack to a predictable state

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable buffer is a 202-byte character array declared within the `cgi_handler` function. However, due to other stack variables, the attacker must overflow significantly more data.
- The system uses ASLR, but the `httpd` base address is not randomized, and the system is 32-bit, so the attacker can relatively easily guess the required library base address.
- The exploit provided uses a technique of crashing the process multiple times and trying many addresses to find a location to write the payload to. It uses a specially crafted payload with shell commands to download and execute a bind shell

The provided content also mentions a few caveats with the exploit provided:
- The exploit can fail if certain characters appear in the stack addresses that are passed as parameters to the shell command because shell parsing will fail.
- The payload has to remain less than 2500 bytes to avoid overwriting env[] and crashing

This information provides more detail than the original CVE description, detailing the specific vulnerable function, the exploitation process, and the limitations of ASLR on the affected system.
