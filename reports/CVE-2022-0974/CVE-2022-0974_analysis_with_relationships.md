# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in Splitscreen" and indicates potential **heap corruption**, which aligns precisely with CWE-416 (Use After Free). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms "**Use after free** in Splitscreen" as the root cause. CWE-416 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a Variant of several parent CWEs, including CWE-672 and CWE-825. While these parents represent broader memory management issues, CWE-416 accurately captures the specific weakness of using memory after it has been freed. There are also several "CanFollow" relationships, indicating potential impact chains, although none are directly applicable based on the current evidence.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The description explicitly states "use after free" and the evidence supports it.)
