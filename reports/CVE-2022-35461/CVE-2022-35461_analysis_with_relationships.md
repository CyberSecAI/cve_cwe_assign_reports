| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **heap-buffer overflow** in OTFCC v0.10.4, specifically at `/release-x64/otfccdump+0x6c0a32`. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states that multiple **heap buffer overflows** are present due to insufficient bounds checking when copying data into heap allocated buffers, or when writing to out-of-bounds regions of heap memory. This aligns directly with CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write], which describes writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The description and supporting evidence strongly support this classification. The Retriever Results also has CWE-787 as the highest ranked CWE with similar descriptions.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] is a base-level CWE that is a child of CWE-119 [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer]. While CWE-119 [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer] is a broader class, CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] is more specific and appropriate because it explicitly identifies the out-of-bounds write condition.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and reference materials)
