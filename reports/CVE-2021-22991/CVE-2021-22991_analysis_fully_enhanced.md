# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-22991

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE: The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **buffer overflow** due to incorrect handling of requests by the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) URI normalization. |
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The vulnerability can lead to a DoS attack, suggesting that resource allocation might be involved.  |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.6
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states a **buffer overflow** occurs due to incorrect handling of requests by the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) URI normalization. This directly aligns with CWE-120, Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'). CWE-120 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level. However, the "Allowed-with-Review" usage requires careful consideration. The description suggests a copy operation where the size of the input is not checked, which can lead to writing past the end of the buffer, satisfying the conditions for CWE-120. The impact includes a DoS attack, potentially bypassing URL-based access control, and in theory remote code execution (RCE)."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-120 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-120 provides a more specific description related to buffer copies. CWE-120 can precede CWE-123 (Write What Where Condition) if the overflow allows arbitrary writes. It can also follow CWE-456 (Missing Initialization) if the buffer isn't properly initialized. The relationship to CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is less direct but potentially relevant given the DoS impact; thus, it's identified as a secondary candidate."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence for CWE-120 based on explicit mention of **buffer overflow**. Lower confidence of 0.5 for CWE-770 due to indirect evidence of resource exhaustion.)

- **CVE-2021-20699**: Sharp NEC Displays ((UN462A R1.300 and prior to it, UN462VA R1.300 and prior to it, UN492S R1.300 and prior to it, UN492VS R1.300 and prior to it, UN552A R1.300 and prior to it, UN552S R1.300 and prior to it, UN552VS R1.300 and prior to it, UN552 R1.300 and prior to it, UN552V R1.300 and prior to it, UX552S R1.300 and prior to it, UX552 R1.300 and prior to it, V864Q R2.000 and prior to it, C861Q R2.000 and prior to it, P754Q R2.000 and prior to it, V754Q R2.000 and prior to it, C751Q R2.000 and prior to it, V984Q R2.000 and prior to it, C981Q R2.000 and prior to it, P654Q R2.000 and prior to it, V654Q R2.000 and prior to it, C651Q R2.000 and prior to it, V554Q R2.000 and prior to it, P404 R3.200 and prior to it, P484 R3.200 and prior to it, P554 R3.200 and prior to it, V404 R3.200 and prior to it, V484 R3.200 and prior to it, V554 R3.200 and prior to it, V404-T R3.200 and prior to it, V484-T R3.200 and prior to it, V554-T R3.200 and prior to it, C501 R2.000 and prior to it, C551 R2.000 and prior to it, C431 R2.000 and prior to it) allows an attacker a buffer overflow and to execute remote code by sending long parameters that contains specific characters in http request.
- **CVE-2021-33909**: fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05.
- **CVE-2021-3420**: A flaw was found in newlib in versions prior to 4.0.0. Improper overflow validation in the memory allocation functions mEMALIGn, pvALLOc, nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc could case an integer overflow, leading to an allocation of a small buffer and then to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2021-22659**: Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Version 21.6 and below may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted Modbus packet allowing the attacker to retrieve or modify random values in the register. If successfully exploited, this may lead to a buffer overflow resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The FAULT LED will flash RED and communications may be lost. Recovery from denial-of-service condition requires the fault to be cleared by the user.
