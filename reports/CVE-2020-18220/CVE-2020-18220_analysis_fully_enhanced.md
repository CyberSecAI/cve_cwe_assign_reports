# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-18220

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-329 | Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. Predictable IV with CBC mode is a specific cryptographic weakness. |
| CWE-759 | Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Vulnerability description indicates the product does not use a random salt for its encryption. |
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates the application uses a static key for AES encryption. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states the weakness is a **"Weak Encoding for Password"** because it **"does not use a random salt or IV"**. The Retriever Results show that **CWE-329 (Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode)**, a Variant, has the highest score. This aligns with the vulnerability description because it describes the specific cryptographic weakness of using a predictable IV with CBC mode encryption. Given that the vulnerability description mentions the absence of a random IV, this is a strong match. The vulnerability also states it **"does not use a random salt"**. **CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt)** aligns with this. Additionally, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the application **"uses a static key (`doracms_`) for AES encryption"**, which is described by **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-329 is a Variant of CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)) and is related to CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values). CWE-759 is a Variant of CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). CWE-321 is a Variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and corroborating information from the CVE reference).

## Known Examples for CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1526** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1526](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1526): Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2006-1058** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1058](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1058): Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21253**: OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub. OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in the voting system.
- **CVE-2021-22774**: A CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could lead an attacker to get knowledge of charging station user account credentials using dictionary attacks techniques.
- **CVE-2021-38979**: IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager 3.0, 3.0.1, 4.0, and 4.1 uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the software does not also use a salt as part of the input. IBM X-Force ID: 212785.
- **CVE-2022-40295**:  The application was vulnerable to an authenticated information disclosure, allowing administrators to view unsalted user passwords, which could lead to the compromise of plaintext passwords via offline attacks. 


## Known Examples for CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29953** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29953](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29953): Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials
- **CVE-2022-29960** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29960](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29960): Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-29964** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29964](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29964): Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access
