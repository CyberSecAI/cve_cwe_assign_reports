# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-18220

## Vulnerability Description
**Weak Encoding for Password** in DoraCMS v2.1.1 and earlier allows attackers to obtain sensitive information as it **does not use a random salt or IV** for its AES-CBC encryption, causes password encrypted for users to be susceptible to dictionary attacks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Weak Encoding for Password**
- **weakness:** **does not use a random salt or IV**
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **vector:** dictionary attacks
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** DoraCMS
- **version:** v2.1.1 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a static key (`doracms_`) for AES encryption and a static key (`dora`) for MD5 operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded cryptographic keys for encryption.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can more easily conduct brute-force password guessing due to the use of static encryption keys.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by gaining access to the encrypted data and then using the static key to decrypt or crack the passwords.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs access to the encrypted data or be able to intercept the encryption process."
