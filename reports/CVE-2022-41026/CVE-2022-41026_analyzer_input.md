# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41026

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no vpn pptp advanced name WORD dns (yes|no) mtu mru mppe (on|off) stateful (on|off) options WORD command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with format strings and command parameters without proper size checks, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to improper use of `sprintf` in command parsing.",
     "Lack of input size validation for command parameters when constructing strings."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network packets to the device that contains the vulnerable commands through the DetranCLI interface",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The specific user privileges required are not defined in the report but the CVSS score includes High privileges which suggests the attacker would likely require administrative rights to exploit."
