# Final Resolution for CVE-2020-8793

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. Mitigation: Hardcode safe search paths, use fully qualified pathnames, restrict environment settings. |
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Mitigation: Eliminate pre-use checks, limit interleaving of file operations, set appropriate gid/uid. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The selection of CWE-427 and CWE-367 is appropriate, considering their base level abstraction and direct relevance to the **root causes** described. CWE-427 is related to CWE-426 and CWE-428 as peer weaknesses related to search paths. The choice of CWE-427 over CWE-426 is driven by the fact that an *element* of the search path is controllable, not the entire path itself. CWE-367 is a specific type of race condition, which is more specific than the more general CWE-362.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **uncontrolled search path** (CWE-427) that allows an attacker to introduce malicious executables into the path used by the system. Simultaneously, a **time-of-check time-of-use race condition** (CWE-367) exists in the offline message handling, enabling an attacker to manipulate files after the initial security checks, leading to arbitrary file access. The **root cause** is the combination of these two weaknesses which leads to arbitrary file access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis and criticism are well-aligned. The selection of CWE-427 and CWE-367 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions an **untrusted search path** and **race conditions**. The vulnerability description states: "OpenSMTPD before 6.6.4 allows local users to read arbitrary files (e.g., on some Linux distributions) because of a combination of an untrusted search path in makemap.c and race conditions in the offline functionality in smtpd.c."

The graph relationships reinforced the decision to choose CWE-427 over its peers and CWE-367 over more general race condition CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they are base-level CWEs that directly represent the **root causes** of the vulnerability.
