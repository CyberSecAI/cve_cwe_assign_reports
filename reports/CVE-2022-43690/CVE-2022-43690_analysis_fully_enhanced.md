# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-43690

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1024 | Comparison of Incompatible Types | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the Concrete CMS versions below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2 had an issue with "strict comparison for the legacy_salt" leading to "limited authentication bypass". The **root cause** is the use of a non-strict comparison (== instead of ===) when checking legacy password salts, potentially involving integer conversion during comparison. This maps directly to **CWE-1024** (Comparison of Incompatible Types) since the system compares strings and integers without proper type handling. This comparison is incorrect, which leads to authentication bypass. The Retriever results show **CWE-1024** as the top candidate with a score of 0.5467, supporting this selection. The usage is ALLOWED.
  - *Explanation:* **CWE-639** (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a secondary candidate. While the vulnerability leads to an authentication bypass, the underlying issue is not directly related to user-controlled keys, but rather the improper comparison of data types. Therefore, CWE-639 is a less precise match but still relevant since the root cause leads to authorization bypass. The retriever score is 0.2708. The usage is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* **CWE-1024** does not have direct relationships, but it falls under the broader category of **CWE-697** (Incorrect Comparison) which is a Pillar. However, **CWE-1024** is a more specific Base weakness that accurately describes the vulnerability.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* **CWE-639** does not have direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence in **CWE-1024** due to the direct match with the vulnerability description and root cause analysis.)
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Medium confidence in **CWE-639** as a secondary CWE due to the resulting impact of an authentication bypass.)

## Known Examples for CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539): An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26679**: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as "profile pictures." The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.
- **CVE-2021-41847**: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.
- **CVE-2021-22906**: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.
- **CVE-2021-21012**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **CVE-2021-21013**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the customer API module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure and update arbitrary information on another user's account.
- **CVE-2021-21022**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the product module. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
- **CVE-2021-21255**: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- **CVE-2021-24318**: The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.
- **CVE-2021-26024**: The Favorites component before 1.0.2 for Nagios XI 5.8.0 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference: it is possible to create favorites for any other user account.
