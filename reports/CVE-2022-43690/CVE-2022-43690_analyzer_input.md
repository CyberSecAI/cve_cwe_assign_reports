# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-43690

## Vulnerability Description
Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2 did not use strict comparison for the legacy_salt so that limited authentication bypass could occur if using this functionality. Remediate by updating to Concrete CMS 9.1.3+ or 8.5.10+.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** limited authentication bypass
- **product:** Concrete CMS
- **version:** below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2

    "attack_vectors": "The attacker would need to exploit the vulnerability when the system compares integer representations of strings to legacy salts.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need specific privileges, but needs to find a user who signed up when the site was concrete5 ~v5.4 and has not logged in since the site was updated above v5.4 and has a password hash that looks like an integer (e.g., '0b1111111')."
