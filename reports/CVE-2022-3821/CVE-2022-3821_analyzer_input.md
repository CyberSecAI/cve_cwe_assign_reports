# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-3821

## Vulnerability Description
An off-by-one Error issue was discovered in Systemd in format_timespan() function of time-util.c. An attacker could supply specific values for time and accuracy that leads to **buffer overrun** in format_timespan(), leading to a Denial of Service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **off-by-one error**
- **weakness:** **buffer overrun**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **product:** Systemd
- **component:** time-util.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-3821:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error exists in the `format_timespan()` function within the `time-util.c` file of the systemd project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `format_timespan()` function calculates the number of bytes it will write to a buffer incorrectly, which leads to writing beyond the bounds of the provided buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. Specifically, the line `n = MIN((size_t) k, l);` where `n` becomes the size of buffer `l`, followed by `p += n;` will cause `p` to point one byte after the buffer `buf`, which then leads to an overwrite when null-terminating with `*p=0;`
- **Off-by-one Error:** The core issue is that the code allows `p` to be incremented to point beyond the end of the buffer, and then attempts to write a null terminator at that out-of-bounds location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By supplying specific values for time and accuracy, an attacker can trigger a buffer overflow, which can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior, effectively leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by supplying crafted values for `time` and `accuracy` that result in the buffer overflow during the execution of `format_timespan()`.
- The attack vector is local, meaning that an attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute code that calls the vulnerable `format_timespan()` function with malicious `time` and `accuracy` values.
- The attacker would require low privileges on the target system to trigger the vulnerability as per CVSS metrics.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adjusting the calculation of the buffer space usage, specifically by changing  `n = MIN((size_t) k, l);` to `n = MIN((size_t) k, l-1);` within the `format_timespan()` function in `time-util.c`.
- The vulnerability is present in systemd versions prior to 251.3.
- Various projects, including Fedora, Gentoo, Debian, and Buildroot were impacted by this issue and have released updates/patches.
