**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in improper handling of input data, which leads to out-of-bounds memory access (read or write), division by zero, or excessive memory allocation. This includes issues with:

*   **Image Processing:**  Handling of DCT streams and image data, including Huffman decoding and pixel manipulation.
*   **Font Handling:**  Processing of TrueType fonts, potentially due to invalid font data structures.
*  **Graphics Operations:**  Drawing strokes and filling lines, specifically when converting and handling geometric data.
*  **Type 3 Fonts:** Specific issues in how the software handles fonts of this type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashes can lead to program termination, rendering `pdf2swf` unusable for processing malicious or crafted PDF files.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, heap and stack buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution in some circumstances.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Various buffer overflows lead to memory corruption, which may have unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors involve supplying crafted PDF files to `pdf2swf`. The tool processes these files, which then triggers the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify PDF files.
*   **Tool Access:** The attacker needs access to the `pdf2swf` tool to process the crafted PDF files.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
