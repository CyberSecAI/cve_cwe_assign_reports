# Analysis for CVE-2022-35104

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                     | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :------- | :--------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **heap-buffer overflow** in the `DCTStreamreset()` function of SWFTools. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability, where the overflow occurs in memory allocated on the heap. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, detailing multiple heap buffer overflows in SWFTools, including one specifically in `DCTStream::reset`, which aligns with the described vulnerability in `DCTStreamreset()`. The description states "**heap-buffer overflow** via DCTStreamreset() at /xpdf/Stream.cc". CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a broader category that includes heap overflows, but CWE-122 is more specific and therefore more appropriate.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), indicating a direct parent-child relationship. CWE-787 describes the general condition of writing data outside the intended buffer, while CWE-122 specifies that this occurs in the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, specifically mentioning heap buffer overflow in the affected function.)
