# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3700

## Vulnerability Description
A **use-after-free** vulnerability was found in usbredir in versions prior to 0.11.0 in the usbredirparser_serialize() in usbredirparser/usbredirparser.c. This issue occurs when serializing large amounts of buffered write data in the case of a slow or blocked destination.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** usbredir
- **version:** prior to 0.11.0
- **component:** usbredirparser_serialize() in usbredirparser/usbredirparser.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `usbredirparser_serialize()` function within the `usbredirparser/usbredirparser.c` file. This occurs when serializing large amounts of buffered write data. Specifically, when the `serialize_data` function reallocates the state buffer (default size 64kB) due to a slow or blocked write destination, the pointer to where the write buffer count is written can point outside of the reallocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: A memory location is freed, and a pointer to that memory is still used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use-after-free could lead to a crash.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Though considered unlikely by the author, the vulnerability could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if a carefully crafted value is written to the freed memory before the intended write operation. This depends on the value written to the location that was freed when the buffer reallocates. Successful exploitation would require precise timing and specific host system conditions, and it's considered difficult to achieve reliably.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during serialization of the usbredir protocol, typically invoked by QEMU during migration, especially with features like COLO.
- The attacker would need to:
  1. Have a guest system that is sending large amounts of buffered write data via usbredir.
  2. Cause the write destination to be slow or blocked.
  3.  Ensure that the write buffers are "groomed" to trigger the vulnerability during the brief window where the pointer is invalid. This includes ensuring the right value is written into the memory that was freed by the reallocation, just before the write buffer count is written

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have control over a guest system sending data through usbredir. This is typically a virtual machine environment that is using usbredir for USB redirection to the host machine.
- The attacker doesn't have precise control over the serialization process which happens under QEMU's I/O lock.  The attacker would need to influence the host system through the guest to achieve the right conditions for the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `usbredirparser/usbredirparser.c`.
*   The affected function is `usbredirparser_serialize()`.
*   The issue arises when serializing large amounts of buffered write data, particularly in scenarios involving slow or blocked destinations.
*   A patch has been created to fix this issue, specifically commit `03c519ff5831ba75120e00ebebbf1d5a1f7220ab` in the usbredir repository
*   The fix was included in usbredir version 0.11.0.
