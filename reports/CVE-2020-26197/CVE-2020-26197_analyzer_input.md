# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-26197

## Vulnerability Description
Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.1.0 - 9.1.0 contains an LDAP Provider **inability to connect over TLSv1.2** vulnerability. It may make it easier to eavesdrop and decrypt such traffic for a malicious actor. Note This does not affect clusters which are not relying on an LDAP server for the authentication provider.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **inability to connect over TLSv1.2**
- **impact:** eavesdrop and decrypt traffic
- **attacker:** malicious actor
- **product:** Dell PowerScale OneFS
- **version:** 8.1.0 - 9.1.0
- **component:** LDAP Provider

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-26197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the LDAP provider in Dell PowerScale OneFS failing to establish connections using TLSv1.2. This inability to use the more secure TLSv1.2 protocol potentially leaves the communication vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Connection:** The primary weakness is the inability to connect over TLSv1.2, which means connections might fall back to less secure protocols, such as TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1.
*   **Eavesdropping Risk:** The fallback to less secure protocols can allow a malicious actor to eavesdrop and potentially decrypt the traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data transmitted between the LDAP server and the PowerScale OneFS system. This data could include usernames, passwords, and other authentication-related information.
*   **Compromised Authentication:** If an attacker can intercept and decrypt the traffic, they could potentially compromise the authentication process, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system or its resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the PowerScale OneFS system and the LDAP server can intercept the traffic.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker might be able to perform a MitM attack to intercept and manipulate the communication if weaker protocols are used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to intercept the traffic between the PowerScale OneFS system and the LDAP server.
*   **Eavesdropping Capability:** The attacker needs the capability to monitor and potentially decrypt the traffic.

**Additional Details**

*   **Affected Products:** Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.1.0 through 9.1.0 are affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Disabling LDAP providers can be a temporary mitigation. Upgrading to a patched version of OneFS is the recommended solution.
*   **Affected Configurations:** This vulnerability only affects clusters relying on an LDAP server for the authentication provider. Clusters using other methods of authentication are not affected.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5, indicating a high severity.
