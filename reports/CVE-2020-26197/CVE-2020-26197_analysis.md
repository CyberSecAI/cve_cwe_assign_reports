|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that the Dell PowerScale OneFS has an **inability to connect over TLSv1.2** when using an LDAP provider. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the **primary weakness is the inability to connect over TLSv1.2**, which means connections might fall back to less secure protocols, such as TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1. The impact is that a malicious actor could **eavesdrop and decrypt the traffic**. This directly aligns with CWE-319 [Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information], which describes transmitting sensitive data in cleartext over a communication channel that can be sniffed. While the vulnerability isn't directly transmitting in cleartext, the inability to negotiate TLSv1.2 effectively renders the connection vulnerable to cleartext sniffing if it falls back to weaker protocols. This is an allowed mapping as it aligns with the characteristics of the vulnerability. The retriever result gives a score of 0.3921, with the sparse retriever result scoring 0.319 and graph retriever scoring 0.587.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-327 [Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm] is a possible secondary CWE because the **inability to connect over TLSv1.2** implies that the system is either using a broken algorithm by falling back to older versions of TLS, or is misconfigured in a way that prevents the use of a strong encryption algorithm. However, the primary issue is about the cleartext transmission due to the fallback, therefore CWE-319 is more appropriate. MITRE Mapping Guidance marks this as Allowed-with-Review. The retriever result gives a score of 953.24, however, it is less descriptive than CWE-319.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate evidence because fallback to older protocols is implied but not explicitly stated)
