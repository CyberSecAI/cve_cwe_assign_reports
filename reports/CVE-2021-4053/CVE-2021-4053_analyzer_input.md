## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-4053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory is still used, leading to a potentially exploitable situation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The provided resources indicates this vulnerability is considered "High" severity, and could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service or information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is within the UI component of the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the use-after-free condition in the UI component of the browser.  This might involve crafting specific UI interactions or web content that exploits the memory management issue.  The provided content doesn't specify the exact method, but it is considered "remote" exploitable, suggesting the attack does not require direct access to the target machine.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-4053 is a high-severity use-after-free vulnerability in the UI of the Chrome browser and its derivatives. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could achieve remote code execution, denial of service or information disclosure.
