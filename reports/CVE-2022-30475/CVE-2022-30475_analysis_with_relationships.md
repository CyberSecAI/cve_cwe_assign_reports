# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-30475 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" in the httpd module of the Tenda AC18 router when handling the /goform/WifiExtraSet request. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `fromSetWirelessRepeat` function copies user-provided data from the `wpapsk_crypto` parameter into a stack-based buffer without proper length checks, leading to a buffer overflow. This aligns precisely with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant-level CWE and considered an acceptable level of abstraction for mapping root causes. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) could also be considered, CWE-121 is more specific because the buffer is located on the stack. The retriever results also ranked CWE-121 highly.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a child of CWE-119 and a parent of CWE-121. The relationship between CWE-121 and CWE-787 is that a stack-based buffer overflow is a specific type of out-of-bounds write.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials specifically mentioning a stack-based buffer overflow.)
