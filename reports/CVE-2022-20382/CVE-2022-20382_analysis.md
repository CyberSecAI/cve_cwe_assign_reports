# Analysis for CVE-2022-20382

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-675 | Duplicate Operations on Resource | 0.85 | Base | Primary | The root cause is an incorrect implementation that leads to duplicate operations on the superblock, and ultimately a stack overflow. |
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | The stack overflow is a consequence of the recursive calls, but not the direct root cause. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is caused by the `incfs_mount_fs()` function incorrectly handling multiple mount requests, allocating a new superblock for each call, leading to recursive calls and a **kernel stack overflow**. The root cause of the issue isn't the stack overflow itself, but rather the logic that causes multiple operations to be performed on the same resource. This aligns with CWE-675 (Duplicate Operations on Resource). CWE-675 is a base level CWE. CWE-121 is included as a secondary issue, because the stack overflow itself is a consequence of the vulnerability, and it is a buffer overflow on the stack, but is not the best fit for the root cause.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-675 does not have defined parent/child relationships, but is a base CWE, suggesting it is a fundamental issue. CWE-121 is a type of buffer overflow, specifically on the stack.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence based on the detailed description of the root cause and the technical details provided in the CVE reference. The kernel stack overflow results from the **duplicate operations**.)
