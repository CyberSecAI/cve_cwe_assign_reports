## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**stack overflow**" in the `formSetPortMapping` function of Tenda routers G1 and G3. This directly corresponds to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. The vulnerability is triggered via parameters such as `portMappingServer`, `portMappingProtocol`, etc. leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). CWE-121 is a Variant level CWE, which is preferred. The retriever results also show CWE-121 as the top candidate. Although CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a more general case, the specific mention of "stack" makes CWE-121 the most appropriate choice.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of buffer overflow and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a broader class, CWE-121 provides a more specific characterization of the vulnerability, making it a better fit.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.90 (Strong evidence due to the direct mention of stack overflow.)
