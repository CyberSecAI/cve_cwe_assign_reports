**Root Cause:** Access of memory location after end of buffer. This indicates a buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to access a memory location beyond the allocated buffer, likely due to an error in bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited locally (AV:L).
- It requires low attack complexity (AC:L).
- User interaction (UI:R) is required for exploitation.
- No privileges are required (PR:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where Adobe Premiere Pro is installed.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a specially crafted file.

**Additional Information:**
- The CVSS score is 7.8 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact regarding confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
