# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41028

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no vpn schedule name1 WORD name2 WORD policy (failover|backup) description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer without checking the size of the input parameters, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked input lengths when using `sprintf` to format command parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution by sending a specially crafted network packet.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a sequence of requests to the vulnerable `DetranCLI` interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. High privileges are required to access the CLI.

The provided content gives a detailed breakdown of multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities, including the specific commands and vulnerable code snippets. This is significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.
