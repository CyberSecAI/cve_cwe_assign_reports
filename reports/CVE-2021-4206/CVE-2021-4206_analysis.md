# Analysis for CVE-2021-4206

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The **integer overflow** is the root cause, leading to a heap overflow. |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The integer overflow results in a small allocation, leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow** when the system writes past the allocated buffer. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states an **integer overflow** in the cursor_alloc() function leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow**. The CVE reference confirms the root cause is an integer overflow when calculating the buffer size for cursor allocation. This aligns with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) as the primary weakness. The subsequent **heap-based buffer overflow** is a direct consequence of the undersized buffer, making CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) a relevant secondary weakness. Both CWEs are at appropriate abstraction levels (Base and Variant respectively) and their usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance. The attack involves setting large values for width and height, which triggers the overflow during the buffer size calculation."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-190 is a Base level CWE, and CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-190 **CanPrecede** CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and thus CWE-122, as the integer overflow leads to the out-of-bounds write. In this case, there's a clear sequence: Integer Overflow leading to Heap Overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear technical description and CVE reference details.)
