# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-26727

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple command injections and stack-based buffer overflows vulnerabilities in the SubNet_handler_func function of spx_restservice allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the server user (root). This issue affects Lanner Inc IAC-AST2500A standard firmware version 1.10.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** Lanner Inc IAC-AST2500A
- **version:** standard firmware version 1.10.0
- **component:** SubNet_handler_func function of spx_restservice

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-26727:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of command injection and stack-based buffer overflows within the `spx_restservice`'s `SubNet_handler_func`. Specifically, the function uses an externally controlled HTTP parameter without proper length validation, leading to the overflow, and the use of `safe_system` which allows for the injection of arbitrary OS commands via the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection:** The `safe_system` function, despite its name, allows for the injection of arbitrary OS commands due to the lack of proper sanitization.
*   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The function copies an externally controlled string into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without checking the input length, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the BMC.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Since the processes run with root privileges, this leads to complete control of the BMC and potentially the managed host.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the BMC.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the BMC's web interface.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided CVSS v3.1 score is 10 (Critical), reflecting the severity of the vulnerability due to the potential for unauthenticated RCE.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Lanner IAC-AST2500A expansion card firmware, which is based on the AMI MegaRAC SP-X solution.
