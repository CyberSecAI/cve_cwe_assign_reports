# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap-buffer overflow**" within OTFCC v0.10.4. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) directly corresponds to this type of vulnerability. It occurs when a buffer allocated on the heap is overwritten, leading to potential code execution or denial of service. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" also lists CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary CWE, which is a parent of CWE-122. Given the explicit mention of "heap," CWE-122 is the more specific and appropriate choice.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The relationship analysis supports choosing CWE-122 because it specifies the location of the buffer overflow as the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "heap-buffer overflow" in the vulnerability description.)
