|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-415 | Double Free | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**double free**" condition in WebGL in Google Chrome. This directly corresponds to CWE-415, which is defined as "The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations." The key phrase "**double free**" aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-415. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-415 indicates that it is ALLOWED for this type of vulnerability.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-415 is a variant-level CWE, making it more specific than its class-level parents. While other CWEs like CWE-416 (Use After Free) are related to memory management issues, the explicit mention of a "**double free**" makes CWE-415 the most accurate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match with high confidence based on vulnerability description)
