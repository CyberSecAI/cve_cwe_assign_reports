## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an "out of bounds memory access" in the WebGL component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds memory access:** This means that the software is attempting to read or write to a memory location that it is not authorized to access, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity, suggesting that successful exploitation could have significant consequences.
*   Out-of-bounds memory access can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (crashes) or potentially to read sensitive data from other parts of memory. Depending on the specific implementation of the memory access, it could potentially lead to code execution as well.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is located in WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within a web browser. An attacker would need to craft a malicious website or web page that exploits this vulnerability through the use of WebGL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to have the targeted user visit a malicious webpage, or to inject the exploit into a webpage the targeted user visits.
*   The attacker needs an understanding of the vulnerability in WebGL to craft a working exploit.

**Summary**

CVE-2022-2008 is an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in the WebGL component of Chromium. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious website to cause a denial of service or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
