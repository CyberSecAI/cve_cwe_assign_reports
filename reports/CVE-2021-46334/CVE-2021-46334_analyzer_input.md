# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-46334

## Vulnerability Description
Moddable SDK v11.5.0 was discovered to contain a **stack buffer overflow** via the component __interceptor_strcat.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**
- **product:** Moddable SDK
- **version:** v11.5.0
- **component:** __interceptor_strcat

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a stack buffer overflow in the `__interceptor_strcat` function.
- This occurs because the source map support attempts to reuse a fixed-size `path` buffer, which is insufficient for the combined string being processed. Specifically, the code attempts to concatenate strings into the buffer without ensuring enough space is available, causing a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the allocated space of a buffer on the stack.
- **Insufficient Buffer Size:** The code does not properly check the length of the combined strings before performing the concatenation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:**  The stack buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the overflowed data. This is suggested by the "stack smashing detected" message in the No-ASAN output.
- **Program Crash:** As seen in both ASAN and non-ASAN output the program crashes due to the overflow corrupting the stack. The ASAN output provides detailed information, including the address of the overflow and the affected stack frame and variables, while the non-ASAN output shows a "stack smashing detected" error, which is a security mechanism indicating the stack memory was corrupted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Source Map:** An attacker could craft a malicious JavaScript file with a large sourceMappingURL that, when processed by `xst`, leads to the buffer overflow during string concatenation.
- **JavaScript File Processing:**  The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of JavaScript files that include source maps, which provides an attack vector via manipulating these files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide malicious input:** An attacker would need to provide a JavaScript file with a crafted source map that causes the string concatenation to overflow the buffer.
- **Target a vulnerable system:** The attacker would need to target a system running the vulnerable version of Moddable-XS and use the `xst` tool to process the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was found and reported by the OWL337 team.
- The issue was confirmed, a fix was developed, and the fix was verified.
- The fix likely involves allocating a temporary buffer that is large enough to hold the concatenated string, instead of relying on the fixed-size `path` buffer.
- The ASAN output provides specific details about the location of the overflow, the affected stack frame, and shadow bytes, making the debugging and understanding the exploit easier, and confirming the stack overflow vulnerability.
