# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack-based overflows**" and crashes in the FUR to VGM converter within tildearrow Furnace dev73. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating a "**stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability (CWE-121, CWE-787, CWE-119)". This directly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant of a buffer overflow occurring specifically on the stack. The description details the component (FUR to VGM converter in console mode), the trigger (user interaction), and the impact (crashes), all supporting a stack-based buffer overflow scenario. The evidence is further strengthened by the mention of fuzz testing as the discovery method and the provided commits `3a7a132` and `258a905` which fixed the vulnerability by hardening the file loader to prevent out-of-bounds access. CWE-787 is considered as secondary because it is a general out-of-bounds write, and CWE-121 is a specific case of that, and the description mentions stack. CWE-119, while relevant as a parent class, is less specific than CWE-121 and CWE-787.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-121 is also a specific type of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), focusing on stack-based overflows. The exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to explicit mention of stack-based overflow and corroborating CVE details)
