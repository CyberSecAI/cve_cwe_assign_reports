# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack-based buffer overflow**" and the CVE reference links content summary further confirms the **root cause** as a "**Stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability". This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant level CWE. The vulnerability occurs in the `FsBrowseClean` functionality due to the use of `sprintf` with a fixed-size buffer and user-controlled input (`path` parameter) without any size validation. This allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, leading to remote code execution. The mapping guidance for CWE-121 specifies that it is ALLOWED. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) could also be considered, CWE-121 is more specific because it identifies the overflow occurs on the stack.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-121 is more specific in this case, as it identifies the location of the buffer on the stack. CWE-121 is also a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of "stack-based buffer overflow" and detailed technical analysis in the CVE reference materials)
