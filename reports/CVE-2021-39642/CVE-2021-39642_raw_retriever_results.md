# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-39642

## Query
In synchronous_process_io_entries of lwis_ioctl.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android kernelAndroid ID A-195731663References N/A

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: race condition
- **weakness**: out of bounds write
