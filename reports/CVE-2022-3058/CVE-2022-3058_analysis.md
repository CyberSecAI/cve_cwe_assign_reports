## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the root cause, which directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this by stating: "Root Cause of Vulnerability: - Use-after-free in the Sign-In Flow." CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). The vulnerability could potentially lead to other issues such as CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) or CWE-415 (Double Free), but the primary weakness is the use after free itself.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
