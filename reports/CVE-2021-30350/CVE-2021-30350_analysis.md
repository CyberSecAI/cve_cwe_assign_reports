# Analysis for CVE-2021-30350

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | The **lack of MBN header size verification against input buffer** is directly related to the improper validation of the size of the buffer. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Due to the **lack of MBN header size verification against input buffer**, an out-of-bounds write can occur, leading to memory corruption. |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.55 | Base | Allowed | The **lack of MBN header size verification against input buffer** implies that buffer size is either incorrectly calculated or not checked, leading to potential memory corruption. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is the **lack of MBN header size verification against input buffer**, which directly leads to potential memory corruption. This aligns best with CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), as the size of the MBN header is a quantity that should be validated. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also relevant as the **lack of verification** can lead to writing beyond the buffer's boundaries. CWE-131 is a weaker match because the problem is not necessarily incorrect calculation but the **lack of validation** of the size.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 is a base level weakness. CWE-787 can follow from CWE-1284, as improper size validation can lead to out-of-bounds writes. CWE-131 can also precede CWE-787, as an incorrect size calculation is a common cause of out-of-bounds writes.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (The vulnerability description clearly states the root cause and the potential impact.)
