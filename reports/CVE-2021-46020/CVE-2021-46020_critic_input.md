# Critic Input for CVE-2021-46020



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An **untrusted pointer dereference** in mrb_vm_exec() of mruby v3.0.0 can lead to a segmentation fault or application crash.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **untrusted pointer dereference**
- **impact:** segmentation fault or application crash
- **product:** mruby
- **version:** v3.0.0
- **component:** mrb_vm_exec()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An untrusted pointer dereference in the `mrb_vm_exec()` function within mruby v3.0.0. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when accessing object properties after calling `mrb_get_args()`, especially in functions like `mrb_ary_shift_m()` or `mrb_as_float()`.  This leads to accessing invalid memory locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Untrusted pointer dereference
- Potential reentrancy issues in mruby VM when using `mrb_get_args()`
- Use-after-free vulnerability in array/string manipulation functions (like `Array#rotate`, `Array#rotate!`, `String#byteslice`, and potentially `String#rindex`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault
- Application crash

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing specially crafted input to mruby that triggers the vulnerable code path within `mrb_vm_exec()`, especially when handling arguments in functions such as `mrb_ary_shift_m()`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a crafted Ruby script to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute mruby code with the vulnerable version (v3.0.0)
- Understanding of mruby internals or ability to craft inputs based on reverse engineering or fuzzing.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to argument handling within the mruby virtual machine.
- The issue stems from incorrect management of stack variables after calling `mrb_get_args()` which could lead to use-after-free or access of invalid memory locations.
- The fix involves adjusting the stack and recalculating the `ci` (callinfo) variable after calling `mrb_get_args()` and refactoring how `mrb_as_float` handles generic objects.
- Patches were made in PRs #5619 and #5620.
- The issue was addressed by making changes in the functions like `mrb_ary_shift_m`, ensuring object properties are accessed correctly and also making changes to stack and call information after `mrb_get_args()` is invoked and ensuring `mrb_as_float` only calls `to_f` on Rational or Complex numbers.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an "**untrusted pointer dereference**" in the `mrb_vm_exec()` function of mruby v3.0.0. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further elaborates that this **untrusted pointer dereference** occurs when accessing object properties after calling `mrb_get_args()`, leading to access of invalid memory locations. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference): "The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer." The description and the CVE summary both point to the same root cause, making CWE-822 a strong primary candidate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-822 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED, which supports the selection.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-822 doesn't have direct parent-child relationships listed in the provided information, it is related to other pointer-related weaknesses. The Retriever Results indicate that CWE-822 can follow or precede other pointer-related CWEs. Given the information provided, the primary weakness is directly related to the **untrusted pointer dereference** which is accurately captured by CWE-822.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match in vulnerability description and CVE summary)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE summary mention that the **untrusted pointer dereference** can lead to a segmentation fault or application crash. While the primary issue is the **untrusted pointer dereference**, the potential for a NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) cannot be entirely ruled out, especially since accessing invalid memory locations could result in attempting to dereference a NULL pointer. However, the primary focus is on the untrusted nature of the pointer itself rather than explicitly a NULL dereference. Therefore, CWE-476 is considered a secondary candidate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-476 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED, which supports the selection.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-476 is a base level CWE. Given the lack of explicit mention of NULL dereference as the root cause, it is a secondary mapping.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate confidence, as it is a possible consequence, but not the primary weakness as described)

## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).


There are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:


  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.

  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between "userland" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).

  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-5655:** message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.
- **CVE-2010-2299:** labeled as a "type confusion" issue, also referred to as a "stale pointer." However, the bug ID says "contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly". The "handle" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).
- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.
