|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-378 | Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states a "**creation of temporary file with insecure permissions**" vulnerability in hawk2, which directly corresponds to CWE-378 (Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions). The CVE reference summary confirms that temporary files are created with insecure permissions (0666), allowing local users to read and write them. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-378. The impact of this vulnerability, local attackers escalating to root, is a consequence of the insecure permissions. CWE-378 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-378 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct relationships for CWE-378 in the provided information, the broader context of file permission vulnerabilities suggests a potential relationship with CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource), which is a Class-level weakness. However, given the specific focus on temporary files, CWE-378 is more appropriate. The relationship with CWE-276 Installation of Files with Insecure Permissions is also relevant.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE reference summary)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The creation of temporary files with insecure permissions during installation could be related to CWE-276 (Installation of Files with Insecure Permissions). The vulnerability arises because the installed file permissions allow anyone to modify those files, which is directly relevant to the **rootcause**. However, the primary issue is the creation of temporary files with weak permissions, not the permissions of installed files. Therefore, CWE-276 is a secondary candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-276 is related to CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) as they both deal with permissions. However, CWE-276 is more specific to installation, while CWE-732 is a more general class.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence as this is related but not the primary weakness)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
    - *Explanation:* CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is a potential candidate because the vulnerability involves insecure file permissions. However, the specific issue is the creation of *temporary* files with insecure permissions, which is more precisely described by CWE-378. CWE-732 is a more general class, and its usage is "Allowed-with-Review" due to frequent misuse. Since we have a more specific Base CWE (CWE-378), we should prefer it.

    - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-732 is a parent of CWE-276 (Installation of Files with Insecure Permissions) and has relationships with other permission-related CWEs. However, these relationships do not make it a better fit than CWE-378.

- **Confidence Score:**
    - *Example:* Confidence: 0.5 (Low confidence as the description matches only generally, and a more specific CWE is available)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-43037**: An issue was discovered in Kaseya Unitrends Backup Appliance before 10.5.5. The Unitrends Windows agent was vulnerable to DLL injection and binary planting due to insecure default permissions. This allowed privilege escalation from an unprivileged user to SYSTEM.
- **CVE-2020-9451**: An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe keeps a log in a folder where unprivileged users have write permissions. The logs are generated in a predictable pattern, allowing an unprivileged user to create a hardlink from a (not yet created) log file to anti_ransomware_service.exe. On reboot, this forces the anti_ransomware_service to try to write its log into its own process, crashing in a SHARING VIOLATION. This crash occurs on every reboot.
- **CVE-2021-31540**: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.5 (in a default installation) has incorrect file permissions of configuration files in the conf/ directory. A regular local user is able to read and write to all the configuration files, e.g., modify the application server configuration.
