# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-20203 with Relationship Information

```markdown
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. Matches the **memory corruption** mentioned in the vulnerability description. |
| CWE-123 | Write-what-where Condition | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Could be present if the attacker has control over the value being written and where it's written |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that there is a way to **corrupt memory** when decoding untrusted protobuf files in the nanopb library. The **memory corruption** can lead to local escalation of privilege. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) describes a scenario where the product writes data outside the intended buffer boundaries, leading to **memory corruption**. The provided description aligns with this CWE. While the description lacks explicit details about the out-of-bounds write, the **memory corruption** is a strong indicator. The 'Retriever Results' also lists CWE-787 with a decent score. The relationship analysis reveals that CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-787 is more specific."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) is a peer of CWE-787 and could be a secondary issue if the attacker has more control on what and where to write."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the description of **memory corruption** during protobuf decoding)
