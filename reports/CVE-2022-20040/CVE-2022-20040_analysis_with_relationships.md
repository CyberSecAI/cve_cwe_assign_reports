# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                       | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0        | Variant               | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **stack-based buffer overflow** as the **rootcause**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this by stating "The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow" and lists "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow" as a weakness. CWE-121 is a Variant of buffer overflow, specific to the stack, which aligns perfectly with the description.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Buffer Overflow). While CWE-119 could be a higher-level classification, the description specifically mentions it is stack-based, making CWE-121 a more precise and appropriate mapping.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit statement of stack-based buffer overflow)
