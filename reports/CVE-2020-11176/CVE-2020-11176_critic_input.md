# Analysis to Review
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability is a heap overflow, which directly relates to writing outside the intended buffer boundaries. |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Allowed | This is a broader category that includes out-of-bounds write. While CWE-787 is more specific, CWE-119 is still relevant as the root cause involves improper memory boundary handling. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | There could be an improper validation of the size or length in the input, leading to a heap overflow |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states that a **heap overflow** occurs during server certificate processing in IPSec. This aligns directly with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as a heap overflow is a specific type of out-of-bounds write where data is written beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. The description also mentions "memory corruption," which is a typical impact of CWE-787. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a broader class that encompasses CWE-787. While CWE-787 is a more precise classification, CWE-119 is relevant because the root cause is the failure to properly restrict memory operations within the allocated bounds. There also could be an Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (CWE-1284). This is because to allocate the certificate, the size needs to be determined somehow, which could lead to a heap overflow.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-787 is a base level CWE that is a child of CWE-119. This parent-child relationship supports the selection of CWE-787 as the primary weakness due to its higher specificity. CWE-787 can precede CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), CWE-824 (Improper Check for Pointer Validity Before Dereference), and CWE-825 (Missing Check against an Alternate Path or Channel). While not explicitly stated, a possible chain of events is that an out-of-bounds write can lead to dereferencing an untrusted pointer."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence of heap overflow and memory corruption).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.


Programs may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.


If an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.


### Alternative Terms
Untrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of "out-of-range" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2010-2160:** Invalid offset in undocumented opcode leads to memory corruption.
- **CVE-2010-1281:** Multimedia player uses untrusted value from a file when using file-pointer calculations.
- **CVE-2009-3129:** Spreadsheet program processes a record with an invalid size field, which is later used as an offset.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).


There are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:


  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.

  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between "userland" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).

  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-5655:** message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.
- **CVE-2010-2299:** labeled as a "type confusion" issue, also referred to as a "stale pointer." However, the bug ID says "contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly". The "handle" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).
- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read



## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.

### Extended Description
When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-5013:** access of expired memory address leads to arbitrary code execution
- **CVE-2010-3257:** stale pointer issue leads to denial of service and possibly other consequences
- **CVE-2008-0062:** Chain: a message having an unknown message type may cause a reference to uninitialized memory resulting in a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) or dangling pointer (CWE-825), possibly crashing the system or causing heap corruption.
