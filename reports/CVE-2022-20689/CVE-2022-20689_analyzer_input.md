# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-20689

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause Cisco Discovery Protocol memory corruption on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to **missing length validation checks** when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid Cisco Discovery Protocol packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal Cisco Discovery Protocol database of the affected device.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### Summary of CVE-2022-20689

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by missing length validation checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing length validation when processing CDP messages leading to an out-of-bounds read

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption within the Cisco Discovery Protocol database
- Potential for further exploitation due to the corruption

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device.
- Attacker must be Layer 2 adjacent to the affected device (same broadcast domain)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the vulnerable Cisco ATA device.
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability
