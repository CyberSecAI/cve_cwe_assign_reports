# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-3833

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-3833

## Query
Integria IMS login check uses a loose comparator (==) to compare the MD5 hash of the password provided by the user and the MD5 hash stored in the database. An attacker with a specific formatted password could exploit this vulnerability in order to login in the system with different passwords.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: loose comparator (==) to compare the MD5 hash
