# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3833

## Vulnerability Description
Integria IMS login check uses a **loose comparator (==) to compare the MD5 hash** of the password provided by the user and the MD5 hash stored in the database. An attacker with a specific formatted password could exploit this vulnerability in order to login in the system with different passwords.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **loose comparator (==) to compare the MD5 hash**
- **impact:** login with different passwords
- **vector:** specific formatted password
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Integria IMS
- **component:** login check

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a loose comparison operator (`==`) in the Integria IMS login check. This operator is used to compare the MD5 hash of the password provided by the user with the MD5 hash stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Comparison (CWE-697):** The use of a loose comparison operator `==` instead of a strict comparison `===` allows for type juggling and potential bypass of the authentication mechanism.
- **MD5 Hash:** Although not directly a weakness of this CVE, the use of MD5 for password hashing is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks, and is a contributing factor to the ease of exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the Integria IMS system by using a specially crafted password that produces a hash that can bypass the loose comparison.
- **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the system, allowing the attacker to perform malicious actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely, requiring only network access to the Integria IMS login page.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability resides in the login functionality accessible through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running Integria IMS.
- **Knowledge of Weakness:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability (i.e., the loose comparison) to craft a suitable malicious password.
- **No User Account Needed:** No valid user account is required to exploit the vulnerability; it can be used to bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Integria IMS version 5.0.93.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8, indicating critical severity.
- The vulnerability was discovered by @nag0mez with a special mention to @\_Barriuso.
- The INCIBE-2021-0405 code is associated with this vulnerability.
