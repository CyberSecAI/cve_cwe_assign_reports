## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The core issue lies in the **incorrect comparison** using a loose comparator (`==`) instead of a strict comparator (`===`) in the login check. This directly aligns with **CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison)**, which describes a scenario where a comparison between two entities in a security-relevant context is flawed, leading to potential bypasses or vulnerabilities. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions this **incorrect comparison** as a key weakness. While the use of MD5 is a contributing factor, the immediate cause is the flawed comparison logic. CWE-697 is a Class-level CWE, and while more specific variants might exist, the available information doesn't pinpoint a more precise weakness. The Retriever Results highlight CWE-916 and CWE-328 due to the password hashing aspect; however, the more direct root cause is the comparison error." Furthermore, the use of MD5, a weak hashing algorithm, contributes to the vulnerability, making **CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort)** and **CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash)** as contributing factors that can be considered.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-697 is a Pillar-level CWE and does not have direct relationships to more specific weaknesses in the Retriever Results. However, it is a general class of errors, and the context implies it CanPrecede authentication bypass. Considering the hashing algorithm used (**MD5**), **CWE-916** (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and **CWE-328** (Use of Weak Hash) are considered in the analysis because they could lead to an authentication bypass."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3116** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3116](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3116): Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)
- **CVE-2020-15811** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15811](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15811): Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning
- **CVE-2016-10003** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10003](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10003): Proxy performs incorrect comparison of request headers, leading to infoleak
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-3833**: Integria IMS login check uses a loose comparator ("==") to compare the MD5 hash of the password provided by the user and the MD5 hash stored in the database. An attacker with a specific formatted password could exploit this vulnerability in order to login in the system with different passwords. 
- **CVE-2021-32779**: Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions envoy incorrectly handled a URI '#fragment' element as part of the path element. Envoy is configured with an RBAC filter for authorization or similar mechanism with an explicit case of a final "/admin" path element, or is using a negative assertion with final path element of "/admin". The client sends request to "/app1/admin#foo". In Envoy prior to 1.18.0, or 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=false. Envoy treats fragment as a suffix of the query string when present, or as a suffix of the path when query string is absent, so it evaluates the final path element as "/admin#foo" and mismatches with the configured "/admin" path element. In Envoy 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=true. Envoy transforms this to /app1/admin%23foo and mismatches with the configured /admin prefix. The resulting URI is sent to the next server-agent with the offending "#foo" fragment which violates RFC3986 or with the nonsensical "%23foo" text appended. A specifically constructed request with URI containing '#fragment' element delivered by an untrusted client in the presence of path based request authorization resulting in escalation of Privileges when path based request authorization extensions. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes that removes fragment from URI path in incoming requests.
- **CVE-2021-35970**: Talk 4 in Coral before 4.12.1 allows remote attackers to discover e-mail addresses and other sensitive information via GraphQL because permission checks use an incorrect data type.
- **CVE-2020-22784**: In Etherpad UeberDB < 0.4.4, due to MySQL omitting trailing spaces on char / varchar columns during comparisons, retrieving database records using UeberDB's MySQL connector could allow bypassing access controls enforced on key names.
- **CVE-2020-25580**: In FreeBSD 12.2-STABLE before r369346, 11.4-STABLE before r369345, 12.2-RELEASE before p4 and 11.4-RELEASE before p8 a regression in the login.access(5) rule processor has the effect of causing rules to fail to match even when they should not. This means that rules denying access may be ignored.
- **CVE-2021-1904**: Child process can leak information from parent process due to numeric pids are getting compared and these pid can be reused in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables
- **CVE-2021-34865**: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of multiple NETGEAR routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the mini_httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from incorrect string matching logic when accessing protected pages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-13313.
