|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that a "stack-based overflow" can be triggered. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The description also mentions "re-use of dangling pointer which refers to overwritten space in memory" which could be related to CWE-824(Access of Uninitialized Pointer) or CWE-787(Out-of-bounds Write). Given the limited information, CWE-121 appears to be the most precise and well-supported mapping. CWE-119 is listed as primary CWE Match for similar CVE Descriptions.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119, making it more specific. CWE-787 can follow CWE-824.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.8 (Moderate evidence due to explicit mention of stack-based overflow).
