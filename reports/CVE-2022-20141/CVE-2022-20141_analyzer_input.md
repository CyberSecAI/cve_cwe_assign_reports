# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-20141

## Vulnerability Description
In ip_check_mc_rcu of igmp.c, there is a possible **use after free** due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege when opening and closing inet sockets with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android kernelAndroid ID A-112551163References Upstream kernel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20141:

**1. Verification of CVE Relationship:**
   - The provided content directly references `CVE-2022-20141` within the context of the Android Security Bulletin. This confirms a direct link between the content and the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `ip_check_mc_rcu` function within the Linux kernel's networking stack, specifically related to IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).
   - The `ip_sf_list` (source filter list) of a `pmc` (protocol multicast control) structure is freed within the `ip_mc_del_src` function while under the protection of `pmc->lock`.
   - However, `ip_check_mc_rcu` accesses this `ip_sf_list` without holding the necessary lock, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is the use of a memory region (the `ip_sf_list`) after it has been freed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or system crashes.
   - **Missing Lock Protection:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper locking around the access to shared data (specifically the `ip_sf_list`). RCU (Read-Copy-Update) is used in this function but it doesn't protect against the concurrent free operation.
  
**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Exploitation can lead to a kernel panic, as demonstrated in the provided crash log. It mentions "Kernel panic - not syncing: panic\_on\_warn set ...".
   - More broadly, a use-after-free vulnerability in the kernel can lead to remote code execution, denial of service (DoS), or elevation of privilege (EoP). The provided information classifies it as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) in the security bulletin, suggesting a local privilege escalation is possible.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The vulnerability is related to IGMP processing, which is a core networking functionality used for multicast group management. 
   - An attacker would likely need to craft specific network packets involving IGMP that trigger the vulnerable code path, causing the `ip_sf_list` to be freed while `ip_check_mc_rcu` is using it.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker would likely need to be on the same network as the target device, with the ability to send specially crafted network packets.
   - Given it is classified as EoP, a local attacker with some initial access to the device would be able to exploit this.

**Additional Information:**
   - The patch for this vulnerability adds a lock (`ip_mc_list` lock) in `ip_check_mc_rcu` to protect access to the `ip_sf_list` during the concurrent operations.
   - The provided commit message identifies the bug as `23d2b94043ca8835bd1e67749020e839f396a1c2` from the upstream kernel, meaning the fix is already in the Linux kernel.
   - The Android Security Bulletin states that devices with the 2022-06-05 security patch level or later are protected against this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2022-20141 is a critical kernel vulnerability due to a use-after-free in IGMP processing, triggered by lack of proper locking, potentially leading to a kernel panic or local EoP. The attacker needs network access to send crafted IGMP packets or already be present on the system with some access.
