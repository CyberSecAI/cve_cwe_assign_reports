## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1238:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the NE (New Executable) binary parser within the `r_bin_ne_get_entrypoints` function. Specifically, the code reads the segment number `segnum` from the entry table and uses it as an index into `bin->segment_entries`. The code does not validate that `segnum` is within the bounds of `segment_entries`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code accesses `bin->segment_entries` using an index derived from the binary input without proper validation. This allows reading memory beyond the allocated bounds of the `segment_entries` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault: The out-of-bounds read leads to a segmentation fault (crash), as it attempts to access memory outside of the allocated region. This can lead to denial of service.
- Potential information disclosure: Although not explicitly stated, an attacker controlling the value of `segnum` could theoretically read arbitrary memory if the out-of-bounds read doesn't crash the application directly and is used in subsequent computations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted NE binary file: The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted NE binary file that contains a `segnum` value that leads to an out-of-bounds access when indexing into `bin->segment_entries`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application (radare2 in this case) with a malicious NE binary file.
