# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-34568

## Vulnerability Description
SDL v1.2 was discovered to contain a **use-after-free** via the XFree function at /src/video/x11/SDL_x11yuv.c.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** SDL
- **version:** v1.2
- **component:** XFree function at /src/video/x11/SDL_x11yuv.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `SDL_x11yuv.c` file, specifically within the `X11_CreateYUVOverlay` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The `XFree(hwdata->image)` function call frees the memory associated with `hwdata->image`. Subsequently, a line tries to read `hwdata->image->pitches[0]` leading to the use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The GitHub advisory indicates a high severity vulnerability due to the use-after-free, which can potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory states the worst case could result in arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, indicating that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges and no user interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs because the `XFree(hwdata->image)` call is made before accessing members of the same struct leading to a use-after-free.
- The fix involves moving `XFree(hwdata->image)` call after using the `hwdata->image->pitches[0]` value.
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `src/video/x11/SDL_x11yuv.c` within the `X11_CreateYUVOverlay` function.

```c
if ( hwdata->image != NULL && hwdata->image->pitches[0] != (width*bpp) ) {
    /* Ajust overlay width according to pitch */
    XFree(hwdata->image);
    width = hwdata->image->pitches[0] / bpp;
    hwdata->image = SDL_NAME(XvCreateImage)(GFX_Display, xv_port, format,
                                            0, width, height);
}
```
