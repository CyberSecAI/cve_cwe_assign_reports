## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.6
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that Arm products "do not properly consider the effect of exceptions on a VLLDM instruction." This aligns with CWE-754 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions), as the vulnerability arises from the system's failure to adequately handle exceptions during the execution of a specific instruction. The impact, where "a Non-secure handler may have read or write access to part of a Secure context," reinforces this by highlighting a security breach stemming from mishandled exceptions. Since the description is at a higher level and doesn't provide specifics on how the exceptional condition is mishandled, CWE-754 is selected, noting that more specific child CWEs might exist with further details. The MITRE mapping guidance is "Allowed-with-Review," suggesting a possibility of more specific entries.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-754 is a Class-level CWE, and it has potential child CWEs that could be more specific if more details were available. Given the limited details in the description, it is difficult to pinpoint a more specific CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium evidence based on the vulnerability description and the general nature of the failure.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is considered a secondary candidate because it's a closely related Class-level CWE that describes a product's failure to handle exceptional conditions correctly. Given that the root cause involves the "effect of exceptions" during the execution of a VLLDM instruction, this CWE is relevant. However, since CWE-754 is slightly broader and the description doesn't clearly specify that the handling is incorrect (vs. a missing check), CWE-755 is ranked lower. The MITRE mapping guidance is "Discouraged" because it's a Class-level CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-755 is a Class-level CWE and is related to CWE-754 as they both deal with exception handling.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.4 (Lower confidence as it's a closely related alternative but less directly supported by the evidence.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is another potential candidate as it describes issues related to anticipating or handling rare exceptional conditions. While relevant to exception handling, it is a Pillar-level CWE, making it very broad. The evidence does not strongly support this particular CWE over the more specific CWE-754. The MITRE mapping guidance is "Discouraged" due to its extremely high-level nature.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-703 is a Pillar-level CWE and is a very broad category.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.3 (Low confidence because it's a very high-level CWE and not as directly supported by the evidence compared to CWE-754.)

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-41151** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151): SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked for writing but the server tries to send an error
- **[REF-1374]** [https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards): Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)
- **CVE-2021-3011** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3011](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3011): virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid value to a register, which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code
- **CVE-2008-4302** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4302](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4302): Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0668**: In apusys, there is a possible memory corruption due to incorrect error handling. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05670521; Issue ID: ALPS05670521.
- **CVE-2021-38003**: Inappropriate implementation in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 95.0.4638.69 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.
- **CVE-2021-28165**: In Eclipse Jetty 7.2.2 to 9.4.38, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.1, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.1, CPU usage can reach 100% upon receiving a large invalid TLS frame.
- **CVE-2021-0297**: A vulnerability in the processing of TCP MD5 authentication in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a BGP or LDP session configured with MD5 authentication to succeed, even if the peer does not have TCP MD5 authentication enabled. This could lead to untrusted or unauthorized sessions being established, resulting in an impact on confidentiality or stability of the network. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.3R2-S1-EVO; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO. Juniper Networks Junos OS is not affected by this issue.
