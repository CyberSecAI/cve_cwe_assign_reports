# Critic Input for CVE-2022-21708



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a **bug in the library** that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause **stack overflow** panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause **stack overflow**s. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **bug in the library**
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** specifically designed queries
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** graphql-go
- **version:** prior to 1.3.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a bug in the `graphql-go` library's handling of the `MaxDepth` schema option, specifically when processing fragment spreads. This bug allows crafted GraphQL queries to bypass the intended maximum depth check, leading to stack overflow panics due to excessive recursion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Depth Calculation:** The `MaxDepth` validation logic fails to properly track and prevent recursion through fragment spreads, particularly in cases involving circular dependencies between fragments.
- **Lack of Cycle Detection:** The original implementation lacked a mechanism to detect and prevent infinite loops caused by circular fragment references, leading to unbounded recursion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can send specially designed queries that exploit this vulnerability, causing stack overflow panics. This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive, disrupting its ability to serve data to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GraphQL Endpoint Access:** Attackers need access to the GraphQL endpoint to send the malicious queries. This could be an internal user or an external user if the endpoint is exposed.
- **Crafted Queries:** Attackers must craft specific GraphQL queries that contain circular fragment definitions or nested fragments designed to bypass the depth check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send GraphQL Queries:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests containing GraphQL queries to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of GraphQL and Fragments:** The attacker needs some understanding of GraphQL syntax, especially how fragment definitions and spreads work, to construct malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability only exists when the `graphql.MaxDepth` option is used in the GraphQL schema.
- The fix introduces a `visited` map to track visited fragment definitions during depth validation to prevent infinite loops in fragment processing.
- The fix also introduces new tests to confirm that the MaxDepth validation works correctly with fragment spreads.
- Disabling `graphql.MaxDepth` is a workaround, but it can open other potential attack vectors.

The commit `eae31ca` addresses the vulnerability by fixing the bug in fragment spread logic within the maxDepth validation, and includes added tests to ensure that the logic works as expected.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that a **stack overflow** occurs due to a **bug in the library**. The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause **stack overflow** panics by sending specifically designed queries, which directly aligns with CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is due to the incorrect depth calculation of the MaxDepth option, which allows crafted queries to bypass the intended depth check leading to excessive recursion. CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, however, given the direct description of uncontrolled recursion leading to a stack overflow, it is a reasonable match despite the guidance suggesting to look for a Base-level CWE.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE. There are no direct relationships listed, but uncontrolled recursion can lead to resource exhaustion.

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is considered as a secondary candidate because the **stack overflow** is a consequence of uncontrolled resource allocation, specifically stack space. The vulnerability description notes the attacker can cause **stack overflow** panics. The Retriever Results show that CWE-770 is a Base level, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The relationship between uncontrolled recursion and resource exhaustion makes CWE-770 a plausible secondary mapping.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships listed for CWE-770 in the provided information.

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is considered as a secondary candidate because the stack overflow can be thought of as excessive memory allocation on the stack. The vulnerability description refers to specifically designed queries causing **stack overflow**s.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-789 is a variant of improper resource management.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence based on the description of stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion.)

- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.



## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ParentOf -> CWE-1325
CanFollow -> CWE-20
ParentOf -> CWE-774
ParentOf -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Clearly specify the minimum and maximum expectations for capabilities, and dictate which behaviors are acceptable when resource allocation reaches limits.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Limit the amount of resources that are accessible to unprivileged users. Set per-user limits for resources. Allow the system administrator to define these limits. Be careful to avoid CWE-410.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place, and it will help the administrator to identify who is committing the abuse. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476
CanFollow -> CWE-1284
CanFollow -> CWE-129

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Perform adequate input validation against any value that influences the amount of memory that is allocated. Define an appropriate strategy for handling requests that exceed the limit, and consider supporting a configuration option so that the administrator can extend the amount of memory to be used if necessary.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Operation
- **Description:** Run your program using system-provided resource limits for memory. This might still cause the program to crash or exit, but the impact to the rest of the system will be minimized.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
