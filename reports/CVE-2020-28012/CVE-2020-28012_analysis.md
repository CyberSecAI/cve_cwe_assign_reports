# Analysis for CVE-2020-28012

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-403 | Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | The primary weakness is the **exposure of file descriptor to unintended control sphere**. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.4 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate: The resource (file descriptor) is exposed to the wrong control sphere, but CWE-403 is more specific. |
| CWE-250 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate: The process executes at a higher privilege level than necessary, exacerbating the impact. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly state the **exposure of a file descriptor to an unintended control sphere** due to the missing close-on-exec flag. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-403 "Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')". The root cause lies in the failure to properly manage file descriptors, allowing an unprivileged process to access a privileged pipe. The impact is local privilege escalation, as the attacker can write crafted data to the pipe and overwrite system files. CWE-403 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-403 indicates this is ALLOWED. While CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a related Class-level CWE, CWE-403 provides a more specific description of the weakness. CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) is another possible weakness because the Exim process is running with root privileges. However, the core issue is the file descriptor leak, making CWE-403 the primary weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-403 has no direct relationships defined in the provided information. However, in a broader context, it can be considered related to resource management and privilege management. The vulnerability chain involves the missing close-on-exec flag (CWE-403) leading to a controlled memory corruption and local privilege escalation."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to explicit mention of the **exposure of the file descriptor** and detailed technical analysis).
