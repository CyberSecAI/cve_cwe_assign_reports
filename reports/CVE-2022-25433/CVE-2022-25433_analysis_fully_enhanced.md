# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack overflow** via the urls parameter in the saveparentcontrolinfo function". CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly matches this description. It is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The description lacks details to specify a more precise CWE, so CWE-121 is the most accurate choice.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 does not have any direct relationships in the provided information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with the vulnerability description)
