# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-23537

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is a **buffer overread** which occurs when parsing a specially crafted STUN message with an unknown attribute. The provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states that the **root cause** is a **buffer over-read** in the STUN message decoder due to the code not correctly validating the length of the attribute value. This leads to reading beyond the allocated buffer. Therefore, CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is the primary weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-126 indicates this is ALLOWED. The code's failure to validate the length of the attribute value also suggests CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) as a secondary weakness, because the code doesn't properly validate the size or length of the input STUN message attribute.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a Variant of the Class CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 is a Base level weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
