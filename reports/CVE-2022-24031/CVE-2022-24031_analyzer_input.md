# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-24031

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in NvmExpressDxe in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.1 through 5.5. An **SMM memory corruption** vulnerability allows an attacker to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **SMM memory corruption**
- **impact:** escalating privileges to SMM
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Insyde InsydeH2O
- **component:** NvmExpressDxe

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-24031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an SMM (System Management Mode) memory corruption issue found in the NvmExpressDxe driver within InsydeH2O firmware. This allows an attacker to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM (System Management RAM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SMM memory corruption.
- Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-787).
- Untrusted Pointer Dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the escalation of privileges to SMM, which is a highly privileged mode, potentially allowing for complete system control.
-  Impact includes: disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system and potentially have high privileges to trigger the vulnerable code path in SMM.
- The attacker requires local access and high privileges on the target machine.

**Additional details from Siemens advisory (SSA-306654):**

- The Siemens advisory provides a more detailed description of the root cause of the issue as an SMM memory corruption vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered within the NvmExpressDxe driver in InsydeH2O firmware versions 5.1 through 5.5.
- Siemens indicates a CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 8.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C) for this vulnerability, which is different from the score mentioned in the NetApp advisory.
- Siemens also classifies this vulnerability under CWE-787, which relates to out-of-bounds writes.

**Additional details from Insyde advisory (Insyde Security Advisory 2022015):**
- Insyde confirms that this CVE affects the NvmExpressDxe driver.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Binarly efiXplorer team.
- Insyde provides the fixed versions for the kernel affected by this vulnerability (Kernel 5.1: 05.16.42, Kernel 5.2: 05.26.42, Kernel 5.3: 05.35.42, Kernel 5.4: 05.43.42, Kernel 5.5: 05.51.42).
