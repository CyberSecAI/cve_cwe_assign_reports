### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Incorrect Access Control**
- **impact:** access administrator console
- **product:** zzcms
- **version:** less than or equal to 2019
- **component:** admin.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flawed authentication mechanism in the `admin/admin.php` file of the zzcms application. After authentication fails, the page uses JavaScript to redirect to the login page, but the script doesn't halt execution immediately.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Redirection:** The primary weakness is using client-side JavaScript for redirection after a failed authentication attempt.
- **Lack of Server-Side Enforcement:** The application does not properly terminate the script execution after redirection is triggered, which is a server-side enforcement failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Authentication:** By disabling JavaScript in the browser, an attacker can bypass the intended redirection, gaining direct access to the administrator console despite failing the authentication.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This bypass grants unauthorized access to the application's administrator functions and resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the client-side (browser) behavior by disabling JavaScript.
- **Direct Access:** The attacker then directly accesses the administrator console by bypassing the JavaScript redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Application:** The attacker needs to know the application's structure and the specific endpoint that handles administrator authentication (`admin/admin.php`).
- **Browser Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to disable JavaScript in their web browser.
- **Network Access:** Standard network access to the application's web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue report mentions that the administrator authentication code uses a JavaScript redirect after authentication fails, indicating that the server-side script doesn't properly enforce access control.
- The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to administrator privileges by simply disabling javascript on the client side.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability allows direct access to the administrator console by disabling JavaScript, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism. This aligns with the description of CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], where the application fails to adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs. The client-side redirect is intended to prevent unauthorized access, but can be easily bypassed. The **incorrect access control** allows an attacker to directly request and access the admin panel. MITRE guidance marks CWE-425 as ALLOWED for use. While other CWEs such as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) are related, CWE-425 best captures the direct request aspect of the vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships found for CWE-425.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

### Extended Description
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.

### Alternative Terms
forced browsing: The "forced browsing" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.

- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** Apply appropriate access control authorizations for each access to all restricted URLs, scripts or files.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider using MVC based frameworks such as Struts.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.

**[Theoretical]** "Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect.
- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.
