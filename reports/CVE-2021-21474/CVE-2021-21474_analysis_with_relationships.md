# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-328 | Use of Weak Hash | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the SAP HANA Database accepts SAML tokens with MD5 digest. This indicates a **use of a weak hash**, specifically MD5, which is vulnerable to collision attacks. An attacker can manipulate the SAML assertion without invalidating the digital signature due to the weakness of MD5. This directly aligns with CWE-328, "Use of Weak Hash," because MD5 does not meet security expectations for a hash function, as attackers can find collisions. CWE-328 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. While other CWEs such as CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) are also relevant, CWE-328 is more appropriate as it focuses on the general weakness of the hash algorithm used in the signature, rather than specifically focusing on password hashing. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-328 specifies that its usage is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-328 is a Base level CWE. CWE-328 is a parent of CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). Given the vulnerability focuses on the general use of a weak hash (MD5) for signatures, CWE-328 is more fitting.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of MD5 usage and the ability to tamper with signatures)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability also involves the ability to alter a signed SAML assertion in a way that the digest remains the same, effectively spoofing the signature. This points towards CWE-347, "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature". While the **root cause** is the **use of a weak hash**, the direct consequence is the **failure to properly verify the digital signature**, enabling impersonation. However, the primary issue stems from using MD5 and not necessarily from the verification process itself. So, this is added as a secondary candidate. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-347 specifies that its usage is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There is no direct relationship between CWE-328 and CWE-347. CWE-347 highlights a failure in verifying the signature, which is a consequence of the weak hash algorithm used.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence as this is a consequence of the weak hash rather than a direct implementation flaw in the signature verification logic)
