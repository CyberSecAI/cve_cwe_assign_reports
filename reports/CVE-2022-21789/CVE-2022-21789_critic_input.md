## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **race condition** leading to **memory corruption** in audio ipi. This strongly suggests CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**')). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating that the root cause is concurrent execution using a shared resource without proper synchronization. Since a **race condition** is the root cause, CWE-362 is selected as the primary CWE. Although CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, the available information does not allow for a more specific Base-level CWE to be identified, making it an acceptable choice. The use of CWE-362 is "Allowed-with-Review" because it is a Class-level CWE, but the circumstances justify its selection in this case.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-362 is a Class-level weakness. Potential child CWEs are related to specific synchronization failures, but these failures are not explicitly mentioned in the description. The reference to **memory corruption** could lead to CWE-416 or CWE-787 due to the exploitation of the race condition.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability results in **memory corruption**, this could manifest as a Use-After-Free (**CWE-416**) or an Out-of-bounds Write (**CWE-787**). The information isn't precise enough to determine which occurs, so neither can be definitively assigned. CWE-416 is a variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 (Use After Free) can occur due to a race condition if memory is freed by one thread while another thread is still using it. It's a child of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.65 (Moderate evidence from technical description indicating memory corruption)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability results in **memory corruption**, this could manifest as a Use-After-Free (**CWE-416**) or an Out-of-bounds Write (**CWE-787**). The information isn't precise enough to determine which occurs, so neither can be definitively assigned. CWE-787 is a Base, which is a preferred level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) could be a consequence of the race condition, leading to overwriting memory locations. It's a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).
- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.55 (Moderate evidence from technical description indicating memory corruption)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** In languages that support it, use synchronization primitives. Only wrap these around critical code to minimize the impact on performance.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use thread-safe capabilities such as the data access abstraction in Spring.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Minimize the usage of shared resources in order to remove as much complexity as possible from the control flow and to reduce the likelihood of unexpected conditions occurring.


Additionally, this will minimize the amount of synchronization necessary and may even help to reduce the likelihood of a denial of service where an attacker may be able to repeatedly trigger a critical section (CWE-400).




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
