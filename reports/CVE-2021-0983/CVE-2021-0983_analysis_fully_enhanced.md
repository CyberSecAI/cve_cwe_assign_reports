# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-203 | Observable Discrepancy | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-497 | Improper Prevention of Sensitive System Information Access | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states a "possible disclosure of information about installed device/profile owner package name due to **side channel information disclosure**." The core of the weakness lies in the observable behavior of the system revealing sensitive information. CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) directly addresses scenarios where a product's differing behaviors expose security-relevant information. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions "Information Disclosure (ID)" as a weakness, further supporting this classification. While other CWEs such as CWE-497 (Improper Prevention of Sensitive System Information Access) are relevant, CWE-203 better captures the root cause mechanism of the **side channel**. The mapping guidance for CWE-203 indicates that it is ALLOWED for mapping vulnerabilities at the Base level of abstraction.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-203 is a Base-level CWE under the Class CWE-200 (Information Exposure). It has several parent CWEs like CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy), CWE-205 (Observable Behavioral Discrepancy), and CWE-204 (Observable Output Discrepancy). These relationships show that CWE-203 is part of a broader category of observable discrepancies that lead to information exposure.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of **side channel information disclosure** and the direct relevance of CWE-203's description)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-497 (Improper Prevention of Sensitive System Information Access) is considered as a secondary candidate because the description involves sensitive information about installed packages being disclosed. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight information disclosure as the impact. CWE-497 focuses on preventing unauthorized access to system-level information, which aligns with the vulnerability's impact. However, the root cause is better captured by CWE-203 as the disclosure is due to a **side channel**, i.e., observable discrepancies rather than direct unauthorized access. The retriever result also includes CWE-497. The mapping guidance for CWE-497 indicates that it is ALLOWED for mapping vulnerabilities at the Base level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-497 is a Base-level CWE and is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure). The vulnerability could involve a failure to properly protect system-level information which leads to its disclosure.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Moderate confidence because while relevant, the root cause is better explained by CWE-203)



## Known Examples for CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy

- **CVE-2004-0294** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0294](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0294): Bulletin Board displays different error messages when a user exists or not, which makes it easier for remote attackers to identify valid users and conduct a brute force password guessing attack.
- **CVE-2004-0243** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0243](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0243): Operating System, when direct remote login is disabled, displays a different message if the password is correct, which allows remote attackers to guess the password via brute force methods.
- **CVE-2002-0514** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0514](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0514): Product allows remote attackers to determine if a port is being filtered because the response packet TTL is different than the default TTL.
- **CVE-2002-0515** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0515](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0515): Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.
- **CVE-2001-1387** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1387): Product may generate different responses than specified by the administrator, possibly leading to an information leak.
