# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-32543

## Vulnerability Description
An **integer overflow** vulnerability exists in the way ESTsoft Alyac 2.5.8.544 parses OLE files. A specially-crafted OLE file can lead to a **heap buffer overflow** which can result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **vector:** specially-crafted OLE file
- **product:** ESTsoft Alyac
- **version:** 2.5.8.544

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow during heap allocation size calculation, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Integer overflow: A multiplication operation uses a 32-bit variable to store the result, causing an overflow.
    - Heap buffer overflow: Due to the integer overflow, a smaller than required memory buffer is allocated on the heap. Subsequent `memcpy` operations write beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted OLE file needs to be provided to trigger the vulnerability. The application processes this file and triggers the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious OLE file to the vulnerable software (ESTsoft Alyac). User interaction is required since the user needs to scan the file with the application.
