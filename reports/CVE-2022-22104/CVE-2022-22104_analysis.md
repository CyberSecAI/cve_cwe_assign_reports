# Analysis for CVE-2022-22104

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability results in memory corruption. |
| CWE-1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability stems from an **improper check on the messages received**, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights **memory corruption** due to an **improper check on the messages received**. This aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as an insufficient check can lead to writing data outside the intended buffer. Additionally, CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) is considered as the root cause because the **improper check on the messages received** likely involves a failure to properly validate an index, position, or offset, which can lead to the out-of-bounds write. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-787 has a parent relationship with CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1285 is related to validating input, specifically indices and positions, which if not done correctly, can directly lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Based on the description including memory corruption and improper checks, this suggests a high likelihood of CWE-787)
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Based on the description including memory corruption and improper checks, this suggests a medium likelihood of CWE-1285)
