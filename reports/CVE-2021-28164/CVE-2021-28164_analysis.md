| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.70 | Class | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **default compliance mode** in Eclipse Jetty allows requests with URIs containing `%2e` or `%2e%2e` segments to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory, which directly aligns with **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'))**. This is because the `%2e` and `%2e%2e` sequences are used to traverse directories and access files outside the intended restricted directory (the web application's context). The vulnerability allows retrieving files like `web.xml`, thus exposing sensitive information. Therefore, **CWE-22** is the most appropriate primary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the **root_cause** as related to URI decoding and compliance modes allowing these characters, further supporting this selection.
  Additionally, since the successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of the web.xml file, **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is a relevant secondary weakness as the impact is information disclosure.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* **CWE-22** is a child of **CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere)**, but **CWE-22** is more specific and directly related to path traversal. **CWE-22** can also lead to **CWE-200** because successful path traversal can expose sensitive information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of path traversal and access to restricted directories in the vulnerability description and CVE details).
