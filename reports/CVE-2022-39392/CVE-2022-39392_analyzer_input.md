# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-39392

## Vulnerability Description
Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtimes implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtimes default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocators configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimitsmemory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so its expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Storelimiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories**
- **impact:** out of bounds reads and out of bounds writes
- **product:** Wasmtime
- **version:** prior to 2.0.2
- **component:** pooling instance allocator

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-39392.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Wasmtime's pooling instance allocator when configured to allocate a maximum of zero memory pages to WebAssembly instances. In this specific configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not adhere to the compiler's requirements for safe execution of WebAssembly modules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The pooling allocator's configuration failed to create an appropriate virtual memory mapping when `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` is set to zero.
- This allowed out-of-bounds reads and writes to access memory outside the WebAssembly sandbox.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could read or write memory that does not belong to the WebAssembly sandbox.
- This could potentially lead to information disclosure or code execution outside the sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the pooling allocator is enabled, and `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` is set to zero. This is not the default configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers would need to control the configuration of the Wasmtime runtime and enable the pooling allocator with zero memory pages.
- Attackers would need to execute a malicious WebAssembly module that attempts to perform out-of-bounds memory access.
