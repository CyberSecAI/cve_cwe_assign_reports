## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer access with an incorrect length value (CWE-805) within the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of length values when processing MODBUS/TCP packets.
- Buffer access vulnerability (CWE-805).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet to the affected devices, causing the communication function to stop working, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The devices affected are Human-Machine Interfaces (GOT) and Tension Controllers.
- Recovery requires power cycling or resetting the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the network.
- Attackers can send malicious MODBUS/TCP packets to the vulnerable devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected devices.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to craft and send MODBUS/TCP packets.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **Human-Machine Interfaces (GOT):**
    *   **GOT2000 Series:**
        *   GT27 models: Communication driver versions 01.19.000 to 01.38.000
        *   GT25 models: Communication driver versions 01.19.000 to 01.38.000
        *   GT23 models: Communication driver versions 01.19.000 to 01.38.000
        *   GT21 models: Communication driver versions 01.21.000 to 01.39.000
        *   GS21 models: Communication driver versions 01.21.000 to 01.39.000
    *   **GOT SIMPLE Series:**
        *   Versions 1.170C to 1.250L
    *   **GT SoftGOT2000:**
        *   Versions 1.170C to 1.250L

*   **Tension Controller:**
    *   LE7-40GU-L with screen package data for MODBUS/TCP version V1.00

**Mitigation and Countermeasures:**
- Update to the fixed versions of the communication drivers for GOT devices.
    *   GOT2000 Series: 01.39.000 or later (01.40.000 or later for GT21 and GS21)
    *    GOT SIMPLE Series: 1.255R or later
    *   GT SoftGOT2000: Version 1.255R or later
- Update to V1.01 or later for LE7-40GU-L Tension Controller screen package data for MODBUS/TCP
- Use a firewall or VPN when connecting the product to the Internet.
- Restrict access to the product within the LAN, making it inaccessible from untrusted networks and hosts.
- Install antivirus software on computers that can access the product.
