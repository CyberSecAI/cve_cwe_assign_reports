# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-612 | Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.3 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**improper authorization of index containing sensitive information**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this as the root cause and mentions "Insufficient access control on an index that stores sensitive data". CWE-612, "Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information", directly matches this description. The Retriever Results also rank CWE-612 as the top match with a score of 0.6694. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-612 indicates that it is ALLOWED at the Base level of abstraction. While other CWEs like CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) are related, CWE-612 is more specific to the **index** aspect of the vulnerability.
  CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is more general and discouraged to use according to MITRE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-612 does not have direct relationships to other CWEs in the provided data. However, vulnerabilities related to authorization often can lead to privilege escalation or data modification.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-612 description, as well as the high retriever score and ALLOWED mapping guidance.)
