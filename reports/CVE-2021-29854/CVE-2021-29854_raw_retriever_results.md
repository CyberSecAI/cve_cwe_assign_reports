# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-29854

## Query
IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.1.1 and 7.6.1.2 is vulnerable to HTTP header injection, caused by improper validation of input by the HOST headers. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject HTTP HOST header, which will allow the attacker to conduct various attacks against the vulnerable system, including cross-site scripting, cache poisoning or session hijacking. IBM X-Force ID 205680.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: improper input validation
- **weakness**: HTTP header injection
