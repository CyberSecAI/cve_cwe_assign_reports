# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-22428 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-459 | Incomplete Cleanup | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-367 | Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description mentions an **incomplete cleanup** as the **rootcause**, which can lead to authentication bypass. This aligns directly with CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup), where the product fails to properly remove temporary resources after use. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates a **race condition** as the **root cause**. A race condition can often lead to resources not being properly cleaned up, making CWE-459 a suitable primary mapping. Additionally, CWE-367 (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is a potential secondary CWE since the vulnerability summary indicates a race condition is the underlying cause of the incomplete cleanup. The authentication bypass impact suggests that the incomplete cleanup might leave the system in a state where authentication checks can be bypassed. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-459 indicates that this is ALLOWED because it is a base level of abstraction."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-459 doesn't have direct relationships in the provided information. However, it is related to CWE-460 (Improper Cleanup on Thrown Exception) via the ChildOf relationship. CWE-367 (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is a base level CWE related to concurrent access to resources. The graph relationships are not provided for CWE-367 in the retriever results."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (Based on the direct match of incomplete cleanup and the race condition as the cause of the vulnerability)
