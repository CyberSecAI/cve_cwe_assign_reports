## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information in the GUI. Specifically, user passwords (LDAP), RADIUS shared secret, and the Elastic Cloud database password are not properly encrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cleartext storage of sensitive data.
    - Lack of proper obfuscation or encryption for password entry fields within the GUI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive information like LDAP passwords, RADIUS shared secrets, and the Elastic Cloud database password. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and data.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack is performed remotely via the GUI of affected products.
    - Attackers need to be authenticated to access the GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be a remote user with valid credentials to log in to the affected product's GUI.
    - The attacker needs to be able to deobfuscate the password entry fields.
