# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-0268

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') | 0.9 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The **Vulnerability Description** explicitly states "**Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers (HTTP Response Splitting)** weakness". This directly aligns with CWE-113, "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')". The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** confirms this with "**rootcause:** **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers**" and "**weakness:** **HTTP response splitting**". The Retriever Results also list CWE-113 with a high score. CWE-113 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-113 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found, so there's nothing to influence my decision.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0268**: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.
- **CVE-2021-28979**: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.
