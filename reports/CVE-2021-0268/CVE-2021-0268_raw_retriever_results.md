## Query
An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers (HTTP Response Splitting) weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.

## Keyphrases
