| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "Heap **buffer overflow** in ANGLE in Google Chrome". The phrase "**buffer overflow**" is a key indicator. The description also states it can lead to "heap corruption via a crafted HTML page". The **CWE-787** (Out-of-bounds Write) is a base level CWE that accurately describes the **root cause**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further confirms this with the entry: `"root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow in ANGLE."` and `"weaknesses": ["Heap buffer overflow"]`.
  - *Explanation:* While **CWE-787** is the primary **root cause**, **CWE-122** (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) provides more specific context that the overflow occurs in the heap.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE, and CWE-122 is a variant.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)
