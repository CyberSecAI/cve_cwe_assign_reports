```markdown
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **integer overflow**. |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability leads to a **buffer overflow** due to the integer overflow. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states a memory corruption issue in the User Identity Module, triggered by an **integer overflow** leading to a **buffer overflow** when a segment is received via qmi http. This directly aligns with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) as the primary **root cause**, where a calculation results in a value exceeding the maximum representable integer. Subsequently, this **integer overflow** leads to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), because the incorrect calculation of size of memory to allocate can cause less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a **buffer overflow**."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-190 is a base level CWE, and is a parent of CWE-680 (Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow). CWE-190 CanPrecede CWE-119 (Buffer Overflow). CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119, specializing in heap-based overflows. The vulnerability description specifies an **integer overflow** leading directly to a **buffer overflow**, making both CWE-190 and CWE-122 relevant."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **integer overflow** to **buffer overflow**.)
