# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-20201

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in spice in versions before 0.14.92. A DoS tool might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** many renegotiations within a single connection
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** spice
- **version:** before 0.14.92

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20201:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content explicitly mentions CVE-2021-20201 in multiple locations:

*   The commit messages on gitlab.freedesktop.org reference the fix for issue #49 related to "OpenSSL(TLS/SSL) Security DoS Vulnerability - enables client-initiated renegotiation," and "Fixes BZ#1904459". BZ#1904459 is associated with CVE-2021-20201.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2021:1924 specifically lists "spice: Client initiated renegotiation denial of service (CVE-2021-20201)" as a security fix.
*   The bugzilla entries for bugs 1904459 and 1921846 are both linked to CVE-2021-20201, and their summaries mention the vulnerability.
*   Gentoo security advisory GLSA 202208-10 lists CVE-2021-20201 as one of the fixed vulnerabilities in Spice Server.

Therefore, the content is highly relevant to CVE-2021-20201.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of client-initiated renegotiation in the SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments) server when using TLS. The SPICE server was allowing clients to initiate TLS renegotiation which is a resource intensive process for the server and can cause a denial of service.
*   **Weaknesses:** The main weakness is the lack of proper restrictions on client-initiated renegotiation, which allows an attacker to repeatedly trigger this process and consume excessive CPU resources on the server leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, causing the SPICE server to become unresponsive or crash. This impacts the availability of virtual machines that rely on the SPICE display system and prevents users from accessing their virtualized desktops remotely.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. A malicious client can send a stream of requests that trigger TLS renegotiation, exploiting the server's handling of the process.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS connection with the SPICE server. The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   **OpenSSL:** The vulnerability is related to how SPICE uses the OpenSSL library.  The issue arises because OpenSSL, by default, allows client-initiated renegotiation.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves disabling client-initiated renegotiation using OpenSSL API calls.
    *   For OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and earlier, the fix uses the `SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS` flag.
    *   For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and later, the fix uses the `SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION` option.
*   **testssl.sh:** The `testssl.sh` tool was used to detect the vulnerability. The output shows that a server was "VULNERABLE (NOT ok)" to "Secure Client-Initiated Renegotiation," indicating a potential DoS threat.

**4. Additional Details from Content:**

*   The Qualys blog mentions that the issue isn't new but there is a well publicized working exploit, which is a DoS tool developed by THC called "thc-ssl-dos". The tool uses renegotiation to force many expensive cryptographic operations over a single TCP connection.
*   The vulnerability is also known as the TLS Renegotiation DoS attack which has been seen in other products like Apache and Lighttpd.
*  Red Hat's severity rating for this vulnerability was Low.
*  The vulnerability affects various Red Hat products.

**5. Summary:**

CVE-2021-20201 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in SPICE server that arises from allowing client-initiated TLS renegotiation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust the server's CPU resources, making it unavailable. The vulnerability is mitigated by disabling client-initiated renegotiation using specific OpenSSL flags and options.

The provided documents offer a comprehensive view of the vulnerability including its root cause, exploitation mechanism, impact, and mitigation, and therefore provide more detail than a typical CVE description.
