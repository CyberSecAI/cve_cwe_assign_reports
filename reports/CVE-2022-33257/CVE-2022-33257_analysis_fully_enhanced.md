|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **time-of-check time-of-use race condition**, which directly corresponds to CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition). The description states that this race condition leads to **memory corruption**. CWE-367's description aligns perfectly: 'The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.' The 'Usage: Allowed' mapping guidance for CWE-367 further supports this selection. CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is a more general class of weakness, and while applicable, CWE-367 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-367 is chosen as the primary CWE."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-367 is a Base level CWE. Although CWE-362 is a parent (Class) of other race condition related CWEs, CWE-367 is a more specific fit. There are also relationships such as `CANPRECEDE` from CWE-609 (Double-Checked Locking) to CWE-367. Since the description only talks about **time-of-check time-of-use race condition** and no double locking, we don't consider CWE-609."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of TOCTOU race condition)
