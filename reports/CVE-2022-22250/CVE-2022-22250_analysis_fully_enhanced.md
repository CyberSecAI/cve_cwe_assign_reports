# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-22250

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-664 | Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime | 0.5 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**" which leads to "**memory corruption**". The description indicates that a MAC address, learned locally, is later deleted remotely, leading to a crash and reload of the line card due to the **memory corruption**. This suggests that memory is not properly released after its effective lifetime, aligning with CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime). CWE-401 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. Although the description uses the phrase "**Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime**", CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Throughout its Lifetime) is a Pillar level CWE and is therefore discouraged.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-401 is a variant of resource management issues. It's related to improper handling of memory allocation and deallocation, leading to a potential denial-of-service. It doesn't have direct parent-child relationships in the provided data, but it's a specific type of resource management issue.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the description of **memory corruption** due to the lifetime of a MAC address).

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-1000613** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1000613](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1000613): Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2022-22249**: An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When there is a continuous mac move a memory corruption causes one or more FPCs to crash and reboot. These MAC moves can be between two local interfaces or between core/EVPN and local interface. The below error logs can be seen in PFE syslog when this issue happens: xss_event_handler(1071): EA[0:0]_PPE 46.xss[0] ADDR Error. ppe_error_interrupt(4298): EA[0:0]_PPE 46 Errors sync xtxn error xss_event_handler(1071): EA[0:0]_PPE 1.xss[0] ADDR Error. ppe_error_interrupt(4298): EA[0:0]_PPE 1 Errors sync xtxn error xss_event_handler(1071): EA[0:0]_PPE 2.xss[0] ADDR Error. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series: All versions prior to 15.1R7-S13; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S9; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S7, 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2.
- **CVE-2022-22250**: An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In an EVPN-MPLS scenario, if MAC is learned locally on an access interface but later a request to delete is received indicating that the MAC was learnt remotely, this can lead to memory corruption which can result in line card crash and reload. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions 17.3R1 and later versions prior to 19.2R3-S5; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S8; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S3-EVO; 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R1-S1-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 17.3R1.
