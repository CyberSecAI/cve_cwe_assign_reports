# CWE Search Results for CVE-2022-22250

## Query
An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In an EVPN-MPLS scenario, if MAC is learned locally on an access interface but later a request to delete is received indicating that the MAC was learnt remotely, this can lead to memory corruption which can result in line card crash and reload. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions 17.3R1 and later versions prior to 19.2R3-S5 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S8 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S3 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S3-EVO 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R1-S1-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 17.3R1.

### Retriever Score Interpretation
The scores are calculated with a sophisticated methodology that considers multiple factors:

- **Dense Vector Search**: Measures semantic similarity to the vulnerability description (0-1 scale)
- **Property Graph**: Identifies CWEs with relevant structural relationships (0-1 scale)
- **Sparse Retrieval**: Finds exact keyword matches using BM25, normalized to 0-1 scale (original scores capped at 1000)

The combined score is calculated as follows:

1. **Individual Scores**: Each retriever score is normalized to 0-1 scale and weighted according to retriever weights

2. **Quality-Adjusted Consensus Boost**: When multiple retrievers agree on a CWE:
- The boost is scaled by the average confidence score (higher confidence = higher boost)
- Different retriever combinations receive different boost modifiers:
    - Sparse + Dense (more independent signals): +20% boost
    - Sparse + Graph (partially independent): +10% boost  
    - Dense + Graph (more overlap): -10% boost reduction

3. **Relationship Boosting**: CWEs identified by the graph retriever with explicit relationships receive:
- Additional weight to the graph retriever's score
- A relationship bonus based on the number of relevant relationships

4. **Abstraction Level Adjustment**:
- Base CWEs: +30% boost
- Variant CWEs: +20% boost
- Class CWEs: -20% penalty
- Pillar CWEs: -40% penalty

This approach favors CWEs that are identified by multiple independent retrieval methods, and prioritizes those with explicit structural relationships to other CWEs.


### Result Analysis
- **13** CWEs were found by multiple retrievers, indicating stronger relevance.
- The **sparse** retriever found the most relevant CWEs (20).
- The results include a mix of Base and Variant CWEs, providing good coverage at different abstraction levels.

Higher scores indicate stronger relevance. CWEs found by multiple independent retrievers, with explicit relationships, and at appropriate abstraction levels are particularly significant.
