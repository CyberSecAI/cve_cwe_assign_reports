# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-36326 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-757 | Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability allows an attacker to force the use of a less secure algorithm. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: Downgrading to an unencrypted format results in cleartext transmission. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an **SSL strip vulnerability** that leads to a downgrade in communications to an unencrypted format. This directly aligns with CWE-757, Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade'), as the attacker is forcing the system to use a less secure (unencrypted) communication channel. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the root cause is an SSL stripping attack leading to unencrypted communication, potentially exposing sensitive information. CWE-757 is a base-level CWE, and the MITRE mapping guidance indicates its usage is ALLOWED. While CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, is also relevant as a consequence of the downgrade, CWE-757 represents the core **weakness** more accurately.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-757 does not have direct parent-child relationships listed in the provided information. However, it can lead to other vulnerabilities related to information exposure. CWE-319 is a related weakness, representing the direct consequence of the algorithm downgrade.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit description of SSL stripping and algorithm downgrade)
