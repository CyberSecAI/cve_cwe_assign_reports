# Analysis for CVE-2022-21775

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-413 | Improper Resource Locking | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**use after free**" condition due to improper locking in the sched driver. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this, identifying "**Use-after-free**" and "Improper Synchronization" as weaknesses. CWE-416 (Use After Free) directly addresses the **root cause** where memory is accessed after it has been freed. It is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) is a potential contributing factor, as improper locking is cited as the cause of the use-after-free.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant and its parent is CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release). It can be preceded by other weaknesses like CWE-364 (Signal Handler Race Condition) or CWE-1265 (Unintended Reentrant Invocation of Non-reentrant Code Via Nested Calls) or CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence of use-after-free and improper locking from the vulnerability description and CVE reference)
