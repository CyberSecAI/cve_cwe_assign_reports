# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-0646

## Vulnerability Description
A **flaw use after free** in the Linux kernel Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) subsystem was found in the way user triggers cancel_work_sync after the unregister_netdev during removing device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. It is actual from Linux Kernel 5.17-rc1 (when mctp-serial.c introduced) till 5.17-rc5.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **flaw use after free**
- **impact:** crash the system or escalate privileges
- **attacker:** local user
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** 5.17-rc1 to 5.17-rc5
- **component:** Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) subsystem

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0646:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free (UAF) condition in the `mctp-serial` driver of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `cancel_work_sync` function was called after `unregister_netdev`, when the net device pointer was no longer valid. This operation was intended to cancel pending transmit (tx) work upon the unregistering of the network device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a UAF. The `cancel_work_sync` was being called on a freed `dev` pointer, leading to memory corruption.
- **Incorrect resource cleanup:** The transmit work cancellation was being performed too late in the unregistering process after the associated device resources have already been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** According to the NetApp advisory, this vulnerability could lead to a DoS. The UAF could cause the kernel to crash.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The NetApp advisory also states that this vulnerability could lead to sensitive information disclosure or modification of data. While this isn't explicitly described in the provided patch, memory corruption vulnerabilities such as UAFs can be used for such purposes by advanced attackers.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by closing or unloading the affected `mctp-serial` network device.
- This is a local vulnerability, as indicated by the vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` which means it can be exploited through local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability, i.e., they must be able to trigger the network device being closed or unloaded.
- **Low privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges in the system to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional details from provided content:**
- The fix is to move the `cancel_work_sync` to the `ndo_uninit` function, which is called before the net device is unregistered. This ensures that the `dev` pointer remains valid when canceling pending work.
- The vulnerability affects Linux Kernel versions 5.17-rc1 through 5.17-rc5, as stated in the NetApp advisory.
- The NetApp advisory identifies specific affected products.
- The fix is included in a patch from Jeremy Kerr.
- The vulnerability was reported and tested by Luo Likang.

**Summary:**
The CVE-2022-0646 is a use-after-free vulnerability within the Linux kernel's `mctp-serial` driver. The vulnerability is triggered during device uninitialization and results from improper timing of work cancellation. The vulnerability can lead to DoS, and potentially to sensitive information disclosure or data modification. It can be exploited through local access with low privileges.
