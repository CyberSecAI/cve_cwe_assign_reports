A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **returned initial IV instead of last IV**
- **impact:** weaken subsequent encryption and decryption
- **product:** libtpms
- **version:** before 0.8.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of the Initialization Vector (IV) within the `libtpms` library when used with OpenSSL for symmetric encryption/decryption. Specifically, the library was returning the initial IV instead of the last-used IV after a cryptographic operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect IV Handling:** The primary issue is the failure to return the updated IV after a symmetric encryption or decryption operation using OpenSSL.
- **Use of OpenSSL API:** The issue is related to the integration of `libtpms` with OpenSSL and how it retrieves the IV. Older versions of OpenSSL did not provide a direct function to retrieve the IV, leading to the faulty logic in `libtpms`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Confidentiality Loss**: By returning the initial IV instead of the last used IV, subsequent encryption and decryption steps are weakened, potentially allowing an attacker to decrypt data that should have been protected. This leads to a loss of data confidentiality.
- **Decryption Issues**: Data encrypted using a chain of operations may not be decryptable after the fix is applied, due to the change in IV handling. This can lead to data corruption or inaccessibility if not handled properly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Symmetric Cipher Usage:** The vulnerability is triggered when `libtpms` uses symmetric ciphers in conjunction with OpenSSL, particularly AES and TDES.
- **Chained Encryptions:** When data is encrypted using a chain of cryptographic operations, the incorrect IV handling becomes particularly critical, as each step relies on the correct IV from the prior step.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to libtpms**: The attacker would need to have access to an application or system that is utilizing the vulnerable version of `libtpms`.
- **Knowledge of cryptographic operations**: The attacker would need a working knowledge of cryptographic operations including the use of IVs and symmetric ciphers.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The fix involves copying the last-used IV from OpenSSL so that it can be correctly returned to the caller.
- The issue was fixed in `libtpms` versions 0.7.7 and 0.8.2.
- The vulnerability is present in the commonly used integration of `libtpms` with OpenSSL.
- The bug report on Red Hat Bugzilla indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization was affected.

In summary, CVE-2021-3446 is a vulnerability in `libtpms` where the library fails to properly return the last-used IV when using OpenSSL for symmetric encryption, potentially leading to data compromise.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in `libtpms`'s incorrect handling of the Initialization Vector (IV) with OpenSSL, where it returns the initial IV instead of the last IV, weakening encryption. This aligns directly with **CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV))**, which describes the use of insufficiently unpredictable or unique IVs. The **weakness** of **returning the initial IV instead of the last IV** directly causes the **impact** to **weaken subsequent encryption and decryption**. The Retriever Results also rank CWE-1204 as the top candidate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1204 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1204 is a Base level CWE. While CWE-329 (Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode) is a more specific Variant, the description doesn't explicitly state the use of CBC mode, so CWE-1204 is a more appropriate fit.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and Retriever Results)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-329 (Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode) is a Variant that describes predictable IVs with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. While the description mentions symmetric ciphers, it doesn't explicitly state the use of CBC mode. If CBC mode was confirmed, CWE-329 would be more appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-329 is a variant of CWE-1204. Choosing CWE-1204 as the primary CWE and listing CWE-329 as a secondary candidate covers both potential aspects of the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence; CBC mode not explicitly mentioned)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a Class that could apply if the IV handling issue is considered a broken cryptographic practice. However, CWE-1204 is a more specific Base CWE focusing on the IV itself.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-327 is a Class, and the Retriever suggests that a more specific child might be more appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Low evidence; CWE-1204 is more specific)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

### Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-330
ParentOf -> CWE-329

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Different cipher modes have different requirements for their IVs. When choosing and implementing a mode, it is important to understand those requirements in order to keep security guarantees intact. Generally, it is safest to generate a random IV, since it will be both unpredictable and have a very low chance of being non-unique. IVs do not have to be kept secret, so if generating duplicate IVs is a concern, a list of already-used IVs can be kept and checked against. 


 NIST offers recommendations on generation of IVs for modes of which they have approved. These include options for when random IVs are not practical. For CBC, CFB, and OFB, see [REF-1175]; for GCM, see [REF-1178]. 




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-1472:** ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode
- **CVE-2011-3389:** BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random, allowing decryption of HTTPS traffic using a chosen plaintext attack.
- **CVE-2001-0161:** wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic



## CWE-329: Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product generates and uses a predictable initialization Vector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, which causes algorithms to be susceptible to dictionary attacks when they are encrypted under the same key.

### Extended Description


CBC mode eliminates a weakness of Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode by allowing identical plaintext blocks to be encrypted to different ciphertext blocks. This is possible by the XOR-ing of an IV with the initial plaintext block so that every plaintext block in the chain is XOR'd with a different value before encryption. If IVs are reused, then identical plaintexts would be encrypted to identical ciphertexts. However, even if IVs are not identical but are predictable, then they still break the security of CBC mode against Chosen Plaintext Attacks (CPA).


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1204
ChildOf -> CWE-573

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** NIST recommends two methods of generating unpredictable IVs for CBC mode [REF-1172]. The first is to generate the IV randomly. The second method is to encrypt a nonce with the same key and cipher to be used to encrypt the plaintext. In this case the nonce must be unique but can be predictable, since the block cipher will act as a pseudo random permutation.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-5408:** encryption functionality in an authentication framework uses a fixed null IV with CBC mode, allowing attackers to decrypt traffic in applications that use this functionality
- **CVE-2017-17704:** messages for a door-unlocking product use a fixed IV in CBC mode, which is the same after each restart
- **CVE-2017-11133:** application uses AES in CBC mode, but the pseudo-random secret and IV are generated using math.random, which is not cryptographically strong.



## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

When there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.


For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification [REF-1192].


Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.


Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [REF-267]


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Description:** Ensure that the design allows one cryptographic algorithm to be replaced with another in the next generation or version. Where possible, use wrappers to make the interfaces uniform. This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms. With hardware, design the product at the Intellectual Property (IP) level so that one cryptographic algorithm can be replaced with another in the next generation of the hardware product.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys (see CWE-320). If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography itself is irrelevant.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
