# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-338 | Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-331 | Insufficient Entropy | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that Eclipse TinyDTLS uses the `rand` function in the C library, which is a known, **cryptographically weak PRNG**. The CVE reference confirms this, stating TinyDTLS uses the standard library's `rand()` function and that the `server_random` and `client_random` values are derived from this **insecure PRNG**. This aligns precisely with CWE-338 (Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)). The root cause is the usage of the weak PRNG, which allows attackers to decrypt DTLS traffic. CWE-338 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED for this type of vulnerability.
  - The analysis further indicates a secondary weakness: **insufficient entropy** in the seed for the PRNG. The `rand()` function's predictable output is made worse if the initial seed doesn't have enough entropy. While the description doesn't explicitly state the entropy of the seed is low, the fact that the state of `rand()` can be brute-forced in 0.014 seconds suggests the seed also lacks sufficient entropy, making CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy) a reasonable secondary mapping. The report mentions that increasing the seed value width does not resolve the vulnerability. The internal state is still predictable even with a larger initial seed value, which further supports this.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-338 is a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), but CWE-338 is more specific because it focuses on cryptographic contexts. CWE-331 is also a child of CWE-330, representing insufficient entropy for the PRNG.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-34430**: Eclipse TinyDTLS through 0.9-rc1 relies on the rand function in the C library, which makes it easier for remote attackers to compute the master key and then decrypt DTLS traffic.
- **CVE-2021-43799**: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server installs RabbitMQ for internal message passing. In versions of Zulip Server prior to 4.9, the initial installation (until first reboot, or restart of RabbitMQ) does not successfully limit the default ports which RabbitMQ opens; this includes port 25672, the RabbitMQ distribution port, which is used as a management port. RabbitMQ's default "cookie" which protects this port is generated using a weak PRNG, which limits the entropy of the password to at most 36 bits; in practicality, the seed for the randomizer is biased, resulting in approximately 20 bits of entropy. If other firewalls (at the OS or network level) do not protect port 25672, a remote attacker can brute-force the 20 bits of entropy in the "cookie" and leverage it for arbitrary execution of code as the rabbitmq user. They can also read all data which is sent through RabbitMQ, which includes all message traffic sent by users. Version 4.9 contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that firewalls prevent access to ports 5672 and 25672 from outside the Zulip server.
- **CVE-2021-45484**: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 fragment ID generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.
- **CVE-2021-45489**: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 Flow Label generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.
- **CVE-2022-29245**: SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the clientâ€™s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.
