| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **stack overflow** in the `formSetStaticRoute` function of Tenda routers. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a condition where a buffer allocated on the stack is overwritten. The attack vector involves parameters `staticRouteNet`, `staticRouteMask`, and `staticRouteGateway`. This confirms that the overflow occurs on the stack due to the nature of the function and the supplied parameters. CWE-121 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level for mapping.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 doesn't have direct relationships listed in the provided information. However, buffer overflows can often lead to other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution if an attacker can overwrite critical data on the stack.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack overflow" and the details regarding the affected function and parameters.)
