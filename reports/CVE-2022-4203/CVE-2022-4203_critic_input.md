# Critic Input for CVE-2022-4203



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **buffer underflow**
- **impact:** denial of service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-4203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type confusion in the `nc_match_single()` function within OpenSSL's X.509 name constraint checking implementation.
*   The function incorrectly assumes that if a `gen` (General Name) is an OtherName, then the `base` (base constraint) is always an `rfc822Name` constraint. This assumption is not always valid.
*   Specifically, if an end-entity certificate contains an OtherName SAN (Subject Alternative Name) of any type besides `SmtpUtf8Mailbox`, and the CA certificate contains a name constraint of OtherName (of any type), then `nc_email_eai` is invoked. This function incorrectly interprets the `base` OTHERNAME as an `ASN1_IA5STRING`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify the type of the `base` parameter, leading to a misinterpretation of the data it holds.
*   **Read Buffer Overrun:** The type confusion leads to a read buffer overrun during X.509 certificate verification, specifically during name constraint checking. The `nc_email_eai` function attempts to read data from an address as if it were an ASN1_IA5STRING, when it is an arbitrary data that depends on the othername type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The read buffer overrun can result in a crash, which could lead to a denial of service attack.
*   **Potential Memory Disclosure:** Although not confirmed with a working exploit at the time of advisory release, there is a theoretical possibility of disclosing private memory contents (e.g., private keys or sensitive plaintext) due to the memory corruption caused by the buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **TLS Client:** A malicious server can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted certificate to a vulnerable TLS client during connection establishment.
*   **TLS Server:** A malicious client can trigger the vulnerability by connecting to a vulnerable TLS server that requests client authentication and providing a malicious certificate.
*  **Other scenarios** The vulnerability could also be triggered in scenarios that do not involve TLS if a certificate verification is performed with a vulnerable openssl version and a malformed certificate that triggers the type confusion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to present a malicious certificate to a vulnerable OpenSSL instance.
*   For a TLS client, the attacker needs to control the server the client connects to. For a TLS server, the attacker needs to be a client connecting to the server.
*   The malicious certificate needs to have specific properties: it must contain an OtherName SAN that is not `SmtpUtf8Mailbox`, and it must be checked against a CA certificate that has an OtherName type name constraint.
*   The attack occurs after the certificate chain signature verification, so the attacker's certificate needs to be signed by a CA or the application needs to continue the certificate verification despite not having a valid chain to a trusted issuer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to be of "Moderate" severity by OpenSSL but rated as "Critical" by GitHub.
*   The vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.7. Versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.
*   The fix involves correcting the type handling in the `nc_match_single` function.
*   The Gentoo security advisory indicates that OpenSSL versions prior to 3.0.10 are vulnerable.
*   The GitHub advisory for the `openssl-src` crate states that versions >=300.0.0 and <300.0.12 are affected.

In summary, CVE-2022-4203 is a type confusion vulnerability in OpenSSL's name constraint checking, which can lead to a read buffer overrun and potential DoS or memory disclosure. It can be exploited by a malicious server or client with a crafted certificate during TLS connections, or in other scenarios where certificate verification is performed, with a vulnerable openssl library.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **read buffer overrun** can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification. The **rootcause** is a **buffer underflow**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, highlighting a **type confusion** in the `nc_match_single()` function leading to a **read buffer overrun**. The function incorrectly assumes the type of the `base` parameter, resulting in the `nc_email_eai` function attempting to read data from an address as if it were an `ASN1_IA5STRING`, when it is an arbitrary data, depending on the othername type. This directly aligns with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which describes a product reading data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-125 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a Base level CWE. While there are more specific variants like CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), the description doesn't limit the read to just "after the targeted buffer." The description mentions the read could occur due to type confusion, which means CWE-843 (Type Confusion) is also a contributing weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "read buffer overrun" and detailed technical explanation in CVE reference).

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates a **type confusion** in the `nc_match_single()` function. The function incorrectly assumes that if a `gen` (General Name) is an OtherName, then the `base` (base constraint) is always an `rfc822Name` constraint. This aligns with CWE-843 (Type Confusion), which states: "The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type." The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-843 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-843 is a Base level CWE. It contributes to the root cause, but the direct impact is the out-of-bounds read.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence, as type confusion is a prerequisite to the buffer overrun, but is not the direct cause of DoS).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788
CanFollow -> CWE-170

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.



## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.

### Extended Description


When the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type, this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.


While this weakness is frequently associated with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C, it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory location in multiple ways.


This weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example, errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another type, can also contain these issues.


### Alternative Terms
Object Type Confusion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-704
ChildOf -> CWE-704
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

This weakness is possible in any type-unsafe programming language.


**[Research Gap]** 

Type confusion weaknesses have received some attention by applied researchers and major software vendors for C and C++ code. Some publicly-reported vulnerabilities probably have type confusion as a root-cause weakness, but these may be described as "memory corruption" instead.


For other languages, there are very few public reports of type confusion weaknesses. These are probably under-studied. Since many programs rely directly or indirectly on loose typing, a potential "type confusion" behavior might be intentional, possibly requiring more manual analysis.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2010-4577:** Type confusion in CSS sequence leads to out-of-bounds read.
- **CVE-2011-0611:** Size inconsistency allows code execution, first discovered when it was actively exploited in-the-wild.
- **CVE-2010-0258:** Improperly-parsed file containing records of different types leads to code execution when a memory location is interpreted as a different object than intended.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
