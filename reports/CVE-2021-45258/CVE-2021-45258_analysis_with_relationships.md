| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that a **stack overflow** exists in gpac 1.1.0 via the gf_bifs_dec_proto_list function, leading to a segmentation fault and application crash. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further corroborates this by explicitly mentioning a **stack overflow** due to improper handling of data within the `gf_bifs_dec_proto_list()` function. The crash is a direct result of writing beyond the boundaries of a buffer allocated on the stack. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a broader category, CWE-121 is more specific and accurately reflects the **root cause**. The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-121 as a candidate, although not the highest-ranked one. However, the clear and direct evidence of a **stack overflow** makes CWE-121 the most appropriate choice. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). It describes a specific type of buffer overflow where the affected buffer resides on the stack. The relationship analysis confirms that the weakness involves writing beyond the allocated stack memory, leading to a crash.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack overflow" in both the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary)
