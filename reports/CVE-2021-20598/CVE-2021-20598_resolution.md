## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism** (CWE-645). An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by continuously attempting logins with incorrect passwords. This leads to legitimate users being locked out of their accounts, resulting in a denial-of-service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified CWE-645 (**Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism**) as the primary **WEAKNESS**. The vulnerability description explicitly states that there is an "**Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism**," and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by identifying the **ROOTCAUSE** as "**Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism (CWE-645)**".

The relationship analysis confirms that selecting the Base level CWE provides more specificity than using the Class level CWE-287 (**Improper Authentication**).

The high confidence level of 1.0 is justified based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE summary.
