# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-34502

## Vulnerability Description
Radare2 v5.7.0 was discovered to contain a **heap buffer overflow** via the function consume_encoded_name_new at format/wasm/wasm.c. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted binary file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted binary file
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Radare2
- **version:** v5.7.0
- **component:** consume_encoded_name_new at format/wasm/wasm.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-34502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `consume_encoded_name_new` function located in the `format/wasm/wasm.c` file of radare2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a heap buffer overflow. This occurs when the program writes data beyond the allocated boundary of a heap buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit of this vulnerability can cause a Denial of Service. The heap overflow can lead to a crash of the program (radare2), preventing it from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Binary File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted WebAssembly (WASM) binary file. The vulnerability is triggered when radare2 attempts to parse this malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access (User Interaction Required):** An attacker needs to have local access to the system where radare2 is running. The attacker also needs to convince a user to open the malicious WASM binary with the vulnerable version of radare2.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of WASM files specifically due to the way radare2 handles encoded names.
*   The issue was introduced in commit `b0129d7` and fixed by commit `b4ca66f`.
*   The vulnerable code is within the `consume_encoded_name_new` function in `format/wasm/wasm.c`, related to how the WASM binary format is parsed.
*   The provided PoC file had a size of 38 bytes which is enough to trigger the heap overflow.
*   The overflow happens when writing one byte outside the allocated 54-byte region.
*   The vulnerability affects `radare2 v5.7.0`. It has been fixed in version `5.7.2`.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **Severity:** Moderate
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.5
*   **Attack Vector:** Local
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low
*   **Privileges Required:** None
*   **User Interaction:** Required
*   **Scope:** Unchanged
*   **Confidentiality:** None
*   **Integrity:** None
*  **Availability:** High
