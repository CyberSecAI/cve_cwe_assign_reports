# Resolution Input for CVE-2021-38599

## Vulnerability Description
WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of the official binary releases published as GitHub Releases) is used, silently ignores the libsodium encryption key and uploads cleartext backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation because the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity.

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that when WAL-G is built without libsodium, it silently uploads backups in **cleartext**, violating the principle of least surprise. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the application's failure to check for libsodium support, leading to **cleartext** backups. This aligns directly with CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), as the backups are stored in **cleartext** on a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere. The fact that backups are transmitted **cleartext** also makes CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) a secondary candidate. Both CWE-312 and CWE-319 are at the Base level of abstraction and have ALLOWED usage according to MITRE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 and CWE-319 are distinct weaknesses, though related by the lack of encryption. CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is a parent Class of both CWE-312 and CWE-319, but it is discouraged because it is a higher-level class and more specific children are available.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of **cleartext** storage and transmission in both the vulnerability description and CVE details.)

## Criticism
Okay, here's a review of the CWE analysis you provided, focusing on the accuracy and completeness of the mapping based on the full CWE specifications.

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally good and identifies the primary CWEs accurately. The reasoning is sound, and the confidence levels are justified. However, there are a few areas where the mapping could be improved, primarily by considering related weaknesses and the nuances of the specific CWE descriptions.

**Detailed Review:**

*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**

    *   **Mapping:** Correct and well-justified. The vulnerability description clearly states that backups are uploaded as cleartext, directly aligning with CWE-312's description of storing sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.
    *   **Confidence:** Properly set to 0.9.  The high confidence is appropriate given the explicit mention of "cleartext" in the vulnerability description.
    *   **CWE Abstraction Level & Vulnerability Mapping Label:** Correct (Base, Primary, Allowed).  CWE-312 is indeed a Base-level CWE and fits the vulnerability well.
    *   **Mitigations:** The analysis could benefit from mentioning the mitigations provided in the CWE specification, such as encrypting data at rest when storing data in the cloud. While it is a backup context and not necessarily the cloud, this mitigation could be extrapolated to any storage location.

*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**

    *   **Mapping:** Correct and well-justified as a secondary CWE. The transmission of unencrypted backups aligns perfectly with CWE-319's description of transmitting sensitive data in cleartext over a communication channel that can be sniffed.
    *   **Confidence:** Confidence 0.7 is also appropriate, as the primary issue is storage, but the transmission also occurs in cleartext.
    *   **CWE Abstraction Level & Vulnerability Mapping Label:** Correct (Base, Secondary, Allowed).
    *   **Mitigations:** The analysis could benefit from mentioning the mitigations provided in the CWE specification, such as encrypting the data before transmitting it using reliable cryptographic protocols.

*   **Other CWEs to Consider (But Ultimately Not Choose):**

    *   **CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data:** As the analysis correctly points out, while CWE-311 is a parent of CWE-312 and CWE-319, it is discouraged. The analysis's reasoning for avoiding CWE-311 is correct.
    *   **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm:** This is not appropriate here. The core problem isn't the *use* of a broken algorithm, but the *lack* of encryption. If the vulnerability involved a compromised version of libsodium then this CWE might apply.
    *   **CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions:** While *related*, this isn't the most accurate primary mapping. The problem is the lack of encryption itself, not primarily the missing check. The missing check is a *cause* of the lack of encryption, but the *effect* is more accurately captured by CWE-312 and CWE-319.  However, this could be *considered* as a supporting CWE, since the application fails to properly check if libsodium is available. The fix specifically addresses this by adding a check and exiting with an error if libsodium is required but not present.
    *   **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** This CWE is related, but does not directly apply. While the backups *could* contain credentials, the vulnerability is that the backups are stored in cleartext, not that the credentials themselves are insufficiently protected by other means.
    *   **CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value:** The core issue is not failing to check a return value. If WAL-G had called a crypto library function and failed to check its return, then this would be relevant.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Mention Potential Mitigations:**  Explicitly include a brief list of relevant potential mitigations from the CWE specifications for CWE-312 and CWE-319. This adds value to the analysis by suggesting concrete steps that could prevent similar vulnerabilities.
2.  **Add CWE-754 as a Supporting CWE:**  Consider adding CWE-754 as a supporting CWE. Although the primary issue is the lack of encryption (CWE-312 and CWE-319), the *cause* is the improper check for the libsodium support.
3.  **Consider Context:** The analysis does a reasonable job at contextualizing the vulnerability.

**Revised Summary Table (Incorporating Suggestions):**

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed;  See CWE Specification for potential mitigations like encrypting data at rest. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed; See CWE Specification for potential mitigations like encrypting data before transmission. |
| CWE-754 | Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions | 0.4 | Class | Supporting | Allowed-with-Review; Contributes to the root cause by failing to check for libsodium support. |

By incorporating these suggestions, the analysis becomes even more comprehensive and useful for understanding and addressing the vulnerability.
