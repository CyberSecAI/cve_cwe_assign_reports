# Analysis for CVE-2021-26386

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability leads to memory corruption which directly aligns with the description of CWE-787. |
| CWE-1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The root cause indicates **improper input validation** of system calls, suggesting that a malformed system call could lead to out-of-bounds write. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The primary weakness is the potential for **corrupt memory and code execution** due to a **malformed system call**. The CVE reference summary explicitly states that the **root_cause** is a malformed system call and the **weakness** is **improper input validation**. Given that the vulnerability involves writing to memory based on a malformed system call, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most appropriate primary CWE. The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite memory due to an out-of-bounds write. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates this is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). This relationship highlights that the core issue is writing outside the intended memory boundaries. CWE-1285 is related as it explains the root cause of malformed input, which leads to the out-of-bounds write. The graph relationships show CWE-787 can precede CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) because writing out of bounds can corrupt data structures used by memory management, which then leads to issues such as expired pointers."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
