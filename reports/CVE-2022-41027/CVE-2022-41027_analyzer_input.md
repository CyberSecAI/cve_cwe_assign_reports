# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41027

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the vpn schedule name1 WORD name2 WORD policy (failover|backup) description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-41027.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of `sprintf` to construct strings without properly checking the size of the input parameters, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020
- Specifically, the `vpn schedule name1` command is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted network packet to the device that triggers the vulnerable `vpn schedule name1` command

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the command template and its parameters.
- The attacker likely needs to have a privileged access to the `DetranCLI` interface to execute the command.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable command template for CVE-2022-41027 is:
  ```
  vpn schedule name1 WORD name2 WORD policy (failover|backup) description (WORD|null)
  ```
- The following code is reached when the command is executed:
  ```
  sprintf(buff_0x100,"%d<%s<%s<%d<%s",1,*argv,argv[1],based_on_argv[2],argv[3]);
  ```
- The `sprintf` function writes to `buff_0x100`, a stack buffer of size 256 bytes (0x100 in hex) without checking the size of parameters `argv[1]`,`argv[3]`. Therefore, if the size of the combined arguments along with the format string is larger than 256 bytes, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs.
