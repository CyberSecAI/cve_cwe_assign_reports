# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Use after free** in File System API...allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also confirms that the root cause of the vulnerability is a "Use-after-free in the File System API." This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes the condition where a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The CWE-416 is a Variant level of abstraction and the mapping guidance indicates that it is ALLOWED. The description of the vulnerability and the CWE-416 description are very similar, providing high confidence in this mapping. While **heap corruption** is mentioned in the description, it is a consequence of the **use-after-free** vulnerability, making CWE-416 the more accurate root cause.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). Exploiting a use-after-free can lead to other weaknesses.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of "Use after free" in the vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the reference links.)
