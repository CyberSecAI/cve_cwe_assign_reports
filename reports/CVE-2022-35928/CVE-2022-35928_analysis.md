# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.70 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that "**Passwords lengths were not checked before being read**" leading to "**buffer overruns**". This indicates a failure to validate the size or length of the input (password) before processing it, directly corresponding to CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). CWE-1284's description mentions the product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties. This accurately describes the vulnerability. Also, the resulting "**buffer overruns**" can lead to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow).
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 is a Base level CWE. CWE-122 is a Variant of Buffer Overflow, and is a likely outcome of the missing input validation (CWE-1284).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of missing password length checks and resulting buffer overflows.)
