# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-917 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-74 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component | 0.60 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.50 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that "JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints." Also, "An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled." This aligns well with CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')), as the attacker is able to inject special elements into the expression language used by Log4j2, leading to arbitrary code execution. The **improper input validation** is the root cause. CWE-917 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-917 is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-917 does not have any direct relationships. However, CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component) is a parent weakness of many injection flaws, and could be considered since JNDI is being used in configuration which is then output to a logging parameter. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a general class, and while applicable as a root cause, it's less specific than CWE-917.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-29676**: IBM Security Verify (IBM Security Verify Privilege Vault 10.9.66) is vulnerable to link injection. By persuading a victim to click on a specially-crafted URL link, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct various attacks against the vulnerable system, including cross-site scripting, cache poisoning or session hijacking
- **CVE-2021-38458**: A path traversal vulnerability in the Moxa MXview Network Management software Versions 3.x to 3.2.2 may allow an attacker to create or overwrite critical files used to execute code, such as programs or libraries.
- **CVE-2021-21137**: Inappropriate implementation in DevTools in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a remote attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from disk via a crafted HTML page.
- **CVE-2021-27614**: SAP Business One Hana Chef Cookbook, versions - 8.82, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 10.0, used to install SAP Business One on SAP HANA, allows an attacker to inject code that can be executed by the application. An attacker could thereby control the behaviour of the application thereby highly impacting the integrity and availability of the application.
