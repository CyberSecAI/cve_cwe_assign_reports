# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-23148

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-90 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The description explicitly mentions LDAP Injection due to unsanitized input. |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The description indicates the attacker can obtain sensitive information. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the "userLogin parameter in ldap/login.php" is **unsanitized**, leading to **LDAP injection**. This directly aligns with CWE-90, which describes "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')". The description further states that attackers can "obtain sensitive information," suggesting a potential information disclosure, although this is a consequence of the injection rather than the root cause. The retriever results also rank CWE-90 as the most relevant. CWE-90 is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-90 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-90 does not have direct relationships to other CWEs in the provided information. However, it is related to the broader category of injection vulnerabilities (CWE-74).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence; direct match with LDAP Injection description).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the primary issue is LDAP injection (CWE-90), the vulnerability also allows attackers to obtain sensitive information. CWE-201, "Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", could be a secondary candidate because the impact of successful LDAP injection is the exposure of sensitive data. However, this is a consequence, not the primary weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-201 is a base level CWE. The retriever results listed the CWE with a low score.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Low evidence; Information disclosure is a consequence of the injection, not the root cause)



## Known Examples for CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-41232** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41232](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41232): Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)
- **CVE-2005-2301** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2301](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2301): Server does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a DoS and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-23148**: The userLogin parameter in ldap/login.php of rConfig 3.9.5 is unsanitized, allowing attackers to perform a LDAP injection and obtain sensitive information via a crafted POST request.
- **CVE-2021-20574**: IBM Security Identity Manager Adapters 6.0 and 7.0 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and takeover other accounts. IBM X-Force ID: 199252.
- **CVE-2021-3027**: app/views_mod/user/user.py in LibrIT PaSSHport through 2.5 is affected by LDAP Injection. There is an information leak through the crafting of special queries, escaping the provided search filter because user input gets no sanitization.
- **CVE-2021-37933**: An LDAP injection vulnerability in /account/login in Huntflow Enterprise before 3.10.6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote user to modify the logic of an LDAP query and bypass authentication. The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter before using it to construct LDAP queries. An attacker could bypass authentication exploiting this vulnerability by sending login attempts in which there is a valid password but a wildcard character in email parameter.
- **CVE-2021-29156**: ForgeRock OpenAM before 13.5.1 allows LDAP injection via the Webfinger protocol. For example, an unauthenticated attacker can perform character-by-character retrieval of password hashes, or retrieve a session token or a private key.
- **CVE-2021-23335**: All versions of package is-user-valid are vulnerable to LDAP Injection which can lead to either authentication bypass or information exposure.
- **CVE-2020-36144**: Redash 8.0.0 is affected by LDAP Injection. There is an information leak through the crafting of special queries, escaping the provided template since the username included in the search filter lacks sanitization.
- **CVE-2021-41232**: Thunderdome is an open source agile planning poker tool in the theme of Battling for points. In affected versions there is an LDAP injection vulnerability which affects instances with LDAP authentication enabled. The provided username is not properly escaped. This issue has been patched in version 1.16.3. If users are unable to update they should disable the LDAP feature if in use.
