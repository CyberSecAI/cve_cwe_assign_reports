# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-41185

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-41185

## Query
Due to lack of proper memory management, when a victim opens a manipulated Visual Design Stream (.vds, MataiPersistence.dll) file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author - version 9, it is possible that a Remote Code Execution can be triggered when payload forces a stack-based overflow or a re-use of dangling pointer which refers to overwritten space in memory.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: lack of proper memory management
- **weakness**: 'stack-based buffer overflow', 'use-after-free'
