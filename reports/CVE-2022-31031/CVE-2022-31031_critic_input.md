- **attacker:** PJSIP users
- **product:** PJSIP
- **version:** prior to and including 2.12.1
- **component:** pjlib-util/stun_simple API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow that occurs when parsing a STUN message. Specifically, it arises from a missing boundary check when processing STUN attributes within the `pjstun_parse_msg` function in `pjlib-util/stun_simple.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The code iterates through STUN attributes, potentially exceeding the allocated buffer on the stack if the message contains a large number of attributes, or an attribute that has a very long length.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The Gentoo advisory notes that the worst case scenario is arbitrary code execution, but the provided information only directly confirms stack buffer overflow, which may lead to denial of service or other undefined behavior.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The Debian advisories (DLA 3335-1 and DSA 5358-1) note that buffer overflows can be exploited for denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **STUN Message Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted STUN message. This could occur if the application is using a STUN server, or is directly parsing STUN messages using the API.
*  The GitHub advisory notes that PJSIP users who use STUN in their applications, either by setting a STUN server or directly using the `pjlib-util/stun_simple` API, are affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a malicious STUN message to a vulnerable application that is using PJSIP with STUN support enabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is available in commit `450baca` which adds a boundary check to prevent the buffer overflow. The fix also adds a log message to warn the user if the maximum attribute count is reached.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 2.12.1 and earlier of PJSIP.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" in the GitHub Security Advisory and "normal" with remote exploitability by Gentoo.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `pjlib-util/stun_simple.c` file.
*   The affected software includes `ring/jami`, and `asterisk`.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **stack buffer overflow** exists in PJSIP versions prior to and including 2.12.1 when using STUN. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the **root cause** is a **stack buffer overflow (CWE-121)** in the `pjstun_parse_msg` function due to a missing boundary check while processing STUN attributes. The impact includes potential arbitrary code execution and denial of service. This aligns directly with the characteristics of CWE-121, which describes a buffer overflow condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED, reinforcing its suitability. The retriever results also list CWE-121, but other CWEs had higher scores. Even so, since the description and CVE summary explicitly talk about a stack buffer overflow, I'm prioritizing CWE-121.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of a buffer overflow. It does not have any direct relationships listed in the provided information. It's important to distinguish that this is a stack-based overflow, which is a specific type.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the primary weakness is a stack buffer overflow (CWE-121), a contributing factor could be the lack of proper input validation of the STUN message attributes. The vulnerability arises from a missing boundary check when parsing STUN attributes. This missing validation could be represented by CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). The "Quantity" here refers to the size or length of the STUN attributes. If the product does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties, it can lead to a buffer overflow. This makes CWE-1284 a secondary weakness since the STUN message attributes' size is not validated, leading to the stack buffer overflow. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1284 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 is a base level CWE and does not have any direct relationships listed in the provided information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (The vulnerability description and CVE reference materials mention the lack of boundary check, but does not have strong evidence for improper validation.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-789
ParentOf -> CWE-606

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read
