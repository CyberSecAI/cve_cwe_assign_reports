# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-45687

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the raw-cpuid crate before 9.1.1 for Rust. If the serialize feature is used (which is not the the default), a Deserialize operation may lack sufficient validation, leading to memory corruption or a panic.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** memory corruption and panic
- **product:** raw-cpuid crate
- **version:** before 9.1.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of sufficient validation in the `serde::Deserialize` implementations for most structs within the `raw-cpuid` crate when the `serialize` feature is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `Deserialize` implementations do not properly validate the input data during deserialization. This allows for the creation of invalid struct states.
*   **Unsafe Operations:** The `as_string()` methods use `std::str::from_utf8_unchecked()`, which is an unsafe operation that assumes the input byte slice is valid UTF-8. Without proper validation, this can lead to undefined behavior.
*   **Assertion Failures:** Invalid struct states can also trigger panics due to failed assertions within the code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Undefined Behavior:** The use of `std::str::from_utf8_unchecked()` with invalid input data can lead to memory corruption or other undefined behavior.
*   **Denial of Service:** Assertion failures can cause the program to panic and terminate, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Breaking Invariants:** The lack of validation can break expected invariants of the code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Deserialization of malicious data:** An attacker can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, will cause the vulnerabilities to trigger, leading to undefined behavior or denial of service.
*   **Abuse of Serialize Feature**: The vulnerability is triggered by using the `serialize` feature and deserializing data without proper validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide the serialized data that will be deserialized by the application using the vulnerable `raw-cpuid` library with the `serialize` feature enabled.
*   The attacker doesn't necessarily need privileged access to the system; the vulnerability is triggered through the deserialization process, which could occur in various contexts depending on how the library is used.
