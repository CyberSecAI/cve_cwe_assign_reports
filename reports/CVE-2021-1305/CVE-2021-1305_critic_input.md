## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that an authenticated, remote attacker could bypass authorization and modify the configuration, gain access to sensitive information, and view information that they are not authorized to access. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is insufficient authorization checks of user account privileges. This aligns well with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which describes the product not performing an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. While CWE-285 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged, the available information does not point to a more specific Base-level CWE, so CWE-285 is used. Additionally, the impact, which involves unauthorized access to sensitive information such as logs, configurations, and device information is also addressed by CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere), which is listed as a secondary issue."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-285 is a class-level CWE. CWE-497 is a Base level CWE. It is related to information exposure and could result from the authorization bypass. CWE-285 is a parent of many authorization-related CWEs. The lack of specific details prevents selection of a more granular CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

### Extended Description


Network-based products, such as web applications, often run on top of an operating system or similar environment. When the product communicates with outside parties, details about the underlying system are expected to remain hidden, such as path names for data files, other OS users, installed packages, the application environment, etc. This system information may be provided by the product itself, or buried within diagnostic or debugging messages. Debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form an attack plan.


An information exposure occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program through an output stream or logging function that makes it accessible to unauthorized parties. Using other weaknesses, an attacker could cause errors to occur; the response to these errors can reveal detailed system information, along with other impacts. An attacker can use messages that reveal technologies, operating systems, and product versions to tune the attack against known vulnerabilities in these technologies. A product may use diagnostic methods that provide significant implementation details such as stack traces as part of its error handling mechanism.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200
ParentOf -> CWE-214
ParentOf -> CWE-548

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Production applications should never use methods that generate internal details such as stack traces and error messages unless that information is directly committed to a log that is not viewable by the end user. All error message text should be HTML entity encoded before being written to the log file to protect against potential cross-site scripting attacks against the viewer of the logs




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-32638:** Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the product into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce the roles at the appropriate boundaries.


Note that this approach may not protect against horizontal authorization, i.e., it will not protect a user from attacking others with the same role.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that you perform access control checks related to your business logic. These checks may be different than the access control checks that you apply to more generic resources such as files, connections, processes, memory, and database records. For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.
