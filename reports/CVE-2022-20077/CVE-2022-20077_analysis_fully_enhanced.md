|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the root cause is a **race condition** leading to **memory corruption**. CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is a Class-level CWE that directly addresses race conditions arising from improper synchronization when multiple threads concurrently access shared resources. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" also identifies "Race condition" as the root cause and suggests CWE-362 as a weakness. The description indicates that a timing window exists during which a shared resource can be modified by another code sequence, thus leading to **memory corruption**. While CWE-362 is a Class, it is the most appropriate high-level categorization for the **race condition**. Since the root cause is a **race condition** that leads to **memory corruption**, and the CVSS vector string indicates High impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, assigning CWE-362 is justified.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* Although CWE-362 is a Class, it is more appropriate than its children like CWE-366, CWE-367, or CWE-667 because the description does not provide specific details about the type of synchronization failure. CWE-362 can precede weaknesses like CWE-416 (Use After Free) or CWE-119 (Buffer Overflow) if the **race condition** leads to memory being accessed after it has been freed, or if the **race condition** causes an incorrect buffer size calculation.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of a **race condition** and **memory corruption** in the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability results in **memory corruption**, which can potentially lead to a Use-After-Free condition. CWE-416 (Use After Free) occurs when memory is reused or referenced after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior. Since memory corruption is indicated due to a **race condition**, it is possible that the **memory corruption** leads to memory being freed and then accessed again. This condition aligns with CWE-416.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant-level CWE and a child of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). While CWE-416 is a possible consequence of the **race condition**, the primary weakness is the **race condition** itself (CWE-362). Therefore, CWE-416 is a secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate confidence because, although memory corruption is indicated, Use-After-Free is only a potential consequence and is not explicitly stated.)
