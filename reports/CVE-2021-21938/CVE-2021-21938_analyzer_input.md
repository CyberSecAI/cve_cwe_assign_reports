## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one error in the calculation of the bits required for representing the Palette box's NE field within the JPEG 2000 file format. This calculation error leads to a smaller-than-required heap buffer allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow, Off-by-one Error",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Code execution due to writing past the allocated buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted JPEG 2000 file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability."
