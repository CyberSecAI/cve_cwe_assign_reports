# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-23857

## Vulnerability Description
Login with hash The login routine allows the client to log in to the system not by using the password, but by using the hash of the password. Combined with CVE-2021-23858, this allows an attacker to subsequently login to the system.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **login with hash**
- **impact:** login to the system
- **vector:** combined with CVE-2021-23858
- **attacker:** attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The login routine allows authentication using the password hash instead of the actual password. This is further compounded by a separate vulnerability (CVE-2021-23858) that exposes password hashes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of password hash instead of password for authentication (CWE-836)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the standard login process and gain unauthorized access to the system by using a known password hash, which can be obtained from another vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, exploiting the web server of the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to reach the webserver on the affected device and needs to have obtained the password hash through the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23858.
