# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-23857 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-836 | Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **login routine allows authentication using the password hash** instead of the actual password. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-836, "Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating "**Use of password hash instead of password for authentication (CWE-836)**" as one of the weaknesses present. CWE-836 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that the Usage for CWE-836 is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct relationships specified for CWE-836, the nature of using password hashes for authentication can be linked to other weaknesses. In this case, if the hashing algorithm used is weak, it can lead to CWE-916.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (The description explicitly describes the use of a password hash instead of a password which aligns very well with the definition of CWE-836.)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-916, "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", is considered as a secondary candidate. The vulnerability description does not explicitly state that the password hashing algorithm is weak or insufficient. However, given that the system allows login with the hash directly, it raises concerns that the hashing mechanism might not be robust enough to prevent attacks like pre-computation or rainbow table attacks. While the primary issue is using the hash directly, the potential weakness of the hashing algorithm contributes to the overall vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-916 is a child of CWE-328 "Use of Weak Hash", which means that the hashing algorithm may not provide adequate security strength. CWE-916 is also parent of CWE-760 "Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt" and CWE-759 "Missing Salt", these relationships illustrate how weak password hashing algorithms may be vulnerable.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (There isn't direct evidence of a weak hash, but the use of password hashes directly for login suggests the potential for a weak or easily reversible hash.)
