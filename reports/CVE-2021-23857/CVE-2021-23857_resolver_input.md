# Resolution Input for CVE-2021-23857

## Vulnerability Description
Login with hash The login routine allows the client to log in to the system not by using the password, but by using the hash of the password. Combined with CVE-2021-23858, this allows an attacker to subsequently login to the system.

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-836 | Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **login routine allows authentication using the password hash** instead of the actual password. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-836, "Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating "**Use of password hash instead of password for authentication (CWE-836)**" as one of the weaknesses present. CWE-836 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that the Usage for CWE-836 is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct relationships specified for CWE-836, the nature of using password hashes for authentication can be linked to other weaknesses. In this case, if the hashing algorithm used is weak, it can lead to CWE-916.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (The description explicitly describes the use of a password hash instead of a password which aligns very well with the definition of CWE-836.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-916, "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", is considered as a secondary candidate. The vulnerability description does not explicitly state that the password hashing algorithm is weak or insufficient. However, given that the system allows login with the hash directly, it raises concerns that the hashing mechanism might not be robust enough to prevent attacks like pre-computation or rainbow table attacks. While the primary issue is using the hash directly, the potential weakness of the hashing algorithm contributes to the overall vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-916 is a child of CWE-328 "Use of Weak Hash", which means that the hashing algorithm may not provide adequate security strength. CWE-916 is also parent of CWE-760 "Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt" and CWE-759 "Missing Salt", these relationships illustrate how weak password hashing algorithms may be vulnerable.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (There isn't direct evidence of a weak hash, but the use of password hashes directly for login suggests the potential for a weak or easily reversible hash.)

## Criticism
Okay, let's break down this CWE analysis and see how well it aligns with the provided CWE specifications and overall best practices.

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally sound, particularly in identifying CWE-836 as the primary vulnerability. The reasoning is well-articulated, and the confidence score is justified. The inclusion of CWE-916 as a secondary candidate is also reasonable, although the evidence for it is less direct. However, I believe that the CWE-916 could be improved and other CWEs considered.

**Detailed Review:**

**1. CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication**

*   **Confidence Level:** 0.9 - Justified. The analysis clearly states that the system allows login with password hashes directly, which is the defining characteristic of CWE-836.
*   **Abstraction Level:** Base - Correct. CWE-836 is a Base level CWE.
*   **Mapping Guidance:** Allowed - Correct. As per the specification, the Usage is ALLOWED.
*   **Relationship Analysis:** The relationship analysis is good, but could be stronger. It correctly links the vulnerability to a possible CWE-916 if the hashing algorithm is weak.
*   **Mitigation:** The analysis does not include the specific mitigation strategies from the CWE specification. The analysis could be improved by including potential mitigations. Some example mitigations include:

    *   Server-side hashing: Implement server-side hashing, where the server computes the hash of the password before storing it in a database.
    *   Salted hashes: Use salted password hashes, where the server appends a random salt to the password before hashing it.
    *   Key stretching: Use key stretching algorithms, such as bcrypt or PBKDF2, to make it more difficult for attackers to crack password hashes.
*   **Overall:**  A very good mapping.

**2. CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort**

*   **Confidence Level:** 0.7 - Reasonable, but the justification could be refined.  The current reasoning is based on the *possibility* of a weak hash function. While this is a valid concern, a stronger case would require some evidence (even circumstantial) that points to the use of a less-than-ideal hashing algorithm (e.g., reliance on MD5 or SHA1, lack of salting, or unusually fast hash computation).
*   **Abstraction Level:** Base - Correct. CWE-916 is a Base level CWE.
*   **Mapping Guidance:** Allowed - Correct. As per the specification, the Usage is ALLOWED.
*   **Relationship Analysis:** The existing analysis of relationships is good.
*   **Mitigation:** The analysis does not include the specific mitigation strategies from the CWE specification. Including this information would improve the analysis. Specific mitigations include:
    *   Use adaptive hash functions that are designed to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations ("stretching") or the amount of memory required.
    *   When using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly.
*   **Overall:** The mapping to CWE-916 is less definitive. A more concrete indication of a weak or insufficient hashing mechanism would significantly strengthen this mapping.

**Additional CWE Considerations:**

*   **CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt:** If it can be determined that the password hashing mechanism lacks salting, then including this CWE as a co-occurring weakness would be valuable.  This is a Variant-level CWE and aligns well with the scenario where password hashes are directly used for authentication.  The lack of salting significantly increases the risk of rainbow table attacks.
*    **CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt:** If the hashing mechanism uses a salt but that salt is predictable (e.g., a fixed value, username, or other easily guessable data), then this should also be included. This is a Variant-level CWE.
*   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** While a Class-level CWE and discouraged, it might be appropriate in some high-level descriptions. However, CWE-836 is far more specific and preferred.
*   **CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash:**  This is a Base level CWE that is the parent to CWE-916, CWE-759, and CWE-760. Including this CWE would be useful if there was further analysis of the hash algorithm and it could be determined that it was weak.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Strengthen the Justification for CWE-916 (or replace it):** If possible, look for more evidence of a weak or insufficient hashing algorithm to bolster the confidence in the CWE-916 mapping. If no such evidence exists, reconsider the mapping.
2.  **Consider CWE-759/760:** Investigate whether salting is used, and if so, whether the salt is random and unpredictable.  If not, include CWE-759 or CWE-760 as relevant weaknesses.
3.  **Add Mitigations:**  Include the mitigation strategies outlined in the CWE specifications for each identified weakness.  This makes the analysis more actionable.
4.  **Prioritize Specificity:** Focus on the most specific CWEs possible (Base or Variant levels) to provide the most accurate and actionable information.

By incorporating these suggestions, the analysis will be even more robust and valuable.
