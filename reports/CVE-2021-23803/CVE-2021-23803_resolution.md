# Final Resolution for CVE-2021-23803

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.85 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE: The vulnerability allows bypassing `allowFunctions` restrictions by adding control characters, leading to potential code injection. |
| CWE-138 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements | 0.55 | Class | Discouraged | Contributing Factor: The vulnerability involves improper handling of control characters which enables the bypass of function restrictions. |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.55 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Contributing Factor: The vulnerability involves improper escaping/encoding of function names that enables the bypass of function restrictions. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, **CWE-94** (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), is a child of **CWE-74** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). The contributing factors, **CWE-138** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) and **CWE-116** (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output), highlight the specific mechanisms that allow the code injection to occur. These relationships help to understand the progression of the vulnerability from a general lack of neutralization to a specific instance of code injection. The abstraction levels (Base for **CWE-94**, Class for **CWE-138** and **CWE-116**) are appropriate as they reflect the level of specificity of each weakness.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the improper handling of control characters (**CWE-138**) and the lack of proper encoding or escaping (**CWE-116**) in the function names. This allows an attacker to bypass the `allowFunctions` restriction, leading to the injection of arbitrary code (**CWE-94**). The impact is the potential execution of this injected code, which can compromise the system's integrity and availability.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified **CWE-94** as the primary weakness. The criticism provided valuable insights into the contributing factors and the need to explicitly discard **CWE-1336** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine).

The evidence from the vulnerability description supports this classification: "There is a way to bypass allowFunctions that will affect the security of the application. When the template is set to allow/disallow the use of certain functions, adding control characters (x00-x08) after the function will bypass these restrictions." This directly indicates a failure in controlling the generation of code, as the `allowFunctions` mechanism is meant to prevent arbitrary code execution.

**CWE-1336** was considered and discarded because, while relevant to template engines, it focuses more on the *interpretation* of unintended code within template expressions. In contrast, the vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be *generated* and executed due to the bypass.

The relationship analysis confirms that **CWE-94** is the most specific and appropriate classification, as it directly addresses the code injection aspect of the vulnerability. The contributing factors, **CWE-138** and **CWE-116**, highlight the mechanisms that enable the bypass. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, reflecting their roles in the vulnerability chain.
