# Analysis for CVE-2021-23803

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE: The vulnerability allows bypassing `allowFunctions` restrictions by adding control characters, leading to potential code injection. |
| CWE-138 | Improper Neutralization of Control Characters | 0.60 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate: The vulnerability involves improper handling of control characters. |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.60 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: The vulnerability involves encoding or escaping issues. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description highlights a bypass of the `allowFunctions` restriction in the latte template engine by adding control characters after the function name. This allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary PHP functions, aligning with the characteristics of **CWE-94** (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')). The CVE reference summary confirms this root cause, stating that the template engine did not properly sanitize function names, which allowed control characters to bypass restrictions. While **CWE-78** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) and **CWE-79** (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) were identified by the retriever, **CWE-94** is more appropriate because the vulnerability leads to the potential execution of arbitrary code through the template engine. **CWE-1336** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is also a good candidate but **CWE-94** is a more general case of code injection. **CWE-138** (Improper Neutralization of Control Characters) and **CWE-116** (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) are potential contributing factors as the control characters are not properly handled and output isn't correctly encoded/escaped, but they are less specific than **CWE-94**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* **CWE-94** is a child of **CWE-74** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). **CWE-94** can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, potentially impacting system integrity and availability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Good evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, although more specific exploit details would increase confidence). **CWE-94** is marked as `Allowed-with-Review` which suggests to be cautious, but the vulnerability aligns well with this weakness based on the available information.
