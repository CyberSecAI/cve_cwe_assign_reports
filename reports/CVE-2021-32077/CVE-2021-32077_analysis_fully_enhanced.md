# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-202 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that an anonymous user can discover Social Security Numbers (SSN) via a brute-force attack. The **root cause** lies in the lack of proper access controls and the design of the search functionality, allowing sensitive information to be exposed through data queries. The vulnerability allows an attacker to **discover Social Security Number (SSN) values**, which directly aligns with **CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries)**. While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a broader category, CWE-202 is more specific as it highlights the data query aspect. MITRE's mapping guidance marks CWE-202 as ALLOWED, further solidifying its appropriateness. The last four digits of an SSN are the serial number. With other information like date of birth, first and last name, the serial number is the only unpredictable portion of the SSN which can be brute-forced. This enables malicious users to enumerate employee records.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-202 is a Base level CWE which is a child of CWE-1230. There are no direct relationships that dramatically influence the selection in this scenario, but understanding that it falls under the broader category of information exposure is useful.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (Strong alignment between the vulnerability description and CWE characteristics, supported by CVE reference details)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The CVE reference links content summary mentions that the MSOW Solutions software allowed unauthenticated users to query employee records using PII. This points to a **weakness** related to authentication. The system, by allowing anonymous internet users to access and query data without proper authentication, exhibits a **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)**. While not the primary driver of the vulnerability, the absence of authentication is a significant contributing factor. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-306 indicates it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is a Base level CWE and is related to authentication bypass vulnerabilities. It is a child of CWE-287.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Contributing factor, but not the primary root cause. Evidence from CVE reference links.)
