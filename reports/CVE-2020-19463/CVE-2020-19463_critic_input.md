# Critic Input for CVE-2020-19463



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An issue has been found in function vfprintf in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a **stack overflow**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** PDF2JSON
- **version:** 0.70
- **component:** vfprintf function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack overflow in the `vfprintf` function when processing a crafted PDF file. The fuzzer identified that a specific malformed PDF input triggers excessive recursion within the `vfprintf` function calls, which leads to exhausting the stack space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: A classic vulnerability where a program exceeds the stack's memory allocation leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The program crashes due to a segmentation fault, preventing it from processing further requests and making the application unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: A specially crafted PDF file acts as the attack vector. The malformed PDF contains elements causing excessive recursion when parsed by `pdf2json`, triggering the stack overflow in the `vfprintf` call chain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious PDF file as input to the `pdf2json` program. No special privileges are required beyond the ability to execute the vulnerable program with a crafted PDF.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Valgrind output clearly demonstrates the stack overflow and subsequent crash.
- The error messages in the Valgrind output like "Stack overflow in thread #1: can't grow stack to 0xffe801000" point directly to the nature of the vulnerability.
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) further confirms that this behavior is reproducible.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** due to excessive recursion within the `vfprintf` function in PDF2JSON. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, highlighting that a malformed PDF triggers excessive recursion, leading to the stack overflow and subsequent crash. CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion) directly addresses the scenario where a product does not properly control the amount of recursion, consuming excessive resources like the program stack. While other CWEs like CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) might seem relevant, the root cause here is the uncontrolled recursion, making CWE-674 a more accurate representation of the core weakness. The description aligns well with the conditions described in CWE-674, as a malformed PDF input leads to a denial of service due to the excessive recursion. The Valgrind output provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary showing "Stack overflow in thread #1: can't grow stack to 0xffe801000" strongly supports this. According to MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-674 is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW, and the review confirms that no more specific Base-level child is appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE. It does not have direct relationships. However, the graph database shows that excessive recursion might lead to resource exhaustion, and in this specific case, it leads to a stack overflow which causes a denial of service. While a stack overflow is technically a type of buffer overflow, the root cause is the lack of control over recursion, making CWE-674 the primary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to clear description of recursion issue and supporting evidence from CVE reference links)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834
ParentOf -> CWE-776

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Ensure an end condition will be reached under all logic conditions. The end condition may include testing against the depth of recursion and exiting with an error if the recursion goes too deep. The complexity of the end condition contributes to the effectiveness of this action.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Description:** Increase the stack size.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.
