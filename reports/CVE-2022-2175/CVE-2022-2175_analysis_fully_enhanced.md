# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-2175

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.4 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**weakness:** **out-of-bounds read**" in vim/vim prior to version 8.2. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating "A negative value for the command line position can lead to an **out-of-bounds read** when inserting the result of an expression onto the command line." and identifies "**Out-of-bounds read**" as a weakness. This aligns directly with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which describes a condition where "The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer." The suggested Primary CWE Match from the provided information is also CWE-125. The usage for CWE-125 is "Allowed" and the abstraction level is "Base", which is preferred.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-125 is a base level CWE, there isn't a more specific variant that applies here. CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is similar but less precise than CWE-125 as the description does not indicate *where* the read occurs, only that it is out of bounds. The Retriever Results also includes CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error). An off-by-one error could lead to an out-of-bounds read, and thus could be a contributing factor. However, without more information about the coding error, this is only a possible contributing factor, and not the primary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "out-of-bounds read" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary.)

## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
