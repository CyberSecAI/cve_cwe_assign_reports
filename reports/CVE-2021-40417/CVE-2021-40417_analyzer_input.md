# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-40417

## Vulnerability Description
When parsing a file that is submitted to the DPDecoder service as a job, the service will use the combination of decoding parameters that were submitted with the job along with fields that were parsed for the submitted video by the R3D SDK to calculate the size of a heap buffer. Due to an **integer overflow** with regards to this calculation, this can result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap buffer is written to, a **heap-based buffer overflow** will occur. This can result in code execution under the context of the application.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** code execution
- **product:** DPDecoder service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2021-40417.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow during heap buffer size calculation when parsing a video file. The `DPDecoder` service calculates the size of a heap buffer based on decoding parameters and fields parsed by the R3D SDK. An integer overflow in this calculation leads to an undersized buffer being allocated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer overflow (CWE-680) leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
    - Lack of proper size validation before memory allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.
    - The heap-based buffer overflow can overwrite critical memory structures, potentially leading to control over program execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attack, where a specially crafted video file is sent to the `DPDecoder` service via a network socket.
    - The attacker needs to send a "DECODE" command, followed by the path to the malicious video file and other parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to communicate with the `DPDecoder` service over a network socket.
    - Knowledge of the protocol used by the `DPDecoder` service, including how to format the "DECODE" command and parameters.
    - Ability to host a specially crafted video file on a network share accessible by the target.
    - The attacker can also submit the file via an absolute path on a local drive.

The content provides much more detail than the official CVE description, including:

- Detailed code analysis of the vulnerable function.
- Step-by-step explanation of the vulnerability, including the overflow calculation, the allocation process, and the vulnerable `memcpy` operation.
- The vulnerability occurs within the R3D SDK parsing library when handling the R1 header type.
- The service reads parameters and files submitted remotely, which can be used to trigger the vulnerability, including the path of the file to decode over an SMB share.
- Explanation of how to fingerprint the listening port and submit a malicious file, including the usage of a Python PoC.
- The PoC is split into two parts: one to generate the malicious file, and another to submit it to the vulnerable service.
- Details about the crash, including register values and heap information.
