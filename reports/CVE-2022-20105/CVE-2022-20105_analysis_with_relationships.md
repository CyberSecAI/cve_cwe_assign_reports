# Summary
| CWE ID    | CWE Name                                         | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.90       | Variant               | Allowed                         | Allowed                      |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write         | 0.70       | Base                  | Allowed                         | Allowed                       |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" which directly corresponds to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the presence of CWE-121 as the **weakness**. This is a variant level CWE and accurately reflects the specific type of buffer overflow. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also relevant as the mechanism to trigger the overflow is an out-of-bounds write, it's less specific.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-121 is a more specific variant. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a more general weakness that can lead to various impacts, with CWE-121 being the specific instance in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to direct mention of "stack-based buffer overflow" and supporting evidence from the CVE reference). Confidence: 0.70 (CWE-787) is lower because while the vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds write, the description specifically calls out the stack-based buffer overflow.
