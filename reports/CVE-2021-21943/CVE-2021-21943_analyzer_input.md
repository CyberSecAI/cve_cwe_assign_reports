## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the XWD parser due to a missing size check when handling image data. The size of the allocated destination buffer (`dst_buff`) is calculated based on `PixmapWidth` but is not checked against the size of the data to be copied (`BytesPerLine`), which is directly taken from the XWD file, leading to a potential overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a specially crafted XWD file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can provide a malicious XWD file to the vulnerable application.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed XWD file to the affected software.
