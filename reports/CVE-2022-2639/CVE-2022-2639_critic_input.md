# Critic Input for CVE-2022-2639



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An **integer coercion error** was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer coercion error**
- **impact:** crash or potentially escalate privileges
- **vector:** out-of-bounds write access
- **attacker:** local user
- **product:** openvswitch kernel module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2639:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   An integer underflow vulnerability exists within the `reserve_sfa_size()` function in the openvswitch kernel module.
*   The vulnerability occurs when calculating the required size for flow actions. Specifically, when `next_offset` is close to `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` and a new action with `req_size` is added, instead of returning `-EMSGSIZE`, the code allocates `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` bytes, incrementing `actions_len` by `req_size`. This leads to `actions_len` exceeding the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Underflow:** The core issue is an incorrect check for sufficient buffer space before allocating memory for flow actions, which leads to an integer underflow and an out-of-bounds (OOB) write.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The incorrect size calculation causes `reserve_sfa_size()` to allocate a larger buffer size than intended and when subsequent actions are copied, they are written past the end of the allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability, resulting in a system crash due to the out-of-bounds write.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability may also allow a local user to potentially escalate their privileges due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local User:** The attack vector is a local user interacting with the system and the openvswitch module.
*   **Flow Actions:** Exploitation involves crafting a flow with a large number of actions, causing the `reserve_sfa_size()` function to miscalculate the memory requirements for the flow actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Create Flows:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify network flows using the openvswitch module.
*   **Crafted Actions:** They need to be able to craft network flows with a large number of actions to trigger the integer underflow condition.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the Linux Kernel's openvswitch module.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by rearranging the flow action size check, as per the provided commit.
*   The fix is included in Linux kernel version 5.18.
*   Multiple Red Hat errata (RHSA, RHBA) have been released to address this vulnerability in different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **integer coercion error** in the `reserve_sfa_size()` function of the openvswitch kernel module, where a sufficiently large number of actions lead to the function not returning `-EMSGSIZE` as expected, which leads to an out-of-bounds write. The CVE reference summary provides more detail, stating an integer underflow occurs when `next_offset` is close to `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` and a new action with `req_size` is added, the code allocates `MAX_ACTIONS_BUFSIZE` bytes incrementing `actions_len` by `req_size` leading to `actions_len` exceeding the allocated buffer size. This aligns with the description of CWE-191 (Integer Underflow), where the subtraction operation results in a value less than the minimum allowable integer value. The integer underflow leads to incorrect memory allocation, and then an out-of-bounds write. Because the integer operation leads to memory corruption and ultimately an out-of-bounds write, CWE-191 is more specific to the root cause of the vulnerability.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-191 is a Base level CWE and does not have any direct relationships in the provided information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, clearly indicating an integer underflow condition.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability leads to an **out-of-bounds write access**. The incorrect size calculation due to the integer underflow causes `reserve_sfa_size()` to allocate a larger buffer size than intended, and when subsequent actions are copied, they are written past the end of the allocated memory. This directly corresponds to CWE-787 (Write What Where Condition), where the product writes data past the end of the intended buffer. CWE-787 is a common consequence of integer errors that lead to buffer overflows.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* Although related to CWE-191, CWE-787 describes the impact of the integer underflow rather than the root cause.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (The vulnerability description and CVE reference materials clearly indicate an out-of-bounds write is a direct result of the integer underflow.

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* Another possible weakness that could result from the integer underflow and subsequent out-of-bounds write is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). While the primary issue is an out-of-bounds write, reading beyond buffer boundaries is also a potential consequence, especially given the memory corruption caused by the integer underflow.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 can follow CWE-191, where an integer error may cause unexpected memory access.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Reasonable possibility but the description focuses more on the write, making this a secondary consideration.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is related to integer handling issues. Although the detailed analysis points to an integer underflow, the possibility of integer overflow during size calculations cannot be entirely ruled out, hence it is a possible candidate.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a peer of CWE-191, both relating to integer manipulation.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Possible but less likely given the details provided about the integer underflow.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description

**Reasons:**

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
