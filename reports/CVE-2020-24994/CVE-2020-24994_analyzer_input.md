# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-24994

## Vulnerability Description
**Stack overflow** in the parse_tag function in libass/ass_parse.c in libass before 0.15.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or remote code execution via a crafted file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Stack overflow**
- **impact:** ['denial of service', 'remote code execution']
- **vector:** crafted file
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** libass
- **version:** before 0.15.0
- **component:** parse_tag function in libass/ass_parse.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes two distinct stack overflow vulnerabilities in libass, specifically in the `ass_parse.c` file. One is located in `mystrcmp` function at line 77 and the other one is located in `parse_tag` function at line 234. Both of them can be triggered by crafting a malicious input file.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** The issue is located in the `mystrcmp` function at `ass_parse.c:77`.
*   **Weaknesses:** The provided description doesn't give much detail about the root cause. It indicates that a crafted file can trigger a vulnerability in `mystrcmp` function, but it is not clear how.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vectors:** A crafted file with malicious content is the attack vector.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted input file to the vulnerable application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** The issue is located in the `parse_tag` function at `ass_parse.c:234`. This is further triggered by recursive calls to the same function at line 654.
*   **Weaknesses:** Deeply nested tags, specifically `\t()` tags are the cause of this vulnerability as they lead to excessive recursion. The vulnerability is caused due to improper handling of nested tags in the `parse_tags` function.
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability leads to a stack overflow, resulting in denial of service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vectors:** A crafted file containing deeply nested `\t()` tags is the attack vector.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted input file to the vulnerable application to exploit the vulnerability.

The commit `6835731c2fe4164a0c50bc91d12c43b2a2b4e799` addresses the second vulnerability by changing the parsing logic to avoid recursion when handling nested `\t()` tags, effectively preventing the stack overflow. This change is described in the commit message and the associated diffs.

The content related to CVE-2020-24994 is the issue regarding `mystrcmp` at line 77. The stack overflow in `parse_tag` at line 234, is related to a separate vulnerability which is mentioned in issue #422.
