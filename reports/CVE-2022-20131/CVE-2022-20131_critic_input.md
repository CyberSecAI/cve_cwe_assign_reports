|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**out of bounds read** due to a **missing bounds check**" in the `nci_proc_rf_management_ntf` function. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): "The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, describing an "OOBR in `nfc_ncif_proc_ee_discover_req()`" which also indicates an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The **missing bounds check** suggests that the index, position, or offset was not validated, which maps to CWE-1285.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. CWE-1285 is related to the **missing bounds check**. CWE-1285 could precede CWE-125.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The vulnerability description and CVE details strongly support CWE-125)
---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates a "**missing bounds check**". This implies that the software fails to validate the index, position, or offset before accessing the buffer. CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Index, Position, or Offset) is applicable here as the **missing bounds check** directly relates to the improper validation.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1285 is a base CWE, which is preferred. CWE-1285 could precede CWE-125 because the improper validation of index, position or offset can cause out-of-bounds reads.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (While the description mentions **missing bounds check**, the primary issue is the out-of-bounds read, making CWE-1285 a secondary candidate.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. 


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-20
ParentOf -> CWE-129
ParentOf -> CWE-781

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.

To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
