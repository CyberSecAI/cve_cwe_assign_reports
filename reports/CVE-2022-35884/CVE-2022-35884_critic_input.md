## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is a vulnerability report from Cisco Talos detailing four format string injection vulnerabilities in the Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit web interface. Specifically, CVE-2022-35884 is one of the four vulnerabilities described.

**CVE-2022-35884 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a format string injection flaw in the `web_wireless_connect` function of the device's web interface. Specifically, the `ssid_hex` parameter, which is intended to set the Wi-Fi SSID, is used in an `snprintf` function to create an OS command. This command is then passed as the `format` argument to a logging function, `log`, which uses `vsnprintf`. This allows an attacker to control the format string passed to `vsnprintf`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the use of an attacker-controlled string as the format string in `vsnprintf`. This is a classic format string vulnerability (CWE-134).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    *   **Memory Corruption:** By crafting a specific format string, an attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary memory locations.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** By utilizing format specifiers like `%x`, an attacker can leak stack memory, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious format strings might cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably, leading to a denial of service.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP request to the `/action/wirelessConnect` endpoint.
    *   The `ssid_hex` parameter must be included in the request, containing the malicious format string.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface.
    *   The web interface must be enabled. It is disabled by default, but it can be re-enabled using other vulnerabilities.
    *  The attacker must be authenticated to make the request, as the `web_wireless_connect` function is not accessible without a valid session.

**Additional Details:**
*   The report clarifies that the output from this format string injection would only be visible to a physically present attacker who has accessed the device's UART console. This means that while the vulnerability is exploitable via the network, the direct impact (memory corruption/information disclosure) will only be directly seen locally unless some other vulnerability is used to exfiltrate this.

The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, including the exact vulnerable code location, function names, and parameters, as well as examples of how to trigger the vulnerability. It also explicitly mentions the other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-35885, CVE-2022-35886, CVE-2022-35887) and the methods to enable the web interface (TALOS-2022-1552 and TALOS-2022-1553).

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32785**: mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled.
- **CVE-2021-33886**: An improper sanitization of input vulnerability in B.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

### Extended Description


When an attacker can modify an externally-controlled format string, this can lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or data representation problems.


It should be noted that in some circumstances, such as internationalization, the set of format strings is externally controlled by design. If the source of these format strings is trusted (e.g. only contained in library files that are only modifiable by the system administrator), then the external control might not itself pose a vulnerability.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668
CanPrecede -> CWE-123
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Choose a language that is not subject to this flaw.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that all format string functions are passed a static string which cannot be controlled by the user, and that the proper number of arguments are always sent to that function as well. If at all possible, use functions that do not support the %n operator in format strings. [REF-116] [REF-117]

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Build and Compilation
- **Description:** Run compilers and linkers with high warning levels, since they may detect incorrect usage.



### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

This weakness is possible in any programming language that support format strings.


**[Other]** 

While Format String vulnerabilities typically fall under the Buffer Overflow category, technically they are not overflowed buffers. The Format String vulnerability is fairly new (circa 1999) and stems from the fact that there is no realistic way for a function that takes a variable number of arguments to determine just how many arguments were passed in. The most common functions that take a variable number of arguments, including C-runtime functions, are the printf() family of calls. The Format String problem appears in a number of ways. A *printf() call without a format specifier is dangerous and can be exploited. For example, printf(input); is exploitable, while printf(y, input); is not exploitable in that context. The result of the first call, used incorrectly, allows for an attacker to be able to peek at stack memory since the input string will be used as the format specifier. The attacker can stuff the input string with format specifiers and begin reading stack values, since the remaining parameters will be pulled from the stack. Worst case, this improper use may give away enough control to allow an arbitrary value (or values in the case of an exploit program) to be written into the memory of the running program.


Frequently targeted entities are file names, process names, identifiers.


Format string problems are a classic C/C++ issue that are now rare due to the ease of discovery. One main reason format string vulnerabilities can be exploited is due to the %n operator. The %n operator will write the number of characters, which have been printed by the format string therefore far, to the memory pointed to by its argument. Through skilled creation of a format string, a malicious user may use values on the stack to create a write-what-where condition. Once this is achieved, they can execute arbitrary code. Other operators can be used as well; for example, a %9999s operator could also trigger a buffer overflow, or when used in file-formatting functions like fprintf, it can generate a much larger output than intended.


**[Research Gap]** Format string issues are under-studied for languages other than C. Memory or disk consumption, control flow or variable alteration, and data corruption may result from format string exploitation in applications written in other languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1825:** format string in Perl program
