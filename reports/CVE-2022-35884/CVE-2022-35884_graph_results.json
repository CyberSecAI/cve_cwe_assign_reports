A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from format string injection via the `ssid_hex` HTTP parameter, as used within the `/action/wirelessConnect` handler.",
