# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-34484

## Vulnerability Description
The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Thunderbird 91.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of **memory corruption** and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory corruption**
- **product:** Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird
- **version:** < 102, < 91.11, < 102, < 91.11

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-34484:

**Root Cause:**
- Memory safety bugs identified by the Mozilla Fuzzing Team in Firefox 101 and Firefox ESR 91.10.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption issues, specifically, there are references to heap-use-after-free and JavaScript prototype corruption

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption bugs are successfully exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities were found via fuzzing, implying they can be triggered by malformed input. The specific attack vectors aren't detailed in the advisory but imply the possibility of a malicious actor being able to craft content that could trigger the memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to deliver or cause the browser to process malformed input to trigger the memory corruption. This could involve a malicious website, crafted data files, or other methods. It is implied that this would require some skill and effort, as the bugs were discovered via fuzzing.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory indicates that multiple memory safety bugs were fixed under this CVE, referencing bug IDs 1763634 and 1772651 in the bugzilla system. Bug 1772651 is a heap-use-after-free in `mozilla::dom::GetOtherInProcessActor`. Bug 1763634 is an assertion failure related to trusted events.
- The fixes were implemented in Firefox 102 and Firefox ESR 91.11.
- The advisory mentions "we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code."
