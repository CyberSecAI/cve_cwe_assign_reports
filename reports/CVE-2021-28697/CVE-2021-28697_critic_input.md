# Critic Input for CVE-2021-28697



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
grant table v2 status pages may remain accessible after de-allocation Guest get permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **freed pages still retain access**
- **weakness:** **time-of-check time-of-use race condition**
- **vector:** multiple mappings from guest
- **attacker:** guest
- **version:** Xen
- **component:** grant table v2 status pages

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Xen hypervisor does not properly track all mappings of grant table v2 status pages within guest memory. When a guest switches from grant table v2 to v1, these pages are deallocated. However, if the guest has raced to create multiple mappings of these pages, the hypervisor might only be aware of one, leading to a use-after-free condition when the guest retains access to the deallocated pages.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect memory management during grant table v2 to v1 transitions.
- Race condition when a guest attempts to map the same grant table v2 status page to multiple locations in its memory.
- Insufficient tracking by hypervisor of the mappings of these pages within a guest.

Impact of exploitation:
- Privilege escalation: Malicious guest can elevate privileges to that of the host.
- Denial of service (DoS): Malicious guest can cause host or guest to crash.
- Information leaks: Malicious guest can leak sensitive information.

Attack vectors:
- A malicious guest, specifically HVM or PVH guests using grant table v2 interfaces, can exploit the race condition to create multiple mappings of the same grant table v2 status pages. When the guest switches back to v1, the hypervisor frees the page based on its single tracked mapping and the guest can continue to access the freed memory.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to control a guest virtual machine (HVM or PVH) that has the ability to use grant table version 2 interfaces.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the guest virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition related to grant table v2 status page mappings.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that "**freed pages still retain access**" after being deallocated. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explains that the hypervisor does not properly track all mappings of grant table v2 status pages within guest memory. Consequently, when a guest switches from grant table v2 to v1, these pages are deallocated, but the guest may still retain access due to a race condition that creates multiple mappings. This scenario perfectly aligns with **CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup)**, which describes a situation where the product does not properly "clean up" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used. In this case, the resource is the grant table v2 status pages. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-459 states that its Usage is "Allowed," indicating that this is an acceptable mapping.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release), but CWE-459 is more specific because the issue is about not cleaning up temporary resources.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description also includes "**weakness: time-of-check time-of-use race condition**". The description notes "racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations". This highlights a **CWE-367 (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition)** where the state of a resource (the grant table v2 status page) is checked before use (deallocation), but the state changes (multiple mappings) between the check and the use. This can lead to the product performing invalid actions (deallocating a page that's still in use). While the primary issue revolves around incomplete cleanup, the race condition contributes to the vulnerability's exploitability. The usage for CWE-367 is "Allowed".
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-367 describes a race condition. The race condition exists when the guest attempts to map the same grant table v2 status page to multiple locations.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Sufficient evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly "clean up" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Insufficient Cleanup

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ParentOf -> CWE-226
ParentOf -> CWE-460
ParentOf -> CWE-568

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Temporary files and other supporting resources should be deleted/released immediately after they are no longer needed.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for "proper" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.

**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.
- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.
- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.



## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ParentOf -> CWE-363
CanFollow -> CWE-609

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** The most basic advice for TOCTOU vulnerabilities is to not perform a check before the use. This does not resolve the underlying issue of the execution of a function on a resource whose state and identity cannot be assured, but it does help to limit the false sense of security given by the check.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When the file being altered is owned by the current user and group, set the effective gid and uid to that of the current user and group when executing this statement.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Limit the interleaving of operations on files from multiple processes.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

### Extended Description
When a resource is created or allocated, the developer is responsible for properly releasing the resource as well as accounting for all potential paths of expiration or invalidation, such as a set period of time or revocation.

### Alternative Terms
None

ParentOf -> CWE-775

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, languages such as Java, Ruby, and Lisp perform automatic garbage collection that releases memory for objects that have been deallocated.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** It is good practice to be responsible for freeing all resources you allocate and to be consistent with how and where you free memory in a function. If you allocate memory that you intend to free upon completion of the function, you must be sure to free the memory at all exit points for that function including error conditions.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Memory should be allocated/freed using matching functions such as malloc/free, new/delete, and new[]/delete[].



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps memory leaks, asymmetric resource consumption, malformed input errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1127:** Does not shut down named pipe connections if malformed data is sent.
- **CVE-2001-0830:** Sockets not properly closed when attacker repeatedly connects and disconnects from server.
- **CVE-2002-1372:** Chain: Return values of file/socket operations are not checked (CWE-252), allowing resultant consumption of file descriptors (CWE-772).
