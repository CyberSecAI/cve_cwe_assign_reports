# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41018

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no vpn basic protocol (l2tp|pptp) name WORD server WORD username WORD passsword WORD firmwall (on|off) defroute (on|off) localip A.B.C.D command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer without checking the size of the parameters against the buffer size, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted network packet with a vulnerable command to the `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The attacker needs to know the commands that are vulnerable and their format. A high level of privilege is required to exploit this vulnerability."
