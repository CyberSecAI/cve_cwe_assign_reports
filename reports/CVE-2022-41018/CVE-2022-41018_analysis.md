|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**stack-based buffer overflow**" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms that the `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer without size checks, leading to the overflow. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant of a buffer overflow that occurs on the stack, which perfectly matches the description. CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) is a more general case of a buffer overflow. While CWE-120 is present in the Retriever Results with a high score, CWE-121 is more specific and accurately reflects the stack-based nature of the vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of buffer overflow. While not explicitly stated in the provided relationships, it is understood to be a more specific type of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence directly from the vulnerability description and supporting documents)
