# Final Resolution for CVE-2020-6388

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.75 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.60 | Variant | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |
| CWE-129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | 0.40 | Variant | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), where CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119. This confirms that CWE-787 is a specific type of memory bounds violation. The possibility of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) as a secondary issue is supported by the general description of "out of bounds access". The consideration of CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is related to the "heap corruption" aspect of the vulnerability description. The inclusion of CWE-129 is due to the possibility of an improperly validated array index leading to out-of-bounds access.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **out-of-bounds access** in WebAudio, likely caused by an **improper validation of array index (CWE-129)** or a similar issue that could lead to **heap corruption**. This corruption is a result of an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)**, potentially facilitated by reading memory out of bounds (**CWE-125**) to bypass security mitigations. Because the heap is corrupted, the **heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)** could be the root cause of the corruption. The **impact** is a potential for remote attackers to exploit the heap corruption via a crafted HTML page, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description stating "out of bounds access" and "heap corruption." The criticism suggested considering how out-of-bounds writes could occur, such as **Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129)**. The suggestion to remove **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** due to its speculative nature is valid, and I've removed it. Instead, I have included **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** as a stronger candidate given the heap corruption aspect. I've also retained **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)** because the general term "out of bounds access" suggests a possibility of a read. The confidence scores reflect the strength of the evidence supporting each CWE. The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs, ensuring that the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.

The inclusion of **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** is justified because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "heap corruption", but does not mention if it leads to a heap overflow. The inclusion of **CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index)** is because the vulnerability might have originated from an improper array index validation.
