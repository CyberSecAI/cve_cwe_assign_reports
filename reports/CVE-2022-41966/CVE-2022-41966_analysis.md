# Analysis for CVE-2022-41966

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Improper Control of Recursion [CWE Description](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/674.html) | 0.85 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. The description clearly states that the application can be terminated with a stack overflow error due to recursive calls, which directly relates to uncontrolled recursion. |
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data [CWE Description](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) | 0.75 | Base | Secondary | Allowed: The vulnerability arises from deserializing untrusted data, which is then used to trigger the stack overflow. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states that the application is susceptible to a stack overflow due to the manipulation of the processed input stream, which uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation. This aligns directly with CWE-674, Improper Control of Recursion. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this, identifying the **stack overflow** as the core vulnerability caused by recursive hash calculations during the processing of manipulated XML input. Furthermore, because the input stream is untrusted, **deserialization of untrusted data** is an important part of the weakness and must be accounted for in the final CWE selection."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and while more specific Base or Variant CWEs could exist, the description does not provide enough detail to pinpoint a more precise weakness. The vulnerability also involves CWE-502 because it is triggered via the **deserialization of untrusted data**. The **recursion** happens because of how XStream processes the XML data, but it is initiated by the attacker providing malicious XML."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Primary CWE Confidence:* 0.85 (High confidence due to the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-674)
  - *Secondary CWE Confidence:* 0.75 (High confidence, since the attack comes from deserializing untrusted data)
