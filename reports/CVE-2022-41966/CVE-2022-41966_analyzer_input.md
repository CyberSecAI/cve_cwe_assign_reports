# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41966

## Vulnerability Description
XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **stack overflow in XML serialization**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** manipulation of processed input stream
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** XStream
- **version:** prior to 1.4.20

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41966:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from `security.netapp.com_7ef83aa2_20250108_125949.html` directly relates to CVE-2022-41966 and provides a security advisory regarding the vulnerability. It confirms that multiple NetApp products incorporate the affected XStream library.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a stack overflow during the unmarshalling process in XStream versions prior to 1.4.20. This occurs because XStream creates new instances based on type information embedded in the processed input stream. An attacker can manipulate this stream to inject or replace objects, leading to a recursive hash calculation that results in a stack overflow and denial of service.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   -  **Stack Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by recursive hash calculations triggered during the processing of manipulated XML input.
   - **Unsafe Deserialization:** XStream's deserialization process is vulnerable to manipulation, allowing an attacker to control the objects being created and, in turn, triggering the stack overflow.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service by crashing the application due to the stack overflow error. The application becomes unavailable, disrupting its intended function.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network-based Attack:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), as the attacker manipulates the XML input stream processed by vulnerable NetApp products.
   - **Unauthenticated Attack:** The attack does not require prior authentication (PR:N), meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability without having valid credentials.
   - **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N), so the attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely and without tricking a user into performing actions.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker needs the ability to send malicious XML data to a NetApp product utilizing the vulnerable XStream library. No authentication is required.
   - **Data Manipulation:** The attacker must be capable of manipulating the XML stream to inject recursive collection or map objects to trigger the stack overflow during deserialization.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
   - The NetApp advisory states that no NetApp products are affected which is confusing given that the advisory is about this vulnerability in their products. This was likely in error. 
   -  The advisory notes that NetApp is aware of public discussion about this vulnerability.
   - It is also noted that the vulnerability is scored as HIGH with a CVSS score of 7.5
   - The advisory provides a link to the official XStream vulnerability page.
   - The advisory suggests potential workarounds, like catching the StackOverflowError or disabling references, default implementations for Java Map and Set or using a security framework to deny usage of the problematic types.

The content also provides further information from XStream's own page:
   -  XStream versions prior to 1.4.20 are affected, if using the version out of the box.
   - It highlights that an attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects that result in a stack overflow.
   - An example of how to reproduce the attack using XML is provided
   -  It further explains how to address the issue and provides code snippets on how to avoid the vulnerability
   -  The vulnerability was found and reported by Lai Han of nsfocus security team

The content indicates that XStream is a widely used component, and several NetApp products incorporate it, making this a serious vulnerability that can lead to a denial of service.
