- **version:** prior to V
- **component:** Dashboard API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a background service named "steve" within Rancher Desktop. This service, intended for the dashboard's communication, was incorrectly configured to bind to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Network Binding:** The "steve" service was accessible from any machine on the local network because it was bound to all network interfaces.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The API exposed by the "steve" service lacked proper access control, allowing unauthorized access to the dashboard's operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote API Access:** Attackers on the same local network could access the dashboard API through the exposed "steve" service.
*   **Unauthorized Operations:** This access allowed attackers to perform any operations that the dashboard could perform, potentially compromising the user's environment.
*   **High Confidentiality Impact**: Access to the API provides a means to get access to the configuration and settings of the users local kubernetes cluster, which might also include secrets and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any attacker on the same local network as the machine running the vulnerable version of Rancher Desktop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the targeted machine. No special authentication or privileges on the target machine are required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was identified when users reported prompts for network access by "steve" on Windows and macOS systems.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Rancher Desktop version 1.2.1.
*   A workaround involves blocking network access to "steve" completely or restricting access to localhost to ensure the dashboard operates only locally, preventing remote exploitation.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score for this vulnerability was determined to be 7.6 initially, later adjusted to 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L) after considering the network aspect of the attack vector. The access vector was changed from Adjacent to Network after further analysis.
