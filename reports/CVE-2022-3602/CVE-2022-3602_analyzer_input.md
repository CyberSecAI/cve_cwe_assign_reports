# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-3602

## Vulnerability Description
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This **buffer overflow** could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2022-3602 and related CVE-2022-3786:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance:**

*   The content directly relates to CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, as evidenced by multiple sources referencing these CVE IDs. These sources include the official OpenSSL advisory, mailing list discussions, and vendor security advisories from MultiTech, Cisco, and NetApp.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   *   **Root Cause:** Both CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 are caused by buffer overflow vulnerabilities in OpenSSL's processing of email addresses within X.509 certificates, specifically during name constraint checking. These vulnerabilities are present within the punycode decoding functions added in OpenSSL 3.x.

   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
      *   **CVE-2022-3602:** A 4-byte buffer overflow on the stack occurs when parsing a crafted email address in an X.509 certificate.
      *   **CVE-2022-3786:** A variable length buffer overflow on the stack occurs when parsing a crafted email address with a large number of '.' characters in an X.509 certificate.

   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        *   The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash caused by the buffer overflow.
        *   In some situations, remote code execution (RCE) is possible depending on stack layout and other factors specific to the target environment. This is considered less likely.

   *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   In TLS clients, this is triggered by connecting to a malicious server that provides an X.509 certificate with crafted email addresses.
        *   In TLS servers, it is triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects, presenting a certificate with crafted email addresses.
        *   Exploitation occurs after certificate chain signature verification but before the completion of path construction to a trusted issuer. An attacker requires a malicious certificate, which is either signed by a trusted CA or the application has to ignore the invalid certificate path.

    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   An attacker needs the ability to send a specially crafted X.509 certificate that includes the malicious email address either via a TLS handshake (client or server) or via another process that uses certificate verification with email address checking.
        *   The attacker can be either a malicious server sending a crafted certificate to a client, or a malicious client providing such a certificate to a server requiring client authentication.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   **Severity Downgrade:** OpenSSL initially classified CVE-2022-3602 as CRITICAL but downgraded it to HIGH after further analysis that accounted for mitigating factors such as stack overflow protections and compiler/platform differences.
*   **Affected Versions:** These vulnerabilities affect OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.6. OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.
*   **Fix:** OpenSSL 3.0.7 and higher versions have fixed the vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation:** No known working exploits leading to RCE have been publicly identified, and there is no evidence of exploitation as of the release date of the advisories.
*   **Third-Party Impacts:** Multiple vendors, including Cisco, NetApp, MultiTech, and others, have issued advisories and patches for their affected products. The CERT/CC vulnerability note also lists a wide range of affected and not affected products/vendors.
*  **Mitigation in Rust:** There is discussion about how these vulnerabilities could have been avoided by implementing the functionality in a memory-safe language, like Rust, which provides compile time or runtime checks that can prevent buffer overflows.
*   **Fuzzing:** There are indications that fuzzing might have caught these vulnerabilities earlier. It is suggested that the OpenSSL project should revisit its assessment of code quality.

**4. Summary of Relevant Content:**

*   The OpenSSL advisory describes the technical details of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   Mailing list discussions provide context from security researchers about the severity, mitigations, and potential impact of the vulnerabilities.
*   Vendor advisories from Cisco and MultiTech provide specific information about affected products and fixes or mitigations.
*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note provides a comprehensive list of affected and not affected software and vendors.
