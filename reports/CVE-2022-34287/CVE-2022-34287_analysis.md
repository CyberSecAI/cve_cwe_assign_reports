| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**stack corruption** vulnerability while parsing PCB files". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" expands on this, mentioning "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119), leading to stack corruption." CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a Base level CWE that describes writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer, which aligns with the concept of **stack corruption** due to writing outside of allocated stack memory. The mapping guidance for CWE-787 is "Allowed."
  CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant of CWE-787 and describes a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. The vulnerability states "**stack corruption**" so CWE-121 is a good secondary candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level weakness and a parent of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). CWE-787 is also a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), reflecting that out-of-bounds writes are a type of buffer error.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence based on the explicit mention of "stack corruption" and the alignment with CWE-787's definition.)
