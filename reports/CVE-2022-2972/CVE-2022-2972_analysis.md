## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" in MZ Automations libIEC61850. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating "**Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)**: The software is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow." CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE specifically for buffer overflows occurring on the stack. The description aligns directly with CWE-121. The impact includes device crashes and remote code execution, typical consequences of stack-based buffer overflows. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED for stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 describes the general class of buffer overflows, CWE-121 is a more specific variant.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match with vulnerability description and confirmation in CVE reference materials)
