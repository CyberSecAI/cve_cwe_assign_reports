| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Root cause of the vulnerability. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" in Cesanta MJS v2.20.0. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, noting that a heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `snquote` function within `src/mjs_json.c` during JSON stringification. This aligns directly with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a buffer overflow where the buffer being overwritten is allocated in the heap. The attack is triggered by providing a specially crafted JavaScript payload to the `JSON.stringify` function. The impact includes program crashes and potential code execution. The retriever results also identify CWE-122 as a candidate, with a high dense score. CWE-122 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-122 for heap overflows.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a broader category, the specific mention of "heap" allocation makes CWE-122 a more precise classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of heap buffer overflow and supporting CVE details)
