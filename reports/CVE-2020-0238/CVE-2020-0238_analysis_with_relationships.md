# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-0238 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**') | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The primary weakness is a **race condition**. |
| CWE-441 | Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('**Confused Deputy**') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The vulnerability is described as a **confused deputy** attack. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **race condition** as the root cause and a **confused deputy** attack as the weakness. CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (**'Race Condition'**)) accurately describes the **race condition** aspect. CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary (**'Confused Deputy'**)) directly matches the described attack type. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also describes the ability of a third-party to launch arbitrary activities due to improper exported attribute and permission checks, supporting the **confused deputy** aspect. Because both CWEs are class level, they should be reviewed to see if there is a better base level CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-362 is a class-level weakness. CWE-441 is also a class-level weakness. While there are child CWEs of CWE-362, none of them perfectly capture the specific nature of this vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of both the **race condition** and **confused deputy** in the vulnerability description and supporting details in the CVE reference).
