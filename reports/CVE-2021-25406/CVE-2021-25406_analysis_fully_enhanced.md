# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-25406

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.75 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**Information exposure**" vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions "Unauthorized access to device's serial number." and "An attacker can access connected Bluetooth device information." This aligns with CWE-200 which describes a product exposing sensitive information to an actor not authorized to have it. The retriever results show CWE-200 as a candidate, although marked as "Discouraged" because it is a Class level CWE. However, given the information available, this is the most fitting. While more specific Base CWEs might exist, the provided information does not give enough detail to select one.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-200 is a class level CWE, with potential child CWEs providing more specific details. However, without further information about the specific mechanism of information exposure, it's difficult to pinpoint a more specific CWE. CWE-538 (Information Exposure Through Files/Directories) is a child of CWE-200, however, there is no evidence of file or directory exposure.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate confidence due to limited detail in the vulnerability description, but strong alignment with the general concept of information exposure.)

## Known Examples for CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-1999036** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1999036](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1999036): SSH password for private key stored in build log
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1406**: A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper inclusion of sensitive information in downloadable files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a specific set of commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain hashed credentials of system users. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to have valid user credentials with elevated privileges.
- **CVE-2021-39898**: In all versions of GitLab CE/EE since version 10.6, a project export leaks the external webhook token value which may allow access to the project which it was exported from.
- **CVE-2021-36151**: In Apache Gobblin, the Hadoop token is written to a temp file that is visible to all local users on Unix-like systems. This affects versions <= 0.15.0. Users should update to version 0.16.0 which addresses this issue.
- **CVE-2021-40363**: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 (All versions), SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 (All versions), SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1 (All versions < V9.1 SP1), SIMATIC WinCC V15 and earlier (All versions < V15 SP1 Update 7), SIMATIC WinCC V16 (All versions < V16 Update 5), SIMATIC WinCC V17 (All versions < V17 Update 2), SIMATIC WinCC V17 (All versions <= V17 Update 4), SIMATIC WinCC V7.4 (All versions < V7.4 SP1 Update 19), SIMATIC WinCC V7.5 (All versions < V7.5 SP2 Update 6). The affected component stores the credentials of a local system account in a potentially publicly accessible project file using an outdated cipher algorithm. An attacker may use this to brute force the credentials and take over the system.
- **CVE-2022-27195**: Jenkins Parameterized Trigger Plugin 2.43 and earlier captures environment variables passed to builds triggered using Jenkins Parameterized Trigger Plugin, including password parameter values, in their `build.xml` files. These values are stored unencrypted and can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.
- **CVE-2022-0013**: A file information exposure vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent that enables a local attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the system with elevated privileges when generating a support file. This issue impacts: Cortex XDR agent 5.0 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 5.0.12; Cortex XDR agent 6.1 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 6.1.9; Cortex XDR agent 7.2 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 7.2.4; Cortex XDR agent 7.3 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 7.3.2.
- **CVE-2022-24782**: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions 2.8.2 and prior in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `tests-passed` branch are vulnerable to a data leak. Users can request an export of their own activity. Sometimes, due to category settings, they may have category membership for a secure category. The name of this secure category is shown to the user in the export. The same thing occurs when the user's post has been moved to a secure category. A patch for this issue is available in the `main` branch of Discourse's GitHub repository and is anticipated to be part of future releases.
