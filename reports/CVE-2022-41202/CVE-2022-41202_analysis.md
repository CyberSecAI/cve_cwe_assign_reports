# Analysis for CVE-2022-41202

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant |  Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-824 | Access of Pointer After Free | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a "**stack-based overflow**" and "**re-use of dangling pointer**" as the weakness. This strongly suggests CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as the primary CWE. The "**lack of proper memory management**" is the root cause. CWE-824 (Access of Pointer After Free) is selected as a secondary CWE due to the mention of "**re-use of dangling pointer**" which implies a use-after-free condition.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-121 is more specific due to the stack allocation, and thus more appropriate. CWE-824 can lead to out-of-bounds write CWE-787.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence due to explicit mention of "stack-based overflow" and "dangling pointer")
