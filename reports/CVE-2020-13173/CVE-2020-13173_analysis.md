# Analysis for CVE-2020-13173

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-421 | Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves an **insecure named pipe**, which can be viewed as an alternate communication channel accessible to unauthorized actors. |
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.60 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: The **insecure named pipe** can also be viewed as an incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource, allowing unintended access. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights the creation of an **insecure named pipe** in Teradici PCoIP products, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive information or elevate privileges. CWE-421 (Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel) closely matches this scenario because an **insecure named pipe** can be considered an alternate channel accessible to unauthorized actors, creating a race condition during access. The description explicitly mentions the potential for an attacker to intercept sensitive information or elevate privileges, aligning with the risk associated with CWE-421. While CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is also relevant, the concept of an alternate channel makes CWE-421 a more precise fit for the primary weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-421, and it's at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-421 is related to CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) as the **insecure named pipe** can lead to race conditions. It is a child of CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel)."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and retriever results.)
