# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-13173

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-421 | Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves an **insecure named pipe**, which can be viewed as an alternate communication channel accessible to unauthorized actors. |
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.60 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: The **insecure named pipe** can also be viewed as an incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource, allowing unintended access. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights the creation of an **insecure named pipe** in Teradici PCoIP products, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive information or elevate privileges. CWE-421 (Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel) closely matches this scenario because an **insecure named pipe** can be considered an alternate channel accessible to unauthorized actors, creating a race condition during access. The description explicitly mentions the potential for an attacker to intercept sensitive information or elevate privileges, aligning with the risk associated with CWE-421. While CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is also relevant, the concept of an alternate channel makes CWE-421 a more precise fit for the primary weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-421, and it's at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-421 is related to CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) as the **insecure named pipe** can lead to race conditions. It is a child of CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel)."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and retriever results.)

## Known Examples for CWE-421: Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-0351** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-0351](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-0351): FTP "Pizza Thief" vulnerability. Attacker can connect to a port that was intended for use by another client.
- **CVE-2003-0230** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0230](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0230): Product creates Windows named pipe during authentication that another attacker can hijack by connecting to it.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-13173**: Initialization of the pcoip_credential_provider in Teradici PCoIP Standard Agent for Windows and PCoIP Graphics Agent for Windows versions 19.11.1 and earlier creates an insecure named pipe, which allows an attacker to intercept sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges via pre-installing an application which acquires that named pipe.


## Known Examples for CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-8004** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-8004](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-8004): When the internal flash is protected by blocking access on the Data Bus (DBUS), it can still be indirectly accessed through the Instruction Bus (IBUS).
- **CVE-2002-0567** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0567](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0567): DB server assumes that local clients have performed authentication, allowing attacker to directly connect to a process to load libraries and execute commands; a socket interface also exists (another alternate channel), so attack can be remote.
- **CVE-2002-1578** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1578](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1578): Product does not restrict access to underlying database, so attacker can bypass restrictions by directly querying the database.
- **CVE-2003-1035** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1035](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1035): User can avoid lockouts by using an API instead of the GUI to conduct brute force password guessing.
- **CVE-2002-1863** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1863](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1863): FTP service can not be disabled even when other access controls would require it.
- **CVE-2002-0066** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0066](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0066): Windows named pipe created without authentication/access control, allowing configuration modification.
- **CVE-2004-1461** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1461](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1461): Router management interface spawns a separate TCP connection after authentication, allowing hijacking by attacker coming from the same IP address.
