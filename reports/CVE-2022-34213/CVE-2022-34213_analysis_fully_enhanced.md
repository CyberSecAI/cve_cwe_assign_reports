|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-260 | Password in Configuration File | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Jenkins plugin "**stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file**". This directly aligns with CWE-260, "Password in Configuration File," which describes the **rootcause** of storing passwords in a configuration file that might be accessible to unauthorized actors. This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, "The Squash TM Publisher (Squash4Jenkins) Plugin stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller." While other CWEs like CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) are relevant, CWE-260 is more specific as it highlights the configuration file storage, making it the primary and most accurate classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-260 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-260 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a class-level CWE that could apply, CWE-260 provides a more precise representation of the **weakness**. CWE-260 is related to CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password), which is a more general case of storing passwords in plaintext.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a relevant secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves **unencrypted storage of sensitive information**, specifically passwords. While CWE-260 is more specific about the configuration file, CWE-256 accurately describes the underlying issue of storing passwords in plaintext. The description mentions the password can be viewed, thus this directly related to the storage and not transport of the credentials. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-256 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). It is more specific than its parent, making it a better fit for the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Reasonable confidence, but CWE-260 is the more precise classification.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a relevant secondary CWE. The vulnerability description and CVE reference confirms the **rootcause** of storing sensitive information (passwords) in cleartext. This **weakness** aligns with the CWE-312 description. While other CWEs like CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) is more specific, CWE-312 accurately describes the underlying issue of storing sensitive information in cleartext. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-312 indicates that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 is a base-level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Reasonable confidence, but CWE-260 is the more precise classification.)



## Known Examples for CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30275](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30275): Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1126**: A vulnerability in the storage of proxy server credentials of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view credentials for a configured proxy server. The vulnerability is due to clear-text storage and weak permissions of related configuration files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of the affected software and viewing the contents of the affected files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials that are used to access the proxy server.
- **CVE-2021-41023**: A unprotected storage of credentials in Fortinet FortiSIEM Windows Agent version 4.1.4 and below allows an authenticated user to disclosure agent password due to plaintext credential storage in log files
- **CVE-2021-1589**: A vulnerability in the disaster recovery feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials. This vulnerability exists because access to API endpoints is not properly restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials that could be used in further attacks.
- **CVE-2021-41297**: ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to weak access control mechanism allowing authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.
- **CVE-2021-21590**: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.
- **CVE-2021-21591**: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.
- **CVE-2021-36309**: Dell Enterprise SONiC OS, versions 3.3.0 and earlier, contains a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. An authenticated malicious user with access to the system may use the TACACS\\Radius credentials stored to read sensitive information and use it in further attacks.
- **CVE-2021-23207**: An attacker with physical access to the host can extract the secrets from the registry and create valid JWT tokens for the Fresenius Kabi Vigilant MasterMed version 2.0.1.3 application and impersonate arbitrary users. An attacker could manipulate RabbitMQ queues and messages by impersonating users.
- **CVE-2021-32978**: The programming protocol allows for a previously entered password and lock state to be read by an attacker. If the previously entered password was successful, the attacker can then use the password to unlock Automation Direct CLICK PLC CPU Modules: C0-1x CPUs with firmware prior to v3.00.
