# Analysis for CVE-2020-24203

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | The product allows the upload of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment, leading to remote code execution. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | The upload pic function in updatesubcategory.php lacks authentication, enabling unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**Insecure File Permissions and Arbitrary File Upload**" as the **rootcause**, directly aligning with CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type). The description also mentions that this leads to "remote code execution," which is a typical impact of such a vulnerability. The CWE description fits as the product allows the upload of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.
  - *Explanation:* Additionally, the provided content from the CVE reference links describes an "unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)" vulnerability. While the primary vulnerability is the **arbitrary file upload**, the lack of authentication contributes to the exploitability. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is added as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability exists in the "upload pic function in updatesubcategory.php" and the description mentions "remote unauthenticated attackers." This means the upload function lacks authentication.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-434 is a base-level CWE, making it appropriate for mapping to the **root cause** of the vulnerability. It is also related to other CWEs such as CWE-669 (Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres), but CWE-434 is the most direct and relevant. CWE-306 could be a prerequisite to exploiting CWE-434 in this context.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the clear statement of arbitrary file upload and resulting remote code execution)
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Medium confidence because it is implied by the unauthenticated attackers and not explicitly stated that the function lacks authentication.)
