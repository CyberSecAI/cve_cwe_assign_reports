| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" in `copy_bytes` function due to a crafted dwg file. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by detailing that the overflow occurs because `section->data_size` might exceed the allocated `section_page->uncomp_size`. This leads to writing beyond the allocated buffer. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE that precisely describes this condition where the buffer overflow occurs in the heap. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also applicable as a general case of writing outside the allocated memory, CWE-122 is more specific and therefore more appropriate. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-122 for heap overflow conditions.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as it is a specific type of out-of-bounds write occurring in the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "heap buffer overflow" and supporting details from the CVE reference)
