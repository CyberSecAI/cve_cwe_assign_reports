  "query": "A vulnerability in the account activation feature of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send an account activation email with an activation link that points to an arbitrary domain. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the account activation page of Cisco Webex Meetings. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send to any recipient an account activation email that contains a tampered activation link, which could direct the user to an attacker-controlled website.",
