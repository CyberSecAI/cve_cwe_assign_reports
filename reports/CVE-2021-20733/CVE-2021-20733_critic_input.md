## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**Improper authorization** in handler for custom URL scheme vulnerability". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating "The `asken` App for Android does not properly restrict access to its custom URL scheme functionality," and explicitly mentions "**Improper Restriction of Custom URL Schemes (CWE-939)**". This aligns directly with CWE-939's description: "The product uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme." The impact, where an attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary website, supports this classification.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-939 has no direct relationships in the provided data. However, it's important to note that improper authorization can often lead to other weaknesses. The ability to redirect to arbitrary websites could potentially lead to phishing attacks (CWE-451), where the user interface is misrepresented.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the primary weakness is the improper authorization of the custom URL scheme, a secondary impact is the potential for **user interface misrepresentation**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary notes that the redirection capability can be used for phishing attacks. This aligns with CWE-451: "The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed." The attacker can redirect users to a fake website, mimicking a trusted service, and steal their credentials. This is a classic example of UI misrepresentation. This is a secondary effect of the main weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-451 is a Class-level CWE, and while it doesn't have direct relationships in the provided data, it's related to vulnerabilities that involve deceiving the user through UI manipulation. Given that the redirection can lead to phishing, CWE-451 is a reasonable secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate evidence. The phishing attack is a potential consequence of the primary weakness but isn't explicitly stated as a definite outcome.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme.

### Extended Description
Mobile platforms and other architectures allow the use of custom URL schemes to facilitate communication between applications. In the case of iOS, this is the only method to do inter-application communication. The implementation is at the developer's discretion which may open security flaws in the application. An example could be potentially dangerous functionality such as modifying files through a custom URL scheme.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-862

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Utilize a user prompt pop-up to authorize potentially harmful actions such as those modifying data or dealing with sensitive information.


When designing functionality of actions in the URL scheme, consider whether the action should be accessible to all mobile applications, or if an allowlist of applications to interface with is appropriate.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2013-5725:** URL scheme has action replace which requires no user prompt and allows remote attackers to perform undesired actions.
- **CVE-2013-5726:** URL scheme has action follow and favorite which allows remote attackers to force user to perform undesired actions.



## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

### Extended Description


If an attacker can cause the UI to display erroneous data, or to otherwise convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source, then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. This is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. For example, if the UI is used to monitor the security state of a system or network, then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from detecting and reacting to a security-critical event.


UI misrepresentation can take many forms:


  - Incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations. This can be broken down into several different subtypes.

  - Overlay: an area of the display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify the display by overlaying another element on top of it. The user is not interacting with the expected portion of the user interface. This is the problem that enables clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve overlay.

  - Icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can be influenced (such as making a dangerous .EXE executable look like a harmless .GIF)

  - Timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. The race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.

  - Visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display, such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the GUI because the malicious portion is truncated. The use of excessive whitespace can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside of the user's field of view (e.g. "filename.txt .exe"). A different type of truncation can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle of an input, such as a NUL byte in a C-style string.

  - Visual distinction: visual information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of the display.

  - Homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as a trusted site). This can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.
