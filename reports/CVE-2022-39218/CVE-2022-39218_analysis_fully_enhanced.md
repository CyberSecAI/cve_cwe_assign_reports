## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is a **fixed seed for the PRNG**, specifically in the `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` methods in the JS Compute Runtime for Fastly's Compute@Edge platform. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating that "the initial seed for the CSPRNG used by `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` was baked into the WebAssembly module during compilation". This aligns perfectly with CWE-336, "Same Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)," which is a Variant-level CWE and is ALLOWED according to MITRE's mapping guidance. The impact of this **weakness** is that an attacker can predict random numbers and bypass cryptographic security controls.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-336 is a variant of CWE-335 (Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)). While CWE-335 is also a potential candidate, CWE-336 is more specific because the seed is the same every time. CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-336, but it's less specific and therefore less appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the explicit description of the fixed seed and the direct match with CWE-336).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) is a Class-level CWE that encompasses the broader issue of using weak or predictable random numbers. While CWE-336 is a more precise classification, CWE-330 can be considered as a secondary candidate because the **fixed seed** leads to insufficiently random values. However, because CWE-336 captures the specific mechanism, it is the primary CWE. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-330 is "Discouraged" because it is a Class, and more specific children might be more appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-330 is a parent of CWE-336, indicating that the specific weakness (fixed seed) falls under the broader category of using insufficiently random values.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence, as CWE-330 represents a higher-level view of the issue).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) could also be considered, but the vulnerability description explicitly states the seed is the *same*, which is more precisely captured by CWE-336, rather than merely predictable. This is a subtle but important distinction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-337 is a variant of CWE-335, similar to CWE-336. The choice between them hinges on the specific details in the vulnerability description, and here, the fixed seed leads to choosing CWE-336.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence, as while the seed is predictable, the primary issue is that it's consistently the *same*).



## Known Examples for CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-7010** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7010](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7010): Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2019-11495** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-11495](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-11495): server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds
- **CVE-2008-0166** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0166](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0166): The removal of a couple lines of code caused Debian's OpenSSL Package to only use the current process ID for seeding a PRNG
- **CVE-2016-10180** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10180](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10180): Router's PIN generation is based on rand(time(0)) seeding.

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32033**: Protectimus SLIM NFC 70 10.01 devices allow a Time Traveler attack in which attackers can predict TOTP passwords in certain situations. The time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value for generating time-based one-time passwords, without authentication. Thus, an attacker with short-time physical access to a device can set the internal real-time clock (RTC) to the future, generate one-time passwords, and reset the clock to the current time. This allows the generation of valid future time-based one-time passwords without having further access to the hardware token.
- **CVE-2022-29965**: The Emerson DeltaV Distributed Control System (DCS) controllers and IO cards through 2022-04-29 misuse passwords. Access to privileged operations on the maintenance port TELNET interface (23/TCP) on M-series and SIS (CSLS/LSNB/LSNG) nodes is controlled by means of utility passwords. These passwords are generated using a deterministic, insecure algorithm using a single seed value composed of a day/hour/minute timestamp with less than 16 bits of entropy. The seed value is fed through a lookup table and a series of permutation operations resulting in three different four-character passwords corresponding to different privilege levels. An attacker can easily reconstruct these passwords and thus gain access to privileged maintenance operations. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2014-2350.
- **CVE-2022-31008**: RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions: `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.
- **CVE-2022-31034**: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v0.11.0 are vulnerable to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from the Argo CD CLI or UI. The vulnerabilities are due to the use of insufficiently random values in parameters in Oauth2/OIDC login flows. In each case, using a relatively-predictable (time-based) seed in a non-cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator made the parameter less random than required by the relevant spec or by general best practices. In some cases, using too short a value made the entropy even less sufficient. The attacks on login flows which are meant to be mitigated by these parameters are difficult to accomplish but can have a high impact potentially granting an attacker admin access to Argo CD. Patches for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: v2.4.1, v2.3.5, v2.2.10 and v2.1.16. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2022-42159**: D-Link COVR 1200,1202,1203 v1.08 was discovered to have a predictable seed in a Pseudo-Random Number Generator.
