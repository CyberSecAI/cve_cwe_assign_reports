# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-4036

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-328 | Use of Weak Hash | 0.90 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | 0.60 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states the plugin uses an **insufficiently strong hashing algorithm** on the CAPTCHA secret, which is exposed to the user via a cookie. This directly aligns with CWE-328, "Use of Weak Hash". The CVE reference confirms that the **root cause** is the weak hashing algorithm, allowing attackers to predict CAPTCHA values and bypass the CAPTCHA protection. CWE-328 is a Base level CWE, making it suitable for mapping the root cause of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-328 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* Although there are no direct relationships for CWE-328, the description indicates that the CAPTCHA is implemented with a hashing algorithm that does not meet security expectations. CWE-330 "Use of Insufficiently Random Values" is a Class-level CWE that could be considered as a related issue, given a weak hash might be considered "insufficiently random." However, since the primary issue is the hashing algorithm itself, CWE-328 is a more direct and specific match.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to explicit mention of a **weak hashing algorithm** and confirmation from the CVE reference).

- **CVE-2005-4900** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4900](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4900): SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.
- **CVE-2020-25685** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-25685](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-25685): DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.
- **CVE-2012-6707** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-6707](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-6707): blogging product uses MD5-based algorithm for passwords.

- **CVE-2017-15999** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15999](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15999): mobile app for backup sends SHA-1 hash of password in cleartext.
- **CVE-2006-4068** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4068): Hard-coded hashed values for username and password contained in client-side script, allowing brute-force offline attacks.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21474**: SAP HANA Database, versions - 1.0, 2.0, accepts SAML tokens with MD5 digest, an attacker who manages to obtain an MD5-digest signed SAML Assertion issued for an SAP HANA instance might be able to tamper with it and alter it in a way that the digest continues to be the same and without invalidating the digital signature, this allows them to impersonate as user in HANA database and be able to read the contents in the database.
- **CVE-2021-23855**: The user and password data base is exposed by an unprotected web server resource. Passwords are hashed with a weak hashing algorithm and therefore allow an attacker to determine the password by using rainbow tables.
- **CVE-2021-28093**: OX Documents before 7.10.5-rev5 has Incorrect Access Control of converted images because hash collisions can occur, due to use of Adler32.
