# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-1126

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability is due to the **clear-text storage** of credentials, making this the primary weakness. |
| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability is due to **weak permissions** on configuration files, making this a secondary weakness. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves **clear-text storage** of proxy server credentials and **weak permissions** on related configuration files. This aligns perfectly with CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password), as the core issue is storing sensitive data (passwords) without encryption. Additionally, the **weak permissions** aspect points to CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions), as the configuration files are accessible to an attacker due to overly permissive settings.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-256 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. It's a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), but CWE-256 is more specific and accurately reflects the **clear-text storage** issue. CWE-276 addresses the **weak permissions** aspect, indicating a compound vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials for CWE-256)
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials for CWE-276)

The retrieved results listed several candidate CWEs:
*   CWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision - While the attacker is authenticated, the reliance on **untrusted inputs** is not the primary issue; it's the **clear-text storage** and **weak permissions**. Therefore, not selected.
*   CWE-1391 Use of Default Credentials - There is no mention of default credentials being used. Therefore, not selected.
*   CWE-497 Sensitive Information Accessible to an Unauthorized Control Sphere - This is a broader category, and the **clear-text storage** (CWE-256) and **weak permissions** (CWE-276) are more specific. Therefore, not selected.
*   CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel - This doesn't apply as the attacker is authenticated, but exploiting existing files due to their exposure due to **weak permissions**
*   CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm - Not applicable, as the issue isn't with the algorithm but the storage of credentials. Therefore, not selected.
*   CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials - This doesn't apply as the credentials are not hard-coded but rather stored in **clear-text**. Therefore, not selected.
*   CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere - Too high-level. The more specific CWEs, CWE-256 and CWE-276, are more appropriate. Therefore, not selected.
*   CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information - Similar to CWE-256, but CWE-256 is more specific to passwords. Therefore, CWE-256 is preferred.
*   CWE-41 Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence - Not applicable, as the vulnerability doesn't involve path equivalence issues. Therefore, not selected.
*   CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage - Not applicable, as the issue is not about removing sensitive information but about storing it in **clear-text**. Therefore, not selected.



## Known Examples for CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-3733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-3733): Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2005-0406** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0406](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0406): Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).
- **CVE-2002-0704** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0704](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0704): NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-3031**: Padding bytes in Ethernet packets on PA-200, PA-220, PA-500, PA-800, PA-2000 Series, PA-3000 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series firewalls are not cleared before the data frame is created. This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.
- **CVE-2021-3681**: A flaw was found in Ansible Galaxy Collections. When collections are built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not explicitly excluded via the ``build_ignore`` list in "galaxy.yml" include files in the ``.tar.gz`` file. This contains sensitive info, such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` verbose output without the``no_log`` redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.
- **CVE-2021-3602**: An information disclosure flaw was found in Buildah, when building containers using chroot isolation. Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials).
- **CVE-2022-24719**: Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.
- **CVE-2022-24798**: Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
- **CVE-2022-2818**: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer in GitHub repository cockpit-hq/cockpit prior to 2.2.2. 
- **CVE-2022-25187**: Jenkins Support Core Plugin 2.79 and earlier does not redact some sensitive information in the support bundle.
