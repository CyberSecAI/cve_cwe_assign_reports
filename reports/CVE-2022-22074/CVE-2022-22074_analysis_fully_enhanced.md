# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that it is due to an **integer overflow** during wma file playback. This aligns directly with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The **integer overflow** leads to **memory corruption**, implying that the overflowed value is then used in a way that causes memory to be accessed incorrectly.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a base level CWE. It can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). While CWE-787 is a potential consequence of the **integer overflow**, the provided information does not explicitly state an out-of-bounds write, so it will be listed as a secondary candidate. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) is also a potential consequence and thus a secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence for CWE-190 due to direct mention of **integer overflow** in the vulnerability description, and medium confidence for CWE-787 and CWE-131 as potential consequences)



## Known Examples for CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545): Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.
- **CVE-2021-30860** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30860](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30860): Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-30663** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663): Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2018-10887** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887): Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **CVE-2019-1010006** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006): Chain: compiler optimization (CWE-733) removes or modifies code used to detect integer overflow (CWE-190), allowing out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2010-2753** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753): Chain: integer overflow leads to use-after-free
- **CVE-2005-1513** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513): Chain: integer overflow in securely-coded mail program leads to buffer overflow. In 2005, this was regarded as unrealistic to exploit, but in 2020, it was rediscovered to be easier to exploit due to evolutions of the technology.
