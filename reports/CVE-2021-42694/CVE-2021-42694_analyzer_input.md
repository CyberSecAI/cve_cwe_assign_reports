# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-42694

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the character definitions of the Unicode Specification through 14.0. The specification allows an adversary to produce source code identifiers such as function names using homoglyphs that render visually identical to a target identifier. Adversaries can leverage this to inject code via adversarial identifier definitions in upstream software dependencies invoked deceptively in downstream software. NOTE the Unicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard (all versions). Unless mitigated, an adversary could produce source code identifiers using homoglyph characters that render visually identical to but are distinct from a target identifier. In this way, an adversary could inject adversarial identifier definitions in upstream software that are not detected by human reviewers and are invoked deceptively in downstream software. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of security vulnerability in its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42694:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided documents directly reference CVE-2021-42694, describing it as a vulnerability related to homoglyphs in source code identifiers. This aligns with the official description of CVE-2021-42694.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of **homoglyphs** in source code identifiers. Homoglyphs are characters that visually appear nearly identical but have different underlying Unicode code points.  This allows an attacker to create identifiers (like function names or variables) that visually resemble legitimate identifiers, but are treated as different identifiers by the compiler or interpreter.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Visual Deception:** The primary weakness is the ability to create source code where the visual appearance differs from its actual logical meaning.
*   **Homoglyph Substitution:** Attackers can substitute legitimate identifiers with homoglyph equivalents, creating a similar-looking yet malicious identifier.
*   **Compiler/Interpreter Blindness:** Compilers and interpreters process code based on the underlying code points, not visual appearance, making them vulnerable to these kinds of attacks.
*   **Human Review Limitations:** Human reviewers can easily miss these subtle differences, as homoglyphs are very hard to distinguish by the naked eye.
*   **Supply Chain Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability can be injected into open-source code, which then gets included in downstream projects.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection/Manipulation:**  An attacker can introduce malicious code disguised as legitimate code, which executes unexpectedly.
*   **Compromised Logic:**  Code execution might be redirected to malicious homoglyph-named functions.
*   **Security Breaches:** This can lead to various security breaches, such as data leaks, privilege escalation, or other unauthorized actions depending on the type of code being attacked.
*  **Supply chain attacks**: As these kinds of attacks can be inserted in open source libraries it could have a far reaching impact.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Source Code Injection:**  Attackers modify source code by replacing identifiers using homoglyphs with malicious code or inserting malicious function in the same way.
*   **Open-Source Supply Chain:** Malicious code can be inserted into upstream dependencies where it can be inherited by downstream software without visual indication.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Modification Access:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the source code, either directly or through a vulnerable dependency in the supply chain.
*   **Knowledge of Homoglyphs:**  They need to be aware of homoglyph characters and how to use them.
*   **Understanding of Target Code:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the targeted source code, and which identifier can be swapped with a homoglyph to make it work.

**Additional details from the analysis:**
*   **Mitigations:** The documents recommend that:
    *   Compilers/interpreters, and build tools should detect homoglyphs and throw errors or warnings.
    *   Language specifications should restrict the usage of visually similar character in identifiers.
    *   Code editors and repository frontends should make homoglyphs visible.
*   **Rust's Response:** The Rust Security Response WG stated that while Rust versions prior to 1.53 are not affected by this because it does not support non-ASCII identifiers, Rust 1.53.0 and later versions do support non-ASCII identifiers and have lints to alert developers about the presence of homoglyphs or similar issues.
*   **Real-World Examples:** The `scyon.nl` article provides examples with various languages and code snippets to illustrate the real-world impact.
*   **Unicode Standard Guidance:** Unicode Technical Report #39, "Unicode Security Mechanisms", provides mechanisms for detecting and mitigating homoglyph-related attacks.

In summary, CVE-2021-42694 is a serious vulnerability exploiting the visual similarity of characters in source code. It can be used to inject malicious code by deceiving human reviewers and by misdirecting compiler/interpreter. This can have a wide spread impact when it happens in popular open source packages and libraries.
