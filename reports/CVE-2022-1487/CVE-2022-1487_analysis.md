## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Use after free**" in the Ozone component of Google Chrome. This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes a scenario where a program reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The provided content summary from the CVE reference links further reinforces this, stating "Use-after-free vulnerability in the Ozone component of Chrome." The "**heap corruption**" mentioned in the description is a potential consequence of use-after-free, but CWE-416 directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The retriever results also identify CWE-416 as the top candidate with a high score. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED, making it a suitable mapping for this vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a Variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). While other CWEs such as CWE-415 (Double Free) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) are also related to memory management issues, CWE-416 provides the most accurate and specific description of the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)
