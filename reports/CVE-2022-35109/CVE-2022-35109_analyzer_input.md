## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in `swftools`, specifically in the `pdf2swf` component. Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. Heap Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `draw_stroke` function within `stroke.c`.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `draw_stroke` function attempts to write 8 bytes to a memory location that is outside of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap overflow.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption and potential crash of the `pdf2swf` application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerable code path during processing.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The crash occurs at `stroke.c:207:17` in `draw_stroke`.
    *   The overflow writes 8 bytes at address `0x607000000690`, which is outside the 80-byte region allocated at `0x607000000640`.
    *   The memory is allocated at `stroke.c:192:26` in the same `draw_stroke` function.
    *   The vulnerable command to reproduce the issue is: `./pdf2swf -G -f -t [sample file] -o /dev/null` with the supplied sample file.

**2. Stack Buffer Overflow (Multiple Instances)**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack buffer overflows occur in multiple locations, primarily due to excessive recursion or uncontrolled string manipulation.
*   **Vulnerability:** The stack overflows occur while allocating memory for stack trace, copying strings, and during vfprintf calls in different contexts.
*   **Impact:** Application crash due to stack exhaustion.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF files that lead to deep recursion, large string copies, or cause errors that trigger vfprintf.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Instance 1 (`id407_stack_overflow_getcurrentthread.zip`):** Stack overflow during stack trace allocation via `__sanitizer::StackDepotNode::hash`, triggered within the `Parser::getObj` function.
    *  **Instance 2 (`id465_stack_overflow_buffered_vfprintf.zip`):** Stack overflow occurs within the `vfprintf` function, due to an error in parsing PDF objects using `Parser::getObj`.
    *   **Instance 3 (`id479_stack_overflow___asanAllocatorAllocate.zip`):** Stack overflow occurs during ASan's stack trace allocation within the `__asan::Allocator::QuarantineChunk` function called through the free operation during object parsing.
    *   The common factor is that the overflow is triggered during PDF parsing and related operations like memory allocation/deallocation and stack trace capture.
    *   The vulnerable command to reproduce the issue is: `./pdf2swf -G -f -t [sample file] -o /dev/null` with the respective sample files.

**3. Memory Leak**

*   **Root Cause:** Memory is allocated in `rfx_alloc` but not freed, leading to a memory leak.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unreleased allocated memory in `rfx_alloc`.
*   **Impact:** Gradual memory consumption leading to performance degradation or potential resource exhaustion.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF files that trigger the allocation without the corresponding free.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.
*  **Technical Details:**
    *   Leak of 96 bytes in 2 objects, allocated via `rfx_alloc`
    *   LeakSanitizer reports the leak detected, specifically in allocations in `rfx_alloc`.
    *   The vulnerable command to reproduce the issue is: `./pdf2swf -G -f -t [sample file] -o /dev/null` with the supplied sample file.

**4. SEGV (Segmentation Fault)**

*   **Root Cause:** A segmentation fault occurs within the `DCTStream::getChar()` function, likely due to an invalid memory access when reading from a stream.
*   **Vulnerability:** Attempt to read from an invalid memory address.
*   **Impact:** Application crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF files that cause the `DCTStream::getChar()` function to attempt to access invalid memory.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.
*  **Technical Details:**
    *   The crash occurs in `DCTStream::getChar()` at `Stream.cc:2048:9`
    *   The segmentation fault occurs when reading from a potentially corrupted or invalid data stream.
    *   The vulnerable command to reproduce the issue is: `./pdf2swf -G -f -t [sample file] -o /dev/null` with the supplied sample file.

In summary, the report identifies a range of vulnerabilities (heap overflow, stack overflows, memory leak, and segmentation fault) in `swftools`, particularly in `pdf2swf`, when processing maliciously crafted PDF files. The vulnerabilities can lead to application crashes, resource exhaustion, or memory corruption.
