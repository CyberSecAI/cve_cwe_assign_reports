## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap-buffer overflow**" in the `draw_stroke` function at `/gfxpoly/stroke.c`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `draw_stroke` function attempts to write 8 bytes outside of the allocated buffer, which aligns precisely with CWE-787 (Write What Where Condition). The description details the exact location of the overflow in the code (stroke.c:207:17) and how to reproduce the vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE, and is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It describes writing data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
