## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**out of bounds write**" in Swiftshader within Google Chrome. This directly aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which describes a condition where a product writes data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The impact, heap corruption, further supports this classification. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the "**Out of bounds write**" as the root cause.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the **out-of-bounds write** vulnerability. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent class, CWE-787 is more precise and directly reflects the reported weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE definition, supported by CVE reference materials.)
