## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in Brocade Fabric OS CLI before Brocade Fabric OS v9.1.0, 9.0.1e, 8.2.3c, 8.2.0cbn5, 7.4.2.j could allow a remote authenticated attacker to perform **stack buffer overflow** using in firmwaredownload and diagshow commands.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**
- **attacker:** remote authenticated attacker
- **product:** Brocade Fabric OS
- **version:** before Brocade Fabric OS v9.1.0 and 9.0.1e and 8.2.3c and 8.2.0cbn5 and 7.4.2.j
- **component:** firmwaredownload and diagshow commands

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-33183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow.
*   It occurs in the Brocade Fabric OS CLI when using the `firmwaredownload` and `diagshow` commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The software does not properly validate the size of input data when processing the `firmwaredownload` and `diagshow` commands. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification/Addition:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution or the modification of system data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting the stack can corrupt program state, leading to application crashes or system instability, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely.
*   **Authenticated Attack:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Brocade Fabric OS CLI to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Brocade Fabric OS.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log in to the Brocade Fabric OS CLI.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute `firmwaredownload` or `diagshow` commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Brocade Fabric OS prior to specific patched versions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal penetration testing.
*   NetApp has also released an advisory related to this CVE because their products are affected.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 7.1 (HIGH)
