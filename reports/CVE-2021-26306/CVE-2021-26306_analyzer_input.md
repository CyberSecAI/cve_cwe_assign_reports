# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-26306

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the raw-cpuid crate before 9.0.0 for Rust. It has **unsound transmute calls** within as_string() methods.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unsound transmute calls**
- **product:** raw-cpuid crate
- **version:** before 9.0.0
- **component:** as_string() methods

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Undefined behavior in `as_string()` methods:** The `VendorInfo::as_string()`, `SoCVendorBrand::as_string()`, and `ExtendedFunctionInfo::processor_brand_string()` methods used `std::slice::from_raw_parts()` to create byte slices from `#[repr(Rust)]` structs. This is incorrect because the layout of `#[repr(Rust)]` structs is not guaranteed and can lead to undefined behavior.
*   **Unsound `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()`:** The `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` function directly exposed the unsafe `__cpuid_count()` intrinsic without checking if the CPU supports the function call, violating its safety requirements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The incorrect use of `std::slice::from_raw_parts()` with `#[repr(Rust)]` structs could lead to memory corruption due to the undefined memory layout.
*   **Denial of Service:** The `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` function could cause a crash if called on a CPU that does not support the instruction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Memory corruption could lead to unpredictable program behavior or a crash.
*   Calling `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` on unsupported CPUs leads to a deterministic crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by calling the affected functions (`as_string()` variants, or `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to call the vulnerable functions within a program using the affected `raw-cpuid` crate.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `raw-cpuid` crate compiles only on `x86` and `x86_64` architectures, limiting the scope of the vulnerability to these architectures.
*   The vulnerability in `as_string()` is related to the incorrect use of Rust's memory layout mechanisms, specifically using `std::slice::from_raw_parts()` with a `#[repr(Rust)]` struct.
*   The `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` vulnerability is due to exposing an unsafe function as safe without performing the required safety checks.
* The fix involved changing the struct representation to `#[repr(C)]` and intentionally breaking compilation when targeting SGX or 32-bit x86 without SSE.
