| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.70 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**stack corruption** while parsing PCB files," which directly points to memory corruption issues. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies this by stating "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)." However, since the vulnerability specifically mentions **stack corruption**, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a more specific and appropriate primary mapping because stack corruption often involves writing outside the intended buffer boundaries. CWE-119 is a broader category that encompasses various memory boundary issues; therefore, while relevant, it is a secondary consideration. The **root cause** of this vulnerability is the improper handling of PCB files, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a class-level CWE. Selecting CWE-787 provides a more specific classification than CWE-119. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-787, but the description does not provide enough detail to say that this is specifically a stack-based buffer overflow, so the more general CWE-787 is more appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack corruption" and the confirmation in the CVE reference summary pointing to "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer".)
