## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetQosBand` function within the `tdhttpd` binary of the Tenda AX1806 router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The `formSetQosBand` function, accessible via the URL `goform/SetNetControlList`, is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow. This occurs when processing user-supplied input in the `list` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates that sending a large string of 'A' characters (0x400 bytes) in the `list` parameter causes a crash, leading to a denial of service. This would disrupt the normal operation of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetNetControlList` endpoint.
*   **`list` Parameter:** The overflow occurs when processing the `list` parameter within the POST request data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This likely means they need to be on the same network or have a way to reach the router's web interface.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Firmware Version:** The vulnerability is present in firmware version v1.0.0.1.
*   **Proof-of-Concept:** A Python script is provided that demonstrates how to trigger the stack overflow, causing a denial of service.
*   **Binary Location:** The vulnerable `tdhttpd` binary is located in the `/bin` directory.
*   **Function:** The vulnerable function is `formSetQosBand`.

This analysis provides more specific information than a generic CVE description, particularly in the location of the vulnerable function, binary, and PoC.
