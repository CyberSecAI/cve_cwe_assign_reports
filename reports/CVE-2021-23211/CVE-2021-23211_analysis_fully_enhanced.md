# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-316 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory | 1.00 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. Matches the vulnerability description explicitly. |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. A more general case of CWE-316. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** in Memory" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms "**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory. Specifically, the Cloud end-to-end encryption key is stored in cleartext in the Gallagher Command Centre Server's memory." This directly maps to CWE-316 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory), which is a Variant level CWE. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-316 indicates this is ALLOWED. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a more general case (Base) of storing sensitive information in cleartext, but CWE-316 is more specific and appropriate here.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-316 is a child of CWE-312, which is in turn a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). The vulnerability can potentially precede CWE-200 (Information Exposure) if the memory containing the cleartext key is accessible.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-23211**: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory vulnerability in Gallagher Command Centre Server allows Cloud end-to-end encryption key to be discoverable in server memory dumps. This issue affects: Gallagher Command Centre 8.40 versions prior to 8.40.1888 (MR3).
- **CVE-2021-29950**: Thunderbird unprotects a secret OpenPGP key prior to using it for a decryption, signing or key import task. If the task runs into a failure, the secret key may remain in memory in its unprotected state. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.8.1.
- **CVE-2021-32942**: The vulnerability could expose cleartext credentials from AVEVA InTouch Runtime 2020 R2 and all prior versions (WindowViewer) if an authorized, privileged user creates a diagnostic memory dump of the process and saves it to a non-protected location.
- **CVE-2021-23182**: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory vulnerability in Gallagher Command Centre Server allows OSDP reader master keys to be discoverable in server memory dumps. This issue affects: Gallagher Command Centre 8.40 versions prior to 8.40.1888 (MR3); All versions of 8.30.
- **CVE-2021-38150**: When an attacker manages to get access to the local memory, or the memory dump of a victim, for example by a social engineering attack, SAP Business Client versions - 7.0, 7.70, will allow him to read extremely sensitive data, such as credentials. This would allow the attacker to compromise the corresponding backend for which the credentials are valid.
- **CVE-2022-29832**: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation GX Works3 versions 1.015R and later, GX Works2 all versions and GX Developer versions 8.40S and later allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to disclose sensitive information. As a result, unauthenticated users could obtain information about the project file for MELSEC safety CPU modules or project file for MELSEC Q/FX/L series with security setting.
- **CVE-2022-31205**: In Omron CS series, CJ series, and CP series PLCs through 2022-05-18, the password for access to the Web UI is stored in memory area D1449...D1452 and can be read out using the Omron FINS protocol without any further authentication.
