# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-34549

## Query
An issue was discovered in Tor before 0.4.6.5, aka TROVE-2021-005. Hashing is mishandled for certain retrieval of circuit data. Consequently. an attacker can trigger the use of an attacker-chosen circuit ID to cause algorithm inefficiency.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: mishandling of hashing
