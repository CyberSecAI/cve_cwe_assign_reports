```markdown
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**heap-buffer overflow**" in OTFCC v0.10.4. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, detailing "**Heap Buffer Overflow**" issues due to improper bounds checking during memory manipulation on the heap, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE that directly addresses this type of vulnerability, making it the most appropriate primary mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance allows this CWE entry. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a broader classification, the evidence specifically points to a heap-based overflow, justifying the selection of CWE-122.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The relationship analysis shows that CWE-122 CanFollow other CWEs like CWE-825, CWE-824, CWE-823, and CWE-822, since heap overflows can lead to various memory corruption scenarios.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "heap-buffer overflow" and supporting details in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary)
