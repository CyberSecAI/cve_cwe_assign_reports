| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability is caused by a **loose comparison (==) in SetupController** that is susceptible to attack." This directly indicates the use of an incorrect operator for comparison, which falls under CWE-480 (Use of Incorrect Operator). The impact is that an attacker can gain admin access. The CVE reference details further confirm this by stating that the initial implementation used a loose comparison (`==`) to verify the setup key, allowing attackers to bypass the authorization check. CWE-480 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for mapping the root cause.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-480 doesn't have any direct relationships that would strongly influence the mapping. However, the weakness leads to an authentication bypass which can be related to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While CWE-480 is the direct cause, the lack of proper authentication arising from this incorrect operator contributes to the vulnerability."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability allows attackers to gain admin access to site instances, even if they do not possess an existing account." This indicates a failure in the authentication mechanism, which aligns with CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The vulnerability description explains that by crafting a request to the `/setup/finish` endpoint, attackers can obtain admin privileges. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights that the **insecure type comparison** allowed bypassing the authorization check. This shows that a critical function i.e. the setup process which requires authentication is missing it.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-306 is related to other authentication-related CWEs, such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but is more specific as it describes the complete absence of authentication for a critical function rather than an improper authentication implementation. It's a base-level CWE, providing a good level of detail."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.70 (Supporting evidence, but not as direct as CWE-480)



## Known Examples for CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-3979** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3979](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3979): Chain: data visualization program written in PHP uses the "!=" operator instead of the type-strict "!==" operator (CWE-480) when validating hash values, potentially leading to an incorrect type conversion (CWE-704)
- **CVE-2021-3116** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3116](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3116): Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21276**: Polr is an open source URL shortener. in Polr before version 2.3.0, a vulnerability in the setup process allows attackers to gain admin access to site instances, even if they do not possess an existing account. This vulnerability exists regardless of users' settings. If an attacker crafts a request with specific cookie headers to the /setup/finish endpoint, they may be able to obtain admin privileges on the instance. This is caused by a loose comparison (==) in SetupController that is susceptible to attack. The project has been patched to ensure that a strict comparison (===) is used to verify the setup key, and that /setup/finish verifies that no users table exists before performing any migrations or provisioning any new accounts. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. Users can patch this vulnerability without upgrading by adding abort(404) to the very first line of finishSetup in SetupController.php.
- **CVE-2021-32648**: octobercms in a CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions of the october/system package an attacker can request an account password reset and then gain access to the account using a specially crafted request. The issue has been patched in Build 472 and v1.1.5.
