# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-41458

## Vulnerability Description
In GPAC MP4Box v1.1.0, there is a **stack buffer overflow** at src/utils/error.c1769 which leads to a denial of service vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **product:** GPAC MP4Box
- **version:** v1.1.0
- **component:** src/utils/error.c1769

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Segmentation Fault (SEGV) occurring within the `gf_blob_get` function at `src/utils/error.c:1769`. This is due to a READ memory access on an unknown address. The issue is triggered during the processing of a `.nhml` file using `MP4Box`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is a memory access violation. Specifically, the program attempts to read from an invalid or unmapped memory address within `gf_blob_get`.
- The `gf_blob_get` function is likely not correctly handling cases where it is asked to access data from a blob, leading to the out-of-bounds read.
- The usage of `gf_blob_get` when processing the `.nhml` file is revealing a flaw in the memory management or handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a crash of the MP4Box application due to the SEGV.
- This crash can lead to denial-of-service scenarios. If the MP4Box application is being used in an automated pipeline, this crash could interrupt workflows.
- While not explicitly stated, the nature of the crash suggests a potential for exploitation beyond a simple crash if more control over memory layout and access could be achieved. However, this is speculative based on the information given.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through processing of a maliciously crafted `.nhml` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.nhml` file to the MP4Box application. This could be through direct access to the application or by tricking a user into processing the malicious file.
- The attacker would also need knowledge about the vulnerability, although it may be possible to discover it through fuzzing or similar automated techniques.

**Additional details:**
- The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) report gives a very detailed view of the crash including stack traces.
- The issue is reproducible with the command `MP4Box -add poc.nhml -new new.mp4` using a nightly build of GPAC.
- This issue was resolved by commit `74695dea7278e78af3db467e586233fe8773c07e`.
