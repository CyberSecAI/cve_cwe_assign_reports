### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **product:** GPAC MP4Box
- **version:** v1.1.0
- **component:** src/utils/error.c1769

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Segmentation Fault (SEGV) occurring within the `gf_blob_get` function at `src/utils/error.c:1769`. This is due to a READ memory access on an unknown address. The issue is triggered during the processing of a `.nhml` file using `MP4Box`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is a memory access violation. Specifically, the program attempts to read from an invalid or unmapped memory address within `gf_blob_get`.
- The `gf_blob_get` function is likely not correctly handling cases where it is asked to access data from a blob, leading to the out-of-bounds read.
- The usage of `gf_blob_get` when processing the `.nhml` file is revealing a flaw in the memory management or handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a crash of the MP4Box application due to the SEGV.
- This crash can lead to denial-of-service scenarios. If the MP4Box application is being used in an automated pipeline, this crash could interrupt workflows.
- While not explicitly stated, the nature of the crash suggests a potential for exploitation beyond a simple crash if more control over memory layout and access could be achieved. However, this is speculative based on the information given.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through processing of a maliciously crafted `.nhml` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.nhml` file to the MP4Box application. This could be through direct access to the application or by tricking a user into processing the malicious file.
- The attacker would also need knowledge about the vulnerability, although it may be possible to discover it through fuzzing or similar automated techniques.

**Additional details:**
- The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) report gives a very detailed view of the crash including stack traces.
- The issue is reproducible with the command `MP4Box -add poc.nhml -new new.mp4` using a nightly build of GPAC.
- This issue was resolved by commit `74695dea7278e78af3db467e586233fe8773c07e`.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate a **stack buffer overflow** that leads to a denial of service due to a memory access violation within the `gf_blob_get` function. The program attempts to read from an invalid memory address, resulting in a segmentation fault (SEGV). This aligns with **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, which describes a product reading data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The ASAN report further supports this by detailing the memory access violation. This is the primary root cause of the vulnerability. Although the vulnerability description mentions a **stack buffer overflow**, the more precise issue is the out-of-bounds read occurring within the stack, making CWE-125 more appropriate as the primary CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While the initial description points to a stack buffer overflow, the analysis reveals an out-of-bounds read as the root cause. CWE-125 is a base-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-125 relates to CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), which is a variant, but the more general "out-of-bounds read" is more fitting initially.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials, including ASAN report and root cause analysis.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* Given that the initial description highlights a **stack buffer overflow**, **CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow)** is also considered. While the root cause is an out-of-bounds read, the context of a stack buffer increases the likelihood of this vulnerability leading to control-flow hijacking or arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites return addresses or function pointers on the stack. CWE-121 is a variant, and the description mentions stack.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant and is related to buffer overflows on the stack, hence its inclusion as a secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Supports the type of buffer and memory location where the overflow occurred.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788
CanFollow -> CWE-170

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
