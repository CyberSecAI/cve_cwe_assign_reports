# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1714

## Vulnerability Description
**Out-of-bounds Read** in GitHub repository radareorg/radare2 prior to 5.7.0. The bug causes the program reads data past the end of the intented buffer. Typically, this can allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Out-of-bounds Read**
- **impact:** program reads data past the end of the intended buffer and read sensitive information from other memory locations and cause a crash
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** radare2
- **version:** prior to 5.7.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a fix for CVE-2022-1714.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A 4-byte out-of-bounds read in the MSP430 disassembler within the radare2 project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the code attempts to read 2 bytes for a jump address when the buffer has less than 4 bytes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to crashes, particularly in AddressSanitizer (ASAN) builds of radare2.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation would involve providing a crafted MSP430 binary or code snippet to radare2 that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted MSP430 binary or code snippet to the radare2 disassembler. No specific position or elevated privileges are explicitly required.

**Additional details:**
- The commit message states "Fix 4 byte oobread in msp430 disassembler ##crash".
- The fix involves adding a conditional check `if (len > 4)` before reading the jump address.
- The commit also adds a missing register definition for "=SN r0" in the MSP430 register profile.
- The vulnerability was reported by cnitlrt via huntr.dev and has a BountyID: 1c22055b-b015-47a8-a57b-4982978751d0.
