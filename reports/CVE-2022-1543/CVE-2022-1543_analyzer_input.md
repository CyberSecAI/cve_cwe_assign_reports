# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1543

## Vulnerability Description
**Improper handling of Length parameter** in GitHub repository erudika/scoold prior to 1.49.4. When the text size is large enough the service results in a momentary outage in a production environment. That can lead to memory corruption on the server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper handling of Length parameter**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **product:** scoold
- **version:** prior to 1.49.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-1543:

**1. Verification:**

The commit message "fixed profile name not limited in length" and the code changes directly relate to a length restriction issue, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) or data corruption if overly long names were allowed. This aligns with a common vulnerability pattern where input validation is lacking. While not explicitly stated that this is the fix for CVE-2022-1543, the context and code changes suggest it is very likely the fix for it.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the profile name field. Specifically, the code did not limit the length of the profile name, `originalName`,  before storing it in the database or using it in the application.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a maximum length check on the profile name (`name`, and `originalName`) field.
*   **Potential for Data Overflow:** Without a limit, users could potentially enter excessively long names which might lead to database storage issues, display errors, or even denial of service.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Corruption/Inconsistency:** Very long names might exceed database column limits, resulting in truncated or corrupted data. This could also lead to inconsistencies if the data is used in other parts of the application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not explicitly described in the content, if excessive data is used to create a user profile, it could lead to resource exhaustion impacting performance, database operations, or even crashing the application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** An attacker (or regular user) could exploit this by providing an extremely long string as their profile name during registration or profile editing.
*   **API/Direct Manipulation:** An attacker could also potentially exploit the vulnerability by directly interacting with the backend API that handles user profile data.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a registered user to modify their profile name.
*   **Basic Interaction:** The attack requires minimal technical skills, involving providing input to a text field.

**Changes to Address the Vulnerability:**

The commit fixes this issue by adding `StringUtils.abbreviate(name, 256)` and `StringUtils.abbreviate(originalName, 256)` to ensure that the profile names are always limited to 256 characters before being stored:

*   `ProfileController.java`:
    ```java
    showUser.setName(StringUtils.abbreviate(name, 256));
    ```
*  `Profile.java`:
    ```java
    this.originalName = StringUtils.abbreviate(originalName, 256);
    ```
*   `ScooldUtils.java`:
    ```java
    authUser.setName(StringUtils.abbreviate(u.getName(), 256));
    ```
**Summary:**

The commit addresses the lack of input validation on profile names, preventing users from inserting names that are too long by adding a 256 character limit using the `StringUtils.abbreviate` function. This vulnerability could have potentially resulted in data corruption or a denial of service.
