# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-1615

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC) Software for Catalyst Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected AP. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient buffer allocation**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available resources and cause a DoS condition on an affected AP, as well as a DoS condition for client traffic traversing the AP.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient buffer allocation**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted traffic
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC) Software
- **component:** packet processing functionality
