# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-40393

## Vulnerability Description
An **out-of-bounds write** vulnerability exists in the RS-274X aperture macro variables handling functionality of Gerbv 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and the forked version of Gerbv (commit 71493260). A specially-crafted gerber file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-40393:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way `gerbv` handles RS-274X format aperture macro variables, specifically during the parsing and execution of aperture macro templates.
*   The `simplify_aperture_macro` function lacks proper bounds checking when accessing and modifying an array of parameters used in the aperture macro execution. This leads to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The core vulnerability is the ability to write data outside of the allocated memory buffer for storing aperture macro parameters.
*   **Missing Bounds Checks:**  The code does not validate if the variable number (used as an index in the parameter array `lp`) is within the valid range.
*   **Lax Parsing of Template Macros:** The parser allows for assignment to arbitrary variables, including negative indices which are then used to write out of bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing to out-of-bounds memory, an attacker can overwrite critical data or program instructions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This is further facilitated by the fact that the values written in memory are directly controlled by the attacker.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Gerber File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted Gerber file containing a malicious aperture macro definition and instantiation.
*   **File Processing:**  The attacker supplies the malicious file to `gerbv`, which then parses and executes the vulnerable macro, triggering the out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to gerbv:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious Gerber file to `gerbv` for processing. This may involve uploading a crafted file to a service using gerbv for rendering.
*   **No user interaction or privileges:** The Talos report notes that the software is often used in automated workflows, making it reachable via the network without user interaction or specific privileges.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Functions:** The key functions involved are `gerbv_open_image`, `gerber_is_rs274x_p`, `parse_gerb`, `gerber_parse_file_segment`, `parse_rs274x`, `parse_aperture_macro`, `parse_aperture_definition`, and `simplify_aperture_macro`.
*   **Virtual Machine:**  `parse_aperture_macro` effectively constructs a virtual machine to interpret aperture macro templates, using a virtual stack and a parameter array. This is how the out-of-bounds access is enabled.
*   **Example Exploit:** The provided example shows how a negative variable name in an `AM` command can cause an out-of-bounds write when processing the associated `AD` command.
*   **Affected Versions:** gerbv versions 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and forked version of gerbv (commit 71493260) are vulnerable.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
