# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-24903

## Vulnerability Description
Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential **heap buffer overflow** when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.

- **product:** rsyslog
- **component:** TCP syslog reception modules

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-24903:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the TCP syslog server components of rsyslog. This occurs when handling octet-counted framing. Specifically, the issue is in how the octet count is read: digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count exceeds the maximum, causing a buffer overrun.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper bounds checking when writing the octet count digits to a buffer.
*   **Vulnerable Modules:** The vulnerability affects several rsyslog modules: `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imhttp`, `imgssapi`, and `imdiag`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Overwriting heap memory can corrupt data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Heap corruption can cause a crash or malfunction of the rsyslog service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While considered unlikely, remote code execution may be possible due to heap corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network connection.
*   **Specifically crafted syslog messages:**  The attacker sends specially crafted messages using TCP with octet-counted framing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of rsyslog.
*   **Knowledge of octet-counted framing:** The attacker must use octet-counted framing, a less common method, to trigger the overflow.
*   **No Privileges Needed:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any prior authentication or privileges on the target system.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Octet-counted framing:** This is a method for framing messages in syslog, where the length of the message is specified by a count of octets at the beginning of the message.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling octet-counted framing in `imtcp`, `imptcp` and `imhttp` modules or upgrading to a patched version of rsyslog.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 8.1.
*   **Affected Products:** NetApp's Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere is affected.
*   **Patches:**  Patches for the vulnerability have been released and are available through vendor websites.
