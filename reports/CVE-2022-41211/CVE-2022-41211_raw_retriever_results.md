# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-41211

## Query
Due to lack of proper memory management, when a victim opens manipulated file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Author and SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer, Arbitrary Code Execution can be triggered when payload forcesRe-use of dangling pointer which refers to overwritten space in memory. The accessed memory must be filled with code to execute the attack. Therefore, repeated success is unlikely.Stack-based buffer overflow. Since the memory overwritten is random, based on access rights of the memory, repeated success is not assured.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: lack of proper memory management
- **weakness**: Use-After-Free
