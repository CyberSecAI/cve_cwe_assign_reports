# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-676 | Use of Potentially Dangerous Function | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that "Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk AssetCentre v10.00 and earlier does not properly restrict all functions relating to IIS remoting services." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the root cause is "Improper restriction of functions related to IIS remoting services in FactoryTalk AssetCentre" and "Use of Potentially Dangerous Function (CWE-676): The application doesn't properly restrict functions related to IIS remoting." This aligns directly with CWE-676 (Use of Potentially Dangerous Function), indicating that the application uses a function that, if not properly restricted, can introduce a vulnerability. The impact of this vulnerability is that a "remote, unauthenticated attacker could modify sensitive data within FactoryTalk AssetCentre." The retriever results also list CWE-676 as a candidate. MITRE's mapping guidance for CWE-676 indicates it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-676 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. While other CWEs like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) are related to access control issues, CWE-676 is more specific to the **use of a potentially dangerous function** without proper restrictions, which is the core weakness here.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability enables a "remote, unauthenticated attacker to modify sensitive data." This suggests that authentication is either missing or insufficient for the functions being accessed via IIS remoting services. While CWE-676 describes the use of the dangerous function, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) highlights the lack of authentication that allows the attacker to exploit that function. The retriever results also identify CWE-306 as the highest-scoring candidate CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and is related to the lack of proper authentication mechanisms. While CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged, CWE-306 is a Base-level CWE and is ALLOWED. CWE-306 is considered a secondary weakness as it is enabled by the **improperly restricted function** (CWE-676). The relationship graph shows that CWE-306 can precede other vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Medium confidence, as it's a contributing factor but not the primary root cause. The primary root cause is the **improperly restricted function**.)
