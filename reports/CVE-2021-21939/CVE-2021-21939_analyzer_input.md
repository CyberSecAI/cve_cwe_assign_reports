## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the XWD parser of Accusoft ImageGear 19.10 due to a missing size check when copying data into a buffer. The size of the destination buffer `dst_buff` is calculated based on `PixmapWidth` and `PixmapDepth`, but this size is not compared with `BytesPerLine`. This allows a smaller buffer to be allocated, leading to the overflow when copying `BytesPerLine` bytes into `dst_buff`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to a missing size check before copying memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted XWD file can trigger the heap-based buffer overflow during parsing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious XWD file to the vulnerable application to trigger the overflow.
