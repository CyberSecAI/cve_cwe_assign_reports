# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.70 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "In C2SoftMP3process() of C2SoftMp3Dec.cpp, there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to a **heap buffer overflow**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is due to incorrect calculation of the output buffer size, leading to **out-of-bounds write** when writing to the heap. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) directly matches this scenario. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a related weakness because the **heap buffer overflow** leads to an **out-of-bounds write**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 is a broader category that includes heap, stack, and other types of out-of-bounds writes, making CWE-122 more specific in this context. CWE-787 is a parent of CWE-122.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference)
