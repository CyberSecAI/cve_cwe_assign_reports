## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** condition occurs due to the startTime and endTime parameters in the setParentalRules function. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant-level weakness specifically addressing overflows on the stack. The crafted POST request causing a Denial of Service (DoS) supports this classification. The Retriever results also list CWE-121 as a high-scoring candidate. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-121.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other CWEs are suggested by the retriever, such as CWE-790 (Improper Filtering of Special Elements) and CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions), these are less specific. CWE-790 is a Class-level CWE, and the description explicitly states a stack overflow, making CWE-121 more appropriate. CWE-755 is too generic.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of stack overflow and supporting details.)



## Known Examples for CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-41151** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151): SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked for writing but the server tries to send an error
- **[REF-1374]** [https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards): Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)
- **CVE-2021-3011** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3011](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3011): virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid value to a register, which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code
- **CVE-2008-4302** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4302](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4302): Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0668**: In apusys, there is a possible memory corruption due to incorrect error handling. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05670521; Issue ID: ALPS05670521.
- **CVE-2021-38003**: Inappropriate implementation in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 95.0.4638.69 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.
- **CVE-2021-28165**: In Eclipse Jetty 7.2.2 to 9.4.38, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.1, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.1, CPU usage can reach 100% upon receiving a large invalid TLS frame.
- **CVE-2021-0297**: A vulnerability in the processing of TCP MD5 authentication in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a BGP or LDP session configured with MD5 authentication to succeed, even if the peer does not have TCP MD5 authentication enabled. This could lead to untrusted or unauthorized sessions being established, resulting in an impact on confidentiality or stability of the network. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.3R2-S1-EVO; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO. Juniper Networks Junos OS is not affected by this issue.
- **CVE-2021-36128**: An issue was discovered in the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. Autoblocks for CentralAuth-issued suppression blocks are not properly implemented.
- **CVE-2021-0319**: In checkCallerIsSystemOr of CompanionDeviceManagerService.java, there is a possible way to get a nearby Bluetooth device's MAC address without appropriate permissions due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege that grants access to nearby MAC addresses, with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Product: Android; Versions: Android-8.0, Android-8.1, Android-9, Android-10, Android-11; Android ID: A-167244818.
