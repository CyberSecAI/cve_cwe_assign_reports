## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights an **improper handling of concurrent hypervisor operations** related to attaching/detaching IRQs, leading to memory corruption or denial of service. This strongly suggests a race condition, where multiple threads or processes access and manipulate shared resources (in this case, IRQs) concurrently without proper synchronization. CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) directly addresses this scenario, where the state of a resource changes between the time it's checked and the time it's used, leading to unexpected or erroneous behavior. The description clearly states this condition occurs during concurrent hypervisor operations.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-367 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis. While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-415 (Double Free) are related to memory corruption, they are impacts of the race condition rather than the root cause. The concurrent operations on IRQs is the key weakness.
The retriever results indicated CWE-367 is a plausible option."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the description matching a classic race condition scenario, but lacks specific details about the code implementation. The graph retriever supported the choice.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "Memory corruption is stated as an impact of the vulnerability. A potential impact of the race condition described in the vulnerability description is that the same memory location might be freed twice, due to the unsynchronized access. Therefore, CWE-415 (Double Free) is a possible secondary weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-415 is a Variant level CWE, indicating a more specific type of weakness than its potential parents. The retriever results indicated CWE-415 but with a low score and sparse support."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.4 (Low confidence due to the lack of direct evidence. This is only a plausible impact of the race condition described.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "Memory corruption is stated as an impact of the vulnerability. A potential impact of the race condition described in the vulnerability description is that memory could be written out of bounds. Therefore, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a possible secondary weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-787 is a Base level CWE. The retriever results indicated CWE-787 with a moderate score and support."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.4 (Low confidence due to the lack of direct evidence. This is only a plausible impact of the race condition described.)



## Known Examples for CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743): TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813): A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594): PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.
- **CVE-2008-2958** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
- **CVE-2008-1570** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1921**: Possible memory corruption due to Improper handling of hypervisor unmap operations for concurrent memory operations in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2021-29657**: arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.
- **CVE-2020-11233**: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition While processing partition entries due to newly created buffer was read again from mmc without validation in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables
- **CVE-2020-13882**: CISOfy Lynis before 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU race condition. The routine to check the log and report file permissions was not working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the race, an unprivileged attacker can set up a log and report file, and control that up to the point where the specific routine is doing its check. After that, the file can be removed, recreated, and used for additional attacks.
- **CVE-2020-15702**: TOCTOU Race Condition vulnerability in apport allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may exit the crashed process and exploit PID recycling to spawn a root process with the same PID as the crashed process, which can then be used to escalate privileges. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9 versions prior to 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.16 and 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.6. Was ZDI-CAN-11234.
