## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45926:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a dynamic stack buffer overflow in the `mdb_numeric_to_string` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A buffer overflow exists when converting a numeric value to a string representation within the `mdb_numeric_to_string` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The overflow can lead to a crash, potentially due to memory corruption.
- The Gentoo security advisory indicates this vulnerability, among others, is exploitable remotely.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted Microsoft Access database (MDB) file. This suggests the attack vector is through file parsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to provide a malicious MDB file to a system using the vulnerable version of mdbtools. This could be through user interaction (opening a malicious file) or through a service processing user-provided MDB files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified via an OSS-Fuzz report.
- The issue was present in versions prior to 0.9.3 of mdbtools.
- The vulnerability is fixed in commit `373b7ff4c4daf887269c078407cb1338942c4ea6` and `ab9e4088a9cbcf3e0aa0053437327287e2869756`.
- The affected versions include: v0.9.2, v0.9.2-beta1 to v0.9.2-beta6 and v0.9.3-beta1 to v0.9.3-beta4
- The Gentoo security advisory rates the severity of the vulnerability as low and exploitable remotely.
