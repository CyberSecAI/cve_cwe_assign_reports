# Critic Input for CVE-2022-0185



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
A **heap-based buffer overflow** flaw was found in the way the legacy_parse_param function in the Filesystem Context functionality of the Linux kernel verified the supplied parameters length. An unprivileged (in case of unprivileged user namespaces enabled, otherwise needs namespaced CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege) local user able to open a filesystem that does not support the Filesystem Context API (and thus fallbacks to legacy handling) could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **attacker:** unprivileged local user
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** legacy_parse_param function in Filesystem Context functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An integer underflow in the `legacy_parse_param` function within the Linux kernel's `fs/fs_context.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the heap due to an incorrect size calculation.
- **Incorrect Size Check:** The code attempts to prevent the overflow with the check `if (len > PAGE_SIZE - 2 - size)`. However, `size` is an unsigned integer. If `size` is close to `PAGE_SIZE` (4096), the subtraction results in an integer underflow and a large positive value instead of the expected negative value, bypassing the size check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution in the kernel context.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  By exploiting the overflow, an attacker can gain root privileges.
- **Denial of Service:**  Exploitation may lead to system crashes.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive kernel data can be leaked through out-of-bounds reads.
- **Data Modification:**  Exploitation can allow modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The `fsconfig` syscall can be abused by specifying a crafted string as a parameter to trigger the overflow.
- FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) can be used to create a custom filesystem and control the timing of certain operations, which helps with exploiting the race conditions and heap spraying.
- SYSVIPC message queues are leveraged for heap spraying and memory manipulation.
- Modprobe can be abused for privilege escalation after kernel exploitation.
- Unprivileged users can use `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS|CLONE_NEWUSER)` to create a new namespace with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **CAP_SYS_ADMIN Capability:** The attacker needs the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability, which can be obtained by creating a new user namespace.
- **Knowledge of Kernel Exploitation:** The attacker requires knowledge of kernel exploitation techniques, including heap overflows, race conditions, and ROP (Return-Oriented Programming).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel versions 5.1 and later, up to (but not including) the fix.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `fsconfig` syscall, specifically when setting string parameters.
- The provided content includes details on how the overflow is triggered (via a large size variable causing an underflow in the size check) and how it can be used for privilege escalation using FUSE and SYSVIPC.
- Exploits using both FUSE and pipes were developed to achieve local privilege escalation and container escape.
- The vulnerability was found using the Syzkaller fuzzer.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by multiple file systems which utilize the legacy `fs_context`.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Description:** Pre-design: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)

- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0816:** Integer underflow in firewall via malformed packet.
- **CVE-2004-1002:** Integer underflow by packet with invalid length.
- **CVE-2005-0199:** Long input causes incorrect length calculation.
