# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-43563

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.75 | Pillar | Primary | The vulnerability involves **broken access control** leading to unauthorized access to media files. This is a very general, high-level CWE. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.65 | Base | Secondary | The vulnerability can be viewed as a case of missing authentication for critical functions, but access control is a broader category that better captures the overall issue. |
| CWE-425 | Insufficiently Protected Critical Resources | 0.65 | Base | Secondary | The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.50 | Base | Secondary | The authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**broken access control**" as the **rootcause**, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to download media files. The most appropriate CWE for this is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Although CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, it directly reflects the stated root cause. The Retriever Results suggest CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-425 (Insufficiently Protected Critical Resources) which could be considered secondary weaknesses. However, the provided information does not include specific details of user-controlled keys. Since the attacker is unauthenticated, CWE-306 and CWE-425 could be a better fit but are not as direct as CWE-284. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, highlighting "Broken Access Control allows an unauthenticated attacker to download media files from the DAM system via the `pixx.io API`."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-284 is a Pillar-level CWE. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-425 (Insufficiently Protected Critical Resources) are Base-level CWEs that could potentially be chained together to provide a more comprehensive description, but they aren't as direct as CWE-284 in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Medium evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials. The high-level nature of CWE-284 contributes to slightly lower confidence.)

## Known Examples for CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539): An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26679**: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as "profile pictures." The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.
- **CVE-2021-41847**: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.
- **CVE-2021-22906**: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.
- **CVE-2021-21012**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **CVE-2021-21013**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the customer API module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure and update arbitrary information on another user's account.
- **CVE-2021-21022**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the product module. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
- **CVE-2021-21255**: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- **CVE-2021-24318**: The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.
- **CVE-2021-26024**: The Favorites component before 1.0.2 for Nagios XI 5.8.0 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference: it is possible to create favorites for any other user account.
