- **version:** R01.03.0018
- **component:** RevserveMem component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41415:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ReserveMem` driver within the UEFI firmware of Acer Altos servers. It stems from the incorrect use of the `gRT->GetVariable` service.
- A hardcoded `DataSize` parameter (1827) is significantly larger than the buffer allocated on the stack to store the retrieved variable's value. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Improper use of `gRT->GetVariable` with a hardcoded, oversized buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the UEFI DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase.
- Potential for a malicious code to be installed that can survive OS reboots by modifying NVRAM area in SPI flash storage.
- The attacker can control the RIP (instruction pointer) and overwrite the return address.

**Attack vectors:**
- Modifying the NVRAM variable `ReserveMemFlag`. This can be done either physically (with access to the server) or remotely if there are vulnerabilities that allow remote NVRAM modification.
- Setting the variable to a large string that exceeds the allocated stack buffer, causing a buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify NVRAM variables of the target system, either physically or remotely.
- Technical knowledge to craft shellcode and exploit the stack buffer overflow.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific Acer Altos server models (Altos W2000h-W570h F4) with firmware version released on 2019.02.13.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `sub_32C` function located at offset `0x32c` within the `ReserveMem` driver.
- The exploit uses a `nsh` script to set the `ReserveMemFlag` variable to a long string of 'A's, which overwrites the return address on the stack.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary code by hijacking control flow and printing a string to the console.

The content from `acer.com` and `altos.com` is irrelevant to the vulnerability, and the github content provides full details of the vulnerability.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **stack overflow** in the RevserveMem component of Acer Altos W2000h-W570h F4 R01.03.0018. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms a stack-based buffer overflow due to the incorrect use of `gRT->GetVariable` with a hardcoded `DataSize` parameter larger than the allocated buffer on the stack. This directly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant level CWE and preferred over the Class-level CWE-119. The attack involves injecting crafted shellcode into the NVRAM variable, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by overwriting the return address on the stack and executing arbitrary code. The MITRE mapping guidance ALLOWS CWE-121 for stack-based buffer overflows.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
