# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-177 | Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding) | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an **authentication bypass** can be achieved by using URL encoding of the '.' (dot) character. This allows an unauthenticated user to access all functionalities. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) directly addresses the scenario where authentication is bypassed via an alternate channel. The vulnerability description indicates that by manipulating the URL (the alternate channel), an attacker can circumvent the normal authentication process. The retriever results give CWE-288 the highest score, and the usage is "Allowed" for this CWE, as it's at the Base level of abstraction.
  - The vulnerability also involves **improper handling of URL encoding**. The vulnerability description indicates that the **authentication bypass** is achieved via the URL encoding of the '.' (dot) character. CWE-177 (Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding)) is a variant of **improper handling of URL encoding**, which is a contributing factor. While the primary issue is the **authentication bypass**, the encoding issue enables it, which makes CWE-177 a secondary candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-288 is related to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) because bypassing authentication essentially means a critical function is being accessed without proper authentication. However, CWE-288 is more specific as it highlights the use of an alternate path/channel for the bypass. CWE-177 is a child of CWE-172 (Improper Handling of URL Encoding) and could CanPrecede CWE-289.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from technical description, retriever results, and CWE descriptions)

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0317** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0317](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0317): Protection mechanism that restricts URL access can be bypassed using URL encoding.
- **CVE-2004-0847** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0847): Bypass of authentication for files using "\" (backslash) or "%5C" (encoded backslash).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-34746**: A vulnerability in the TACACS+ authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) feature of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and log in to an affected device as an administrator. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of user-supplied input that is passed to an authentication script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting parameters into an authentication request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and log in as an administrator to the affected device.
- **CVE-2022-4722**: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness in GitHub repository ikus060/rdiffweb prior to 2.5.5.
- **CVE-2022-23317**: CobaltStrike <=4.5 HTTP(S) listener does not determine whether the request URL begins with "/", and attackers can obtain relevant information by specifying the URL.
