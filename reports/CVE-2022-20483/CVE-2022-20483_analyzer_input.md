# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-20483

## Vulnerability Description
In several functions that parse avrc response in avrc_pars_ct.cc and related files, there are possible **out of bounds reads** due to **integer overflows**. This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID A-242459126

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflows**
- **weakness:** **out of bounds reads**
- **impact:** remote information disclosure
- **product:** Android
- **version:** 10 and 11 and 12 and 12L and 13
- **component:** several functions that parse avrc response in avrc_pars_ct.cc and related files

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when parsing AVRCP response due to the use of 16-bit min_len, which was changed to 32-bits to avoid the overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure due to possible length checking overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "Parsing of AVRCP responses.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted AVRCP response.",
  "Additional details": "The fix also changes memory allocation from malloc to calloc to ensure that string memory in list items is properly cleaned up by the caller."
