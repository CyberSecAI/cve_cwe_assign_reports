# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-23613

## Vulnerability Description
xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In affected versions an **integer underflow** leading to a **heap overflow** in the sesman server allows any unauthenticated attacker which is able to locally access a sesman server to execute code as root. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.18.1 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.

- **component:** sesman server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23613

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow in the `sesman_data_in` function of the xrdp-sesman server. This underflow occurs when validating the size of the incoming data, leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Integer Underflow (CWE-191):** The size check `if (size < HEADER_SIZE || size > self->in_s->size)` is vulnerable to integer underflow. When a small size is provided such that `size < HEADER_SIZE`, the check can become true even when the size is negative or very large.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The integer underflow leads to `self->header_size` being set to a very large value, causing a heap overflow when data is processed using this size, because it bypasses the size check and then copies too much data to the allocated buffer.
*   **Improper Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-130, CWE-839):** There's improper calculation of the buffer size due to the integer underflow. The code doesn't correctly handle the case where a small or negative value is passed as the size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the sesman server to achieve root code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the sesman server, which by default listens on localhost, but may be configured for remote access.
*   **Malicious RDP Client:** An attacker can use a malicious or crafted RDP client to send a specially crafted message to the sesman server, triggering the integer underflow and subsequent heap overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target sesman server.
*   **Low Privileges:** No specific privileges are required, as the vulnerability occurs before authentication takes place.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required. The attacker simply needs to send the malicious message to the vulnerable server.
*   **Local Attack Vector** Although the sesman server might listen only locally, it is still labeled as "local attack vector" in the CVSS v3 metrics. This does not mean the attack is limited to only local attackers. This "local" designation is because the vulnerability does not exist in the client software used to connect, but on the service running locally.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in xrdp versions 0.9.17 and 0.9.18.
*   The fix is included in versions 0.9.18.1 or 0.9.19 and above.
*   The patch adds a lower bound check to the size validation `if (size < HEADER_SIZE || size > self->in_s->size)` to prevent an integer underflow, so now it explicitly checks `if (size < HEADER_SIZE)` instead of implicitly assuming the size cannot be a small number.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gilad Kleinman.

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root, making it a serious security concern.
