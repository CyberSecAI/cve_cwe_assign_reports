# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-23613

## Query
xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In affected versions an integer underflow leading to a heap overflow in the sesman server allows any unauthenticated attacker which is able to locally access a sesman server to execute code as root. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.18.1 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: integer underflow
- **weakness**: heap overflow
