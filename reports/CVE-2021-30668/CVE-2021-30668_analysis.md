# Analysis for CVE-2021-30668

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-807 | Reliance on Obsolete Input | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability allows a person with physical access to bypass the Login Window during a software update, indicating an **authentication bypass**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates a **logic issue in Software Update** leading to improper state management. This aligns with CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel), as the software update process provides an alternate channel that bypasses the normal login authentication. The "Usage: Allowed" for CWE-288 supports this mapping.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-288 is a Base level CWE which makes it preferable. CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) is a child of CWE-288, but is not a good fit since the bypass is not happening through an alternate hardware interface.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of authentication bypass and supporting details.)

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-807 (Reliance on Obsolete Input) is a possible secondary candidate since the **logic issue in Software Update** and **improper state management during software updates** may stem from relying on input that can be modified by an untrusted actor (someone with physical access).
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-807 is a base level CWE. The description of the **vulnerability** mentions that person with physical access to Mac can **bypass login window**, therefore, a malicious user is able to modify the input.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence as it is less direct than CWE-288 but still relevant given the details.)
