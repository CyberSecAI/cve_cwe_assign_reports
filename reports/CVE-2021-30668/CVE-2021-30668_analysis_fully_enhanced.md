# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-30668

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-807 | Reliance on Obsolete Input | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability allows a person with physical access to bypass the Login Window during a software update, indicating an **authentication bypass**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates a **logic issue in Software Update** leading to improper state management. This aligns with CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel), as the software update process provides an alternate channel that bypasses the normal login authentication. The "Usage: Allowed" for CWE-288 supports this mapping.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-288 is a Base level CWE which makes it preferable. CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) is a child of CWE-288, but is not a good fit since the bypass is not happening through an alternate hardware interface.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of authentication bypass and supporting details.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-807 (Reliance on Obsolete Input) is a possible secondary candidate since the **logic issue in Software Update** and **improper state management during software updates** may stem from relying on input that can be modified by an untrusted actor (someone with physical access).
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-807 is a base level CWE. The description of the **vulnerability** mentions that person with physical access to Mac can **bypass login window**, therefore, a malicious user is able to modify the input.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence as it is less direct than CWE-288 but still relevant given the details.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-20565**: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.4.0.0, 1.5.0.0, 1.5.0.1, 1.6.0.0, and 1.6.0.1 uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism. IBM X-Force ID: 199236.
- **CVE-2021-36777**: A Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision vulnerability in the login proxy of the openSUSE Build service allowed attackers to present users with a expected login form that then sends the clear text credentials to an attacker specified server. This issue affects: openSUSE Build service login-proxy-scripts versions prior to dc000cdfe9b9b715fb92195b1a57559362f689ef.
- **CVE-2021-4314**: It is possible to manipulate the JWT token without the knowledge of the JWT secret and authenticate without valid JWT token as any user. This is happening only in the situation when zOSMF doesn’t have the APAR PH12143 applied. This issue affects: 1.16 versions to 1.19. What happens is that the services using the ZAAS client or the API ML API to query will be deceived into believing the information in the JWT token is valid when it isn’t. It’s possible to use this to persuade the southbound service that different user is authenticated.
- **CVE-2022-23654**: Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. In affected versions an authenticated user with write access on a restricted set of paths can update a page outside the allowed paths by specifying a different target page ID while keeping the path intact. The access control incorrectly check the path access against the user-provided values instead of the actual path associated to the page ID. Commit https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/411802ec2f654bb5ed1126c307575b81e2361c6b fixes this vulnerability by checking access control on the path associated with the page ID instead of the user-provided value. When the path is different than the current value, a second access control check is then performed on the user-provided path before the move operation.
- **CVE-2022-29518**: Screen Creator Advance2, HMI GC-A2 series, and Real time remote monitoring and control tool Screen Creator Advance2 versions prior to Ver.0.1.1.3 Build01, HMI GC-A2 series(GC-A22W-CW, GC-A24W-C(W), GC-A26W-C(W), GC-A24, GC-A24-M, GC-A25, GC-A26, and GC-A26-J2), and Real time remote monitoring and control tool(Remote GC) allows a local attacker to bypass authentication due to the improper check for the Remote control setting's account names. This may allow attacker who can access the HMI from Real time remote monitoring and control tool may perform arbitrary operations on the HMI. As a result, the information stored in the HMI may be disclosed, deleted or altered, and/or the equipment may be illegally operated via the HMI.
