# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Information Exposure | 0.70 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**missing permission check**" in `updateNotification` of `BeamTransferManager.java`, leading to "local **information disclosure** of paired Bluetooth addresses." The CVE reference links confirm this, highlighting the **lack of access control** as the root cause. Specifically, any application could listen to a broadcast and obtain Bluetooth addresses due to the **missing permission check**. This is a clear case of CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) because the component is broadcasting information that requires permission to access. The default permission level is incorrectly set, resulting in information disclosure. While CWE-200 (Information Exposure) is a broader category, the **missing permission check** causing the exposure makes CWE-276 a more specific and accurate fit. The MITRE guidance allows CWE-276, and it directly addresses the root cause, not just the symptom.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-276 is a Base level weakness, which is a preferred level. CWE-276 is related to CWE-200, but describes the root cause of the problem, whereas CWE-200 describes the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-276 is a child of CWE-732, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-43037**: An issue was discovered in Kaseya Unitrends Backup Appliance before 10.5.5. The Unitrends Windows agent was vulnerable to DLL injection and binary planting due to insecure default permissions. This allowed privilege escalation from an unprivileged user to SYSTEM.
- **CVE-2020-9451**: An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe keeps a log in a folder where unprivileged users have write permissions. The logs are generated in a predictable pattern, allowing an unprivileged user to create a hardlink from a (not yet created) log file to anti_ransomware_service.exe. On reboot, this forces the anti_ransomware_service to try to write its log into its own process, crashing in a SHARING VIOLATION. This crash occurs on every reboot.
- **CVE-2021-31540**: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.5 (in a default installation) has incorrect file permissions of configuration files in the conf/ directory. A regular local user is able to read and write to all the configuration files, e.g., modify the application server configuration.
