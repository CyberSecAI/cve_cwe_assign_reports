# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-36239

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability stems from a **missing authentication vulnerability** for the Ehcache RMI network service, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. |
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | The **deserialization** vulnerability is a direct consequence of the missing authentication, allowing attackers to inject malicious serialized objects. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The primary weakness is the **missing authentication vulnerability** (CWE-306) for the Ehcache RMI network service. This allows attackers to connect to the service without any form of identity verification. The CVE description and the Retriever Results both strongly support this. The vulnerability description states 'attackers, who can connect to the service, on port 40001 and potentially 40011, could execute arbitrary code of their choice in Jira through deserialization due to a **missing authentication vulnerability**.' The Retriever results show that CWE-306 has the highest score with 0.8735. The description aligns directly with CWE-306, as it highlights the absence of authentication for critical functionality. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-306 indicates this is ALLOWED for cases where authentication is missing for critical functions."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-306 is a base-level CWE. It's related to authentication bypass issues. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent, CWE-306 is more specific, indicating the complete absence of authentication rather than a flawed implementation. CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication) is also related, but less relevant as the issue isn't about key exchange, but a total lack of authentication. CWE-613 is related as the lack of authentication may improve the likely success of certain attacks."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) is a secondary weakness. Because there is **missing authentication**, the attacker is able to exploit a deserialization vulnerability. The vulnerability description indicates that attackers can execute arbitrary code of their choice in Jira through deserialization. The retriever score is 0.6074. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-502 indicates this is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-502 is a base-level CWE. It's related to weaknesses like CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')) and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) because the attacker is able to inject code."
- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-25985**: In Factor (App Framework & Headless CMS) v1.0.4 to v1.8.30, improperly invalidate a user’s session even after the user logs out of the application. In addition, user sessions are stored in the browser’s local storage, which by default does not have an expiration time. This makes it possible for an attacker to steal and reuse the cookies using techniques such as XSS attacks, followed by a local account takeover.
- **CVE-2021-31408**: Authentication.logout() helper in com.vaadin:flow-client versions 5.0.0 prior to 6.0.0 (Vaadin 18), and 6.0.0 through 6.0.4 (Vaadin 19.0.0 through 19.0.3) uses incorrect HTTP method, which, in combination with Spring Security CSRF protection, allows local attackers to access Fusion endpoints after the user attempted to log out.
- **CVE-2021-3183**: Files.com Fat Client 3.3.6 allows authentication bypass because the client continues to have access after a logout and a removal of a login profile.
- **CVE-2021-20378**: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.2 and 4.0.0.4 does not invalidate session after logout which could allow an authenticated user to impersonate another user on the system. IBM X-Force ID: 195709.
- **CVE-2021-3144**: In SaltStack Salt before 3002.5, eauth tokens can be used once after expiration. (They might be used to run command against the salt master or minions.)
- **CVE-2020-18701**: Incorrect Access Control in Lin-CMS-Flask v0.1.1 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and/or gain privileges due to the application not invalidating a user's authentication token upon logout, which allows for replaying packets.
- **CVE-2021-22820**: A CWE-614 Insufficient Session Expiration vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to maintain an unauthorized access over a hijacked session to the charger station web server even after the legitimate user account holder has changed his password. Affected Products: EVlink City EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 (All versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.2 ), EVlink Parking EVW2 / EVF2 / EVP2PE (All versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.2), and EVlink Smart Wallbox EVB1A (All versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.2)
- **CVE-2022-24895**: Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. When authenticating users Symfony by default regenerates the session ID upon login, but preserves the rest of session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enables same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation. This issue has been fixed in the 4.4 branch. 
- **CVE-2022-43844**: IBM Robotic Process Automation for Cloud Pak 20.12 through 21.0.3 is vulnerable to broken access control. A user is not correctly redirected to the platform log out screen when logging out of IBM RPA for Cloud Pak. IBM X-Force ID: 239081.
- **CVE-2022-30277**: BD Synapsys™, versions 4.20, 4.20 SR1, and 4.30, contain an insufficient session expiration vulnerability. If exploited, threat actors may be able to access, modify or delete sensitive information, including electronic protected health information (ePHI), protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII).
