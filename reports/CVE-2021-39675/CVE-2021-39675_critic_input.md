## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" which directly corresponds to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). This is further supported by the "**out of bounds write**" which aligns with the nature of buffer overflows. The CVE reference summary strengthens this by detailing a "tag mismatch" that can lead to privilege escalation by manipulating NFC frames, indicating a potential overflow scenario where data is written beyond the allocated buffer size. CWE-122 is a Variant level CWE, providing sufficient specificity.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of a buffer overflow. Although not explicitly stated, it is related to the broader category of memory corruption vulnerabilities. It can lead to other issues like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) or CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) if the overflow leads to reading from unauthorized memory locations or if an incorrect size is used for allocation following the overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Primary CWE:* Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference details.)
  - *Secondary CWEs:* Confidence: 0.70 (The heap overflow could result in an out-of-bounds read, as well as allocation issues.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Description:** Pre-design: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476
CanFollow -> CWE-1284
CanFollow -> CWE-129

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Perform adequate input validation against any value that influences the amount of memory that is allocated. Define an appropriate strategy for handling requests that exceed the limit, and consider supporting a configuration option so that the administrator can extend the amount of memory to be used if necessary.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Operation
- **Description:** Run your program using system-provided resource limits for memory. This might still cause the program to crash or exit, but the impact to the rest of the system will be minimized.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
OOB read: Shorthand for "Out of bounds" read

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
