# Critic Input for CVE-2021-33393



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
lfs/backup in IPFire 2.25-core155 does not ensure that /var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl is owned by the root account. It might be owned by an unprivileged account, which could potentially be used to install a Trojan horse backup.pl script that is later executed by root. Similar problems with the ownership/permissions of other files may be present as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **ownership of /var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl is not checked**
- **impact:** execute Trojan horse backup.pl script
- **attacker:** unprivileged account
- **product:** IPFire
- **version:** 2.25-core155
- **component:** lfs/backup

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure file permissions and ownership of the `/var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl` script in IPFire. The script was initially owned by the `nobody` user, which allowed any process running as `nobody` to overwrite the script with arbitrary content. Since this script is later executed, this could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness was the write access granted to the `nobody` user on the `backup.pl` script, leading to an exploitable condition.
*   **Code Injection:** By overwriting the script, an attacker could inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could achieve remote code execution on the IPFire system by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While the script initially runs with the privileges of `nobody`, the attacker can write code that escalates to `root`.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Web Interface Access:** An authenticated attacker can install a malicious package, triggering the execution of the backup script through the web interface.
2.  **File Overwrite:** By leveraging the write permissions of the `nobody` user, the attacker overwrites the `backup.pl` script with malicious code.
3.  **Script Execution:** The system runs the modified backup script, executing the attacker's injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log into the IPFire web interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the IPFire system through the network.
*   **Web Interface Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to install packages to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in IPFire version 2.25, core update 156.
*   A fix was implemented to change the ownership of `/var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl` to `root:root` to prevent unauthorized modification.
*   The provided commit `6769d909306d7bdc43d64598872126fcf1b217f6` addresses the vulnerability.
*   The attacker can leverage the vulnerability to gain a root shell by injecting a malicious script that calls `setuid(0)`.
*   The exploit relies on the fact that the backup script is executed with elevated privileges after the user logs in and installs a package, even though it is run as the 'nobody' user.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **rootcause** is the "**ownership of /var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl is not checked**." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability stems from the insecure file permissions and ownership of the `/var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl` script. The script was initially owned by the `nobody` user, which allowed unauthorized modification. This aligns precisely with CWE-708 (Incorrect Ownership Assignment), which describes a scenario where the product assigns an owner to a resource, but the owner is outside of the intended control sphere. Here, the intended owner should be `root`, but it was incorrectly assigned to `nobody`. MITRE mapping guidance states that CWE-708 is ALLOWED and at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships for CWE-708 were found, but considering the context, the insecure ownership allows for a **code injection vulnerability** (as described in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary), where an attacker can overwrite the script and inject malicious code. While not a direct relationship, it helps understand the impact chain.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While CWE-708 captures the primary **rootcause** of incorrect ownership, CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is a secondary consideration. The vulnerability description mentions that similar problems with the ownership/permissions of other files may be present. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights the insecure file permissions, indicating that the write access granted to the `nobody` user on the `backup.pl` script was a critical factor. Although the core issue is incorrect ownership, the permissive file permissions contribute to the overall vulnerability. CWE-276 is ALLOWED and at the Base level of abstraction, making it suitable for this secondary mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships for CWE-276 were found. However, insecure permissions (CWE-276) often lead to vulnerabilities such as **code injection** and **privilege escalation**, as seen in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. This suggests a potential chain of events where incorrect permissions facilitate further exploitation.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Sufficient evidence to indicate it's a contributing factor, but not the primary cause)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-43037**: An issue was discovered in Kaseya Unitrends Backup Appliance before 10.5.5. The Unitrends Windows agent was vulnerable to DLL injection and binary planting due to insecure default permissions. This allowed privilege escalation from an unprivileged user to SYSTEM.
- **CVE-2020-9451**: An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe keeps a log in a folder where unprivileged users have write permissions. The logs are generated in a predictable pattern, allowing an unprivileged user to create a hardlink from a (not yet created) log file to anti_ransomware_service.exe. On reboot, this forces the anti_ransomware_service to try to write its log into its own process, crashing in a SHARING VIOLATION. This crash occurs on every reboot.
- **CVE-2021-31540**: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.5 (in a default installation) has incorrect file permissions of configuration files in the conf/ directory. A regular local user is able to read and write to all the configuration files, e.g., modify the application server configuration.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** The architecture needs to access and modification attributes for files to only those users who actually require those actions.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.
