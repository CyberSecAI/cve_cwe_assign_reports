# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-33393

## Query
lfs/backup in IPFire 2.25-core155 does not ensure that /var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl is owned by the root account. It might be owned by an unprivileged account, which could potentially be used to install a Trojan horse backup.pl script that is later executed by root. Similar problems with the ownership/permissions of other files may be present as well.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: ownership of /var/ipfire/backup/bin/backup.pl is not checked
