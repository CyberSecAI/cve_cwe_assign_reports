# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-26117

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-258 | Empty Password in Configuration File | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves an **empty password in configuration file** [CWE-258] for the MySQL root account in FortiNAC. This allows an authenticated attacker with local access to connect to the database without authentication via the CLI. The **root cause** is the **empty password**, leading to unauthorized database access. CWE-258 (Empty Password in Configuration File) is a Variant-level CWE that directly addresses this issue. The retriever results also give CWE-258 the highest score and the description precisely matches the vulnerability. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-258 indicates this is ALLOWED. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is a possible secondary candidate because an empty password is a type of credential, but CWE-258 is more specific.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-258 does not have any direct relationships in the provided information. It is a variant and is directly related to the **root cause** of the **empty password**.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)
