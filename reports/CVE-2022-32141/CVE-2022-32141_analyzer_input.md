# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-32141

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple CODESYS Products are prone to a **buffer over read**. A low privileged remote attacker may craft a request with an invalid offset, which can cause an internal buffer over-read, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. User interaction is not required.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer over read**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** craft a request with an invalid offset
- **attacker:** low privileged remote attacker
- **product:** CODESYS Products

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A crafted request with invalid offsets causes an internal buffer over-read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based, crafted requests sent to the CODESYS Control V2 runtime system's communication server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated on the controller, or no level 1 online password is set. Low skill level is required.
