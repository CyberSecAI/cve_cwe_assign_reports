## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-4062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the BFCache (Back/Forward Cache) component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap, potentially corrupting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the user's system. This would allow them to take control of the browser and potentially the entire system.
- Denial of Service: Exploiting the heap buffer overflow could also lead to a crash of the browser or even the system, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the BFCache, which is used when navigating back and forth through browsing history.
- A malicious website could be designed to exploit the heap buffer overflow when the browser attempts to use the BFCache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious website or inject malicious code into an existing website.
- The victim needs to visit the malicious website (or the website with injected code) using a vulnerable version of Chromium.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Leecraso and Guang Gong of 360 Alpha Lab.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Chromium version 96.0.4664.93 and later versions.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- The vulnerability is also present in other Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
