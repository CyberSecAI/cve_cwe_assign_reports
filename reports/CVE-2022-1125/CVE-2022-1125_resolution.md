# Final Resolution for CVE-2022-1125

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the potential for **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))** to **CANPRECEDE** **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**. While the vulnerability description directly points to a **use-after-free**, the criticism correctly notes the potential for a race condition to contribute to this **weakness**. The abstraction levels also played a role; **CWE-416** is a Variant, which is generally preferred, while **CWE-362** is a Class, suggesting the possibility of more specific children. However, without more information, **CWE-362** is an acceptable secondary classification.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts potentially with **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))**, where multiple threads access a shared resource without proper synchronization. This **weakness** can lead to a scenario where memory is freed by one thread while another thread is still accessing it, resulting in **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**. The final impact is potential heap corruption, as stated in the vulnerability description.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** as the primary **weakness**, which is supported by the explicit mention of "use after free" in the vulnerability description: "Use after free in Portals in Google Chrome prior to 100.0.4896.60 allowed a remote attacker... to potentially exploit heap corruption via user interaction." The criticism highlighted the potential for other contributing factors, specifically **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))**, which can **CANPRECEDE** **CWE-416**. While there isn't enough evidence to definitively confirm a race condition, it is a plausible contributing factor given the concurrent nature of the Portals feature in Chrome. Therefore, **CWE-362** is included as a secondary **weakness**. The confidence score is lowered to 0.8 due to the uncertainty regarding the presence of a race condition. The selection of **CWE-416** and **CWE-362** reflects the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence, with **CWE-416** directly describing the observed **weakness** and **CWE-362** representing a potential contributing factor.
