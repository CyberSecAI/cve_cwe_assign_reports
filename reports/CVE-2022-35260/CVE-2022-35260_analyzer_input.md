# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-35260

## Vulnerability Description
curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **off-by-one error**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** custom netrc file
- **attacker:** malicious user
- **product:** curl
