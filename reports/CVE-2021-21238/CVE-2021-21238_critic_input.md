# Critic Input for CVE-2021-21238



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an **improper verification of cryptographic signature** vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of **XML Signature wrapping** because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper verification of cryptographic signature**
- **weakness:** **XML Signature wrapping**
- **impact:** process invalid XML documents
- **product:** PySAML2
- **version:** before 6.5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21238:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the lack of XML schema validation in `pysaml2` when processing SAML documents. Specifically, the `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend, which is the default, does not validate the SAML document against an XML schema before verifying its signature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing XML Schema Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper XML schema validation before signature verification. This allows an attacker to craft malicious XML documents that appear to have valid signatures due to `xmlsec1` only validating the first signature it finds within a given scope.
- **Inadequate Signature Verification:** The underlying `xmlsec1` library does not validate every signature within the entire document, but only the first one it encounters in the given scope.
- **XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) Attack:** The vulnerability allows for XML Signature Wrapping attacks, where a valid signature is placed within a malformed part of the XML document, and because the schema isn't validated, this malformed document will be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Signature Verification:** An attacker can bypass signature verification by including the signature in a malformed part of the XML.
- **Authentication Bypass/Spoofing:** By crafting a malicious SAML response, the attacker can potentially bypass authentication or impersonate a legitimate user.
- **Potential for privilege escalation**: A successful attack could grant the attacker unauthorized access or higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SAML Documents:** An attacker crafts an XML document that contains a valid signature but has a malformed structure that bypasses the validation logic. This could be done either in a SAML request or response.
- **Interception and Modification of SAML Exchanges:** An attacker could intercept a legitimate SAML message, modify its structure, and insert the valid signature, and thus send the crafted, malicious SAML document to the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft XML:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed XML document.
- **Network Position:** The attacker either needs to be in a position to intercept and modify SAML messages, or be able to send a crafted SAML document to the target.
- **Knowledge of SAML and XML:** The attacker must understand the structure of SAML documents and the mechanisms used for signature verification in SAML.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `pysaml2` versions <= 6.4.1
- The fix is included in version 6.5.0, where XML schema validation was implemented before signature verification.
- The fix involved adding numerous XML schema files for SAML and related extensions.
- There was a commit that specifically addressed this vulnerability with the message "Validate XML documents before verifying the signature".
- The advisory was published by `c00kiemon5ter` on January 20, 2021.
- The advisory is listed as High severity.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**improper verification of cryptographic signature**" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by detailing the lack of XML schema validation, leading to the acceptance of invalidly signed SAML documents. This aligns directly with CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature), which describes a product's failure to properly verify the cryptographic signature of data. The security implication is that an attacker can bypass authentication or impersonate a user, as noted in the CVE summary. The Retriever Results also identifies CWE-347 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0246. The MITRE mapping guidance designates the usage of CWE-347 as ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-347 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. There are no direct relationships listed in the provided information.

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that the **weakness** is due to "**XML Signature wrapping** because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the lack of XML Schema validation is the key enabler of the XML Signature Wrapping attack. This aligns with CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation), where the product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema. By not validating against the schema, the application is vulnerable to processing a wrapped signature, which means the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** is possible. The Retriever Results identifies CWE-112 as a possible candidate with a score of 0.7562. The MITRE mapping guidance designates the usage of CWE-112 as ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-112 is a base CWE, and the retriever results provides several other CWEs that are children of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), and CWE-112 is one of the parents.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results for CWE-347).
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results for CWE-112).

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21405**: Lotus is an Implementation of the Filecoin protocol written in Go. BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: "serialized", and "compressed", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.
- **CVE-2020-23533**: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.
- **CVE-2021-0152**: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.
- **CVE-2021-21238**: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
- **CVE-2021-21239**: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
- **CVE-2021-22708**: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Always validate XML input against a known XML Schema or DTD.


It is not possible for an XML parser to validate all aspects of a document's content because a parser cannot understand the complete semantics of the data. However, a parser can do a complete and thorough job of checking the document's structure and therefore guarantee to the code that processes the document that the content is well-formed.







## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

### Extended Description


Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.


Input validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)


Input validation can be applied to:


  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.

  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size

Data can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.

Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:


  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.

  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size

  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures

  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.

  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax 

  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token

  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)

  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.

  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic 

  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same

  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data

Implied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. 

Note that "input validation" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.


Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name "O'Reilly" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the "'" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity
- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset
- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness
- CWE-1287: Specified Type
- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input
- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence
- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Consider using language-theoretic security (LangSec) techniques that characterize inputs using a formal language and build "recognizers" for that language. This effectively requires parsing to be a distinct layer that effectively enforces a boundary between raw input and internal data representations, instead of allowing parser code to be scattered throughout the program, where it could be subject to errors or inconsistencies that create weaknesses. [REF-1109] [REF-1110] [REF-1111]

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** Use an input validation framework such as Struts or the OWASP ESAPI Validation API. Note that using a framework does not automatically address all input validation problems; be mindful of weaknesses that could arise from misusing the framework itself (CWE-1173).

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

CWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.


**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.

**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.

**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.

**[Terminology]** 

The "input validation" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.


Some people use "input validation" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean "checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it." CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.
