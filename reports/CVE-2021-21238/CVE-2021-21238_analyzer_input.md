# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21238

## Vulnerability Description
PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an **improper verification of cryptographic signature** vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of **XML Signature wrapping** because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper verification of cryptographic signature**
- **weakness:** **XML Signature wrapping**
- **impact:** process invalid XML documents
- **product:** PySAML2
- **version:** before 6.5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21238:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the lack of XML schema validation in `pysaml2` when processing SAML documents. Specifically, the `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend, which is the default, does not validate the SAML document against an XML schema before verifying its signature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing XML Schema Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper XML schema validation before signature verification. This allows an attacker to craft malicious XML documents that appear to have valid signatures due to `xmlsec1` only validating the first signature it finds within a given scope.
- **Inadequate Signature Verification:** The underlying `xmlsec1` library does not validate every signature within the entire document, but only the first one it encounters in the given scope.
- **XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) Attack:** The vulnerability allows for XML Signature Wrapping attacks, where a valid signature is placed within a malformed part of the XML document, and because the schema isn't validated, this malformed document will be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Signature Verification:** An attacker can bypass signature verification by including the signature in a malformed part of the XML.
- **Authentication Bypass/Spoofing:** By crafting a malicious SAML response, the attacker can potentially bypass authentication or impersonate a legitimate user.
- **Potential for privilege escalation**: A successful attack could grant the attacker unauthorized access or higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SAML Documents:** An attacker crafts an XML document that contains a valid signature but has a malformed structure that bypasses the validation logic. This could be done either in a SAML request or response.
- **Interception and Modification of SAML Exchanges:** An attacker could intercept a legitimate SAML message, modify its structure, and insert the valid signature, and thus send the crafted, malicious SAML document to the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft XML:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed XML document.
- **Network Position:** The attacker either needs to be in a position to intercept and modify SAML messages, or be able to send a crafted SAML document to the target.
- **Knowledge of SAML and XML:** The attacker must understand the structure of SAML documents and the mechanisms used for signature verification in SAML.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `pysaml2` versions <= 6.4.1
- The fix is included in version 6.5.0, where XML schema validation was implemented before signature verification.
- The fix involved adding numerous XML schema files for SAML and related extensions.
- There was a commit that specifically addressed this vulnerability with the message "Validate XML documents before verifying the signature".
- The advisory was published by `c00kiemon5ter` on January 20, 2021.
- The advisory is listed as High severity.
