# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-29582

## Query
In the Linux kernel before 5.17.3, fs/io_uring.c has a use-after-free due to a race condition in io_uring timeouts. This can be triggered by a local user who has no access to any user namespace however, the race condition perhaps can only be exploited infrequently.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: race condition
- **weakness**: use-after-free
