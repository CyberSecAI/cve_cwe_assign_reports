# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Improper Control of Recursion Depth | 0.85 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.6 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **stack overflow** in the `parse_array` function of Cesanta MJS. The CVE reference summary details how deeply nested array structures lead to recursive calls of `parse_array` and `parse_value`, which exhausts the stack. This aligns directly with CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion Depth). CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and while it might be more precise to identify the exact cause of the stack exhaustion, the core issue is the lack of control over recursion depth. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-674 is Allowed-with-Review since it's a Class.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While the direct relationships of CWE-674 are limited, the vulnerability's nature suggests a potential chain where uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674) leads to resource exhaustion, specifically a stack overflow. There are no direct relationships to explore.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The ASAN output shows that the stack overflow happens in `__asan_memcpy`, which is called by `mjs_mk_string`. This reveals a secondary weakness, a stack-based buffer overflow, since `memcpy` is writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack. This aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The Retriever Results lists CWE-121 as a candidate, and its mapping guidance is Allowed.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While the primary weakness is the uncontrolled recursion, the buffer overflow contributes to the denial of service.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Sufficient evidence to support the presence of CWE-121 as a secondary contributing factor)
