### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **default password**
- **product:** Open5GS
- **version:** 2.1.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the default configuration of the `webui` component of Open5GS. Specifically:

1.  **Default Binding to 0.0.0.0:** The webui server, by default, binds to `0.0.0.0:3000`. This means that the control panel is accessible from any IP address, including the public internet (WAN), if the server is exposed without proper network restrictions.
2.  **Default Credentials:** If no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The combination of listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and a default, weak, hardcoded password creates a significant security risk.
*   **Exposure of Management Interface:** The webui control panel, intended for management, is exposed to potentially unauthorized users due to the default configuration.
*   **Reliance on Default Credentials:** The automatic creation of a default admin user with a well-known password allows for easy exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Takeover:** An attacker who can access the webui interface can log in using the default credentials and gain full administrative control of the Open5GS instance.
*   **Data Breach and Manipulation:** This could lead to unauthorized access to network configuration, data modification, and potentially denial of service.
*   **Compromise of Network:** Full control over the Open5GS instance could compromise the entire network it is managing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exposure:** The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can reach the exposed port 3000 of the Open5GS server. This could include:
    *   **Direct WAN Access:** If the server is directly connected to the internet without firewall or network address translation (NAT).
    *   **LAN Access:** If an attacker is present in the same local network as the vulnerable Open5GS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the webui interface on port 3000.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must be aware of the default username (`admin`) and password (`1423`). This information is available in the source code.

**Mitigation:**

The issue was mitigated with the following changes:

*   **Production mode:** In production mode, the server no longer creates the default admin/1423 account.
*   **WebUI Installation script:** The installation script now creates a default admin account if none exists during setup.
*   **Bind to localhost:** The webui was changed to use `localhost` by default.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the open5gs webui if the service was exposed to the internet, due to the default listening address and creation of a default admin user with a weak password.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that Open5GS 2.1.3 uses a **default password** of "1423" for the admin account. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating, "**Default Credentials:** If no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423"". This aligns directly with CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password), which describes the use of default passwords for potentially critical functionality. The Retriever results also list CWE-1393 as the top candidate with a score of 0.5819, further supporting this classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1393 indicates that this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1393 is a child of CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) and is related to other authentication-related CWEs. While CWE-1392 is a parent class, CWE-1393 is more specific in that it directly involves a default *password*, making it a more appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence and supportive retriever results.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions that if no user accounts are present in the MongoDB database, the webui automatically creates a default administrative account with the username "admin" and password "1423". This suggests that the system doesn't enforce proper authentication mechanisms by default, potentially leading to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While a **default password** is the primary issue, the automatic creation of the admin account without requiring an initial user setup points to a lack of enforced authentication. However, CWE-1393 is more directly applicable and specific.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-306 is a parent of CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication). While CWE-306 is a base level CWE, the primary issue revolves around the presence of default credentials and not necessarily the absence of authentication mechanisms in every scenario. Therefore, while CWE-306 might be a contributing factor, it's not as central as CWE-1393.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence as the evidence supports the presence of a **default password** as the main issue.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
