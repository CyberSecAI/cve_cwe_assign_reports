## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "Exposure of information through directory listing" which is the exact definition of CWE-548 (Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating that the root cause is "An improper configuration of the web server allows for directory listing." and lists "CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing" as a weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-548 indicates that it is ALLOWED and at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# CWE Examples from Database


## Known Examples for CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-20656**: Exposure of information through directory listing in SolarView Compact SV-CPT-MC310 prior to Ver.6.5 allows an authenticated attacker to obtain the information inside the system, such as directories and/or file configurations via unspecified vectors.
- **CVE-2021-20993**: In multiple managed switches by WAGO in different versions the activated directory listing provides an attacker with the index of the resources located inside the directory.
- **CVE-2021-23195**: Fresenius Kabi Vigilant Software Suite (Mastermed Dashboard) version 2.0.1.3 has the option for automated indexing (directory listing) activated. When accessing a directory, a web server delivers its entire content in HTML form. If an index file does not exist and directory listing is enabled, all content of the directory will be displayed, allowing an attacker to identify and access files on the server.
- **CVE-2021-21528**: Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 9.1.0, 9.2.0.x, 9.2.1.x contain an Exposure of Information through Directory Listing vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when upgrading from a previous versions.
- **CVE-2021-45421**: Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 products are affected by information disclosure via directory listing. A potential attacker can use this misconfiguration to access all the files in the remote directories. Note: the product has not been supported since 2018 and should be removed or replaced
- **CVE-2022-2558**: The Simple Job Board WordPress plugin before 2.10.0 is susceptible to Directory Listing which allows the public listing of uploaded resumes in certain configurations.
- **CVE-2022-30625**: Directory listing is a web server function that displays the directory contents when there is no index file in a specific website directory. A directory listing provides an attacker with the complete index of all the resources located inside of the directory. The specific risks and consequences vary depending on which files are listed and accessible.


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A directory listing is inappropriately exposed, yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers.

### Extended Description
A directory listing provides an attacker with the complete index of all the resources located inside of the directory. The specific risks and consequences vary depending on which files are listed and accessible.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-497

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, System Configuration
- **Description:** Recommendations include restricting access to important directories or files by adopting a need to know requirement for both the document and server root, and turning off features such as Automatic Directory Listings that could expose private files and provide information that could be utilized by an attacker when formulating or conducting an attack.
