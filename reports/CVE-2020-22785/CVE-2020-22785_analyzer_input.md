# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-22785

## Vulnerability Description
Etherpad < 1.8.3 is affected by a **missing lock check** which could cause a denial of service. Aggressively targeting random pad import endpoints with empty data would flatten all pads due to lack of rate limiting and missing ownership check.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing lock check**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** aggressively targeting random pad import endpoints with empty data
- **product:** Etherpad
- **version:** < 1.8.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The pull request addresses multiple issues related to import/export functionality in Etherpad-lite, focusing on rate limiting, maximum file size, and author session requirements for imports. The core of the vulnerability, if any, comes from the lack of these limitations before the changes introduced in this pull request. Specifically, before these changes, there was:

*   No rate limiting on import/export requests, potentially leading to denial-of-service by overloading the server with requests.
*   No maximum file size limit on imports, which could lead to resource exhaustion on the server or other issues from excessively large files.
*   No check to ensure that the user performing the import was actually a participant (author) on the pad, possibly allowing unauthorized imports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of rate limiting**: The absence of rate limiting on import/export endpoints allowed a large number of requests from a single IP, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
*   **Unbounded file import size**: Not having a maximum file size limit could lead to the server consuming excessive resources (disk space or memory) when processing very large files, causing performance issues and possible service interruptions.
*   **Unauthenticated import**: The lack of session checking to ensure the user is an author on the pad could lead to unauthorized users importing content into pads, which could cause content manipulation or other malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: By exploiting the lack of rate limiting, an attacker could flood the server with import/export requests, making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Resource exhaustion**: Uploading very large files could overwhelm server resources causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Unauthorized content manipulation**: Exploiting the lack of authorization checks for imports could result in unauthorized content modification by injecting content on the pad.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network based**: Attacker can exploit the lack of rate limiting and the missing file size limits by sending requests via HTTP.
*   **Web UI**: Attacker might be able to exploit the missing author session checks through the web browser by sending requests through the import functionality of the web interface, potentially even without a session on the pad.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access**: Attacker needs to have network access to reach the Etherpad-lite server.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the server, or have access to a web browser.

**Additional Details:**
This content provides additional details that are not present in a typical CVE description.
*   The pull request introduces the concept of an "author session," which must be present to allow import functionality. This check prevents users not present on a pad from importing content.
*   The fix introduces configuration settings for the max import file size (importMaxFileSize) and rate-limiting (importExportRateLimiting, IMPORT_EXPORT_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW, IMPORT_EXPORT_MAX_REQ_PER_IP).
*   The pull request includes the removal of test files that were not working properly, with plans to address these tests in the future, especially author session handling tests.
*   The changes are introduced as part of Etherpad version 1.8.3.
*   The `requireAuthorSessionToImport` configuration setting was removed, and the check for author sessions is always enabled.

In summary, this pull request addresses multiple issues related to import/export functionality, introducing rate-limiting, file size limits, and session checks. These changes are security improvements, hardening the system against DoS and unauthorized modification attacks by limiting abuse of import/export features.
