|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.9 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the root cause, which directly aligns with CWE-416 (Use After Free). The CVE reference further confirms "**Use after free** in WebApp Provider" as the weakness. This CWE describes a condition where memory is reused or referenced after it has been freed, potentially leading to **heap corruption**, as also noted in the vulnerability description. The attack vector involves specific UI interactions, which is relevant context but doesn't change the core weakness. The retriever results list CWE-416 with a high score, further supporting this choice.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It is related to resource management errors. While other CWEs such as CWE-415 (Double Free) or CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) are related to memory management issues, the explicit mention of "use after free" makes CWE-416 the most specific and appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
