### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **attacker:** unauthenticated users
- **product:** Poll Maker WordPress plugin
- **version:** before 3.4.2
- **component:** ays_finish_poll AJAX action

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ays_finish_poll` AJAX action, allowing unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `answer` parameter in the `ays_finish_poll` AJAX action. This allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, which is a major security flaw.
    *   **Time-Based SQL Injection:** Although the direct results of the SQL query are not revealed, an attacker can use time delays (e.g., with `SLEEP()`) in the injected SQL to exfiltrate data, such as user password hashes, through a timing attack.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (password hashes).
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successfully exploiting SQL injection may allow for further attacks on the website including complete compromise of the site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through the `ays_finish_poll` AJAX action which accepts the `answer` parameter.
    *   The attacker uses a crafted POST request via `jQuery.post` to inject malicious SQL code through the `answer` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.
    *   The attacker needs to obtain a valid nonce, which can be found on a page with a published poll (value of the `ays_finish_poll` hidden input).
    *   The attacker needs to use timing attack techniques to deduce the response from the database as a direct output of the query is not exposed.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker uses the `UNION SELECT` statement to append their malicious query to the original query of the `ays_finish_poll` action.
*   The attacker uses the `SLEEP()` function to introduce time delays.
*   The attacker uses `LIKE` statements with `CHAR()` function, which allows the attacker to create specific patterns and bypass magic quotes.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to use a time-based attack to determine if a user exists or if a user password hash starts with a specific string.
*   The vulnerable code exists within the `poll-maker` plugin version less than `3.4.2`.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly indicates an **SQL injection** vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization in the `ays_finish_poll` AJAX action. This allows unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL queries. The injected queries can be used to extract sensitive data, such as password hashes, using a time-based attack. The **root cause** is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. This aligns directly with CWE-89, which is at the Base level of abstraction and is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance. The vulnerability also exhibits characteristics of CWE-208 because it uses a timing attack to exfiltrate data, making the time difference observable and exploitable.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-89 is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements), as SQL injection is a specific type of improper neutralization. CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) represents the technique used to exploit the SQL injection for data exfiltration.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials for CWE-89)
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Moderate evidence for CWE-208, as the timing attack is a secondary exploitation technique)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.
**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter control-plane syntax from all input.



### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.

- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203
CanPrecede -> CWE-385
CanPrecede -> CWE-327
ParentOf -> CWE-1254

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.



## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, consider using persistence layers such as Hibernate or Enterprise Java Beans, which can provide significant protection against SQL injection if used properly.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Parameterization
- **Description:** 

If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.


Process SQL queries using prepared statements, parameterized queries, or stored procedures. These features should accept parameters or variables and support strong typing. Do not dynamically construct and execute query strings within these features using "exec" or similar functionality, since this may re-introduce the possibility of SQL injection. [REF-867]


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.


Specifically, follow the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. The database users should only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the system indicate that a user can read and modify their own data, then limit their privileges so they cannot read/write others' data. Use the strictest permissions possible on all database objects, such as execute-only for stored procedures.




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields
- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
