# Analysis for CVE-2020-11240

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | The **rootcause** directly describes an incorrect calculation of the buffer size. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | A consequence of the incorrect buffer size calculation. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states that the **ioctl command size was incorrectly set to the size of a pointer and not enough storage is allocated for the copy of the user argument**. This directly points to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size, aligning perfectly with CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size). The **memory corruption** mentioned in the description is a typical consequence of such a miscalculation, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). CWE-131 is chosen as the primary weakness because it represents the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-131 can lead to CWE-787. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The incorrect buffer size calculation (CWE-131) **causes** memory corruption (CWE-787).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (Medium evidence from the vulnerability description and supporting retriever results)
