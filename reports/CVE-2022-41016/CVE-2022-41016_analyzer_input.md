# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41016

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no vpn basic protocol (l2tp|pptp) name WORD server WORD username WORD passsword WORD firmwall (on|off) defroute (on|off) command template.
