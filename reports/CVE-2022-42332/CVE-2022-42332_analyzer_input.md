# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-42332

## Vulnerability Description
x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode **use-after-free** In environments where host assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests, Xen additionally runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.

- **component:** shadow plus log-dirty mode

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-42332:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in Xen's shadow mode, specifically when combined with log-dirty mode for migration or snapshotting. This occurs due to incorrect memory accounting. While the code properly accounts for memory for page tables when establishing new shadows, the memory required by log-dirty mode was not taken into consideration. This leads to a situation where newly created shadow page tables can be freed prematurely, while other parts of the code still expect them to be valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where a memory region is accessed after it has already been released.
- **Insufficient Memory Accounting:** The root cause is the lack of proper accounting of memory needed by the log-dirty infrastructure when allocating memory for shadow page tables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** Guests can trigger a denial of service, crashing the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability has the potential to allow guest VMs to escalate their privileges on the host system. The use-after-free could potentially lead to code execution within the hypervisor.
- **Other Problems:** The advisory also mentions "other problems" which could arise from the vulnerability, but these are not specifically detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Migration or Snapshotting:** The vulnerability is triggered when a guest VM running in shadow mode is being migrated or snapshotted.
- **Shadow Mode:** The guest VM must be running in shadow mode, which is used when Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is not available.
- **x86 Systems:** Only x86 systems are affected.
- **Paravirtualized (PV) guests:** PV guests are vulnerable. HVM or PVH guests are also vulnerable when run with shadow paging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Guest VM Control:** An attacker must have control of a guest VM running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- **Triggering Migration/Snapshot:** The attacker must be able to initiate a migration or snapshot operation of their guest VM.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects all Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards.
*   Mitigations include not using migration/snapshotting, or running HVM/PVH guests only with HAP.
*   Patches have been released to fix the issue.
