| CWE-203 | Information Exposure Through Discrepancy | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an "**out of bounds read**" which directly corresponds to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). This CWE describes a scenario where a product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The description states that this leads to "local **information disclosure**," which is a typical impact of an out-of-bounds read.
  - The retriever results also include CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) and CWE-416 (Use After Free), but the primary description focuses on reading beyond buffer boundaries.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a base-level CWE, providing a suitable level of specificity for this vulnerability. Although there are no direct parent-child relationships explicitly mentioned, understanding that out-of-bounds reads can lead to information disclosure helps solidify the mapping. CWE-125 is related to buffer management issues generally.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Based on the direct mention of "out of bounds read" and the resulting information disclosure.)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The impact of the out-of-bounds read is "local **information disclosure**." This can be further classified as CWE-203 (Information Exposure Through Discrepancy). The out-of-bounds read could expose sensitive information by reading unintended memory locations, thus revealing differences in system behavior based on the accessed data. However, this is secondary to the root cause, which is the out-of-bounds read itself.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-203 is at the Base level of abstraction. It describes a scenario where a product behaves differently or sends different responses, exposing security-relevant information. While this is a potential consequence, it's not the primary **weakness**, and thus assigned as a secondary candidate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.4 (Lower confidence because it's a consequence and not the direct root cause. More information about the specific nature of the information disclosure would increase confidence.)
