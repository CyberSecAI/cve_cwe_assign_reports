# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1004 | Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 0.5 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag for a cookie**, which directly matches the description of CWE-1004, "Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag". The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by stating the **root cause** is the "Lack of httponly" and the **weakness** is "Missing `HttpOnly` flag on a cookie". CWE-1004 is a Variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that the usage is ALLOWED. The description indicates a remote attacker could obtain sensitive information.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1004 does not have any direct relationships. The retriever results also suggest CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) as potential matches.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary candidate because the absence of the `HttpOnly` flag could lead to the cookie being transmitted over an insecure channel, although this is not explicitly stated. However, the primary issue is the missing flag, not necessarily the transmission itself. The vulnerability details suggest a potential attack vector involving the injection of malicious Javascript or XSS. If the cookie is transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS, this would be a more direct fit for CWE-319.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-319 is a Base level CWE. There are no direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Reasonable evidence based on potential for insecure transmission)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) is a potential secondary candidate if the cookies are used in HTTPS session without secure attribute, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session. It is not clear from the description if the Secure attribute is also missing.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-614 is a Variant level CWE. There are no direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Limited evidence, depends on HTTPS session details)



## Known Examples for CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-0462** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0462](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0462): A product does not set the Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session with the product.
- **CVE-2008-3663** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3663](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3663): A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
- **CVE-2008-3662** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3662](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3662): A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
- **CVE-2008-0128** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0128](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0128): A product does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-35236**: The Secure flag is not set in the SSL Cookie of Kiwi Syslog Server 9.7.2 and previous versions. The Secure attribute tells the browser to only send the cookie if the request is being sent over a secure channel such as HTTPS. This will help protect the cookie from being passed over unencrypted requests. If the application can be accessed over both HTTP, there is a potential for the cookie can be sent in clear text.
- **CVE-2021-29883**: IBM Standards Processing Engine (IBM Transformation Extender Advanced 9.0 and 10.0) does not set the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies. Attackers may be able to get the cookie values by sending a http:// link to a user or by planting this link in a site the user goes to. The cookie will be sent to the insecure link and the attacker can then obtain the cookie value by snooping the traffic. IBM X-Force ID: 207090.
- **CVE-2021-38977**: IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager 3.0, 3.0.1, 4.0, and 4.1 does not set the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies. Attackers may be able to get the cookie values by sending a http:// link to a user or by planting this link in a site the user goes to. The cookie will be sent to the insecure link and the attacker can then obtain the cookie value by snooping the traffic. IBM X-Force ID: 212782.
- **CVE-2021-3882**: LedgerSMB does not set the 'Secure' attribute on the session authorization cookie when the client uses HTTPS and the LedgerSMB server is behind a reverse proxy. By tricking a user to use an unencrypted connection (HTTP), an attacker may be able to obtain the authentication data by capturing network traffic. LedgerSMB 1.8 and newer switched from Basic authentication to using cookie authentication with encrypted cookies. Although an attacker can't access the information inside the cookie, nor the password of the user, possession of the cookie is enough to access the application as the user from which the cookie has been obtained. In order for the attacker to obtain the cookie, first of all the server must be configured to respond to unencrypted requests, the attacker must be suitably positioned to eavesdrop on the network traffic between the client and the server *and* the user must be tricked into using unencrypted HTTP traffic. Proper audit control and separation of duties limit Integrity impact of the attack vector. Users of LedgerSMB 1.8 are urged to upgrade to known-fixed versions. Users of LedgerSMB 1.7 or 1.9 are unaffected by this vulnerability and don't need to take action. As a workaround, users may configure their Apache or Nginx reverse proxy to add the Secure attribute at the network boundary instead of relying on LedgerSMB. For Apache, please refer to the 'Header always edit' configuration command in the mod_headers module. For Nginx, please refer to the 'proxy_cookie_flags' configuration command.
- **CVE-2021-29248**: BTCPay Server through 1.0.7.0 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by failure to set the Secure flag for a cookie.
- **CVE-2022-24045**: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo DXR2 (All versions < V01.21.142.5-22), Desigo PXC3 (All versions < V01.21.142.4-18), Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The application, after a successful login, sets the session cookie on the browser via client-side JavaScript code, without applying any security attributes (such as “Secure”, “HttpOnly”, or “SameSite”). Any attempts to browse the application via unencrypted HTTP protocol would lead to the transmission of all his/her session cookies in plaintext through the network. An attacker could then be able to sniff the network and capture sensitive information.
