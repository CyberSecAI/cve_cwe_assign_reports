## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the **root cause**, which directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The description also mentions "**heap corruption**" as a **weakness**, which is a common consequence of use-after-free vulnerabilities. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reiterates "Use after free" as the "Root cause of vulnerability" and "Use after free in Extensions" as "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities". The "Attack vectors" involve a crafted extension, solidifying the attacker's ability to trigger the vulnerability. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-416 as the top match. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). There is no direct parent-child relationship.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The description explicitly mentions the root cause, use after free, and aligns perfectly with CWE-416)
