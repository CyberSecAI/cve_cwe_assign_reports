## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in Animation in Google Chrome... allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the **root cause of vulnerability** is "**Use-after-free** in Animation".
  CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a Variant level CWE that perfectly matches the description: "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed."
  The description mentions **heap corruption**, which is a typical consequence of use-after-free, where freed memory is reallocated and then unexpectedly modified. This confirms the relevance of CWE-416.
  The Retriever Results also lists CWE-416 as the top match with a score of 0.7935.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) could be consequences of memory corruption caused by the use-after-free, CWE-416 directly addresses the root cause. Also, the "Top CWEs" for similar CVE Descriptions lists CWE-416 as the primary match.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The evidence is very strong and directly supports CWE-416)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Memory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.

**Reasons:**

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
