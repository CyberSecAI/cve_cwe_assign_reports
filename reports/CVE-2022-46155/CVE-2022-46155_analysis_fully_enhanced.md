|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-526 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves a **misconfigured build script** that inadvertently bundles the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable into the build output, leading to **exposure of sensitive information**. This aligns well with CWE-526, "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable," because the API key, a sensitive credential, which is stored in the environment variables and included in the build artifact without proper protection. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary explicitly state that the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` environment variable is bundled into the built `airtable.js` file. This is a clear example of storing sensitive information (the API key) in an environment variable and then including it in cleartext in the final product. CWE-526 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-526 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-526 has no direct relationships, but it can be considered a specific case of more general weaknesses related to information exposure. It is related to the broader issue of credentials management and secure coding practices. The environment variable itself is not the problem, but rather the inclusion of its value within the built artifact.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and alignment with CWE characteristics)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-201, "Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data," is a potential secondary candidate because the bundled `airtable.js` file, containing the API key, is essentially "sent" (distributed) to users or systems where it should not be accessible. This aligns with the CWE's description: "The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor." While the primary issue is the storage and inclusion of the API key in the environment variable and build output (CWE-526), the distribution of this output containing the key can be seen as an instance of CWE-201. However, it is the direct consequence of CWE-526, making CWE-526 the root cause. CWE-201 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that CWE-201 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-201 is related to weaknesses like CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) and CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse). The relationship analysis reveals that CWE-212 could be a related weakness because the sensitive information wasn't removed before the build process bundled the environment variable.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence, primarily as a consequence of the primary weakness)



## Known Examples for CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708): Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24226**: In the AccessAlly WordPress plugin before 3.5.7, the file "resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php" responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode is dumping serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.
- **CVE-2021-33687**: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.
- **CVE-2021-3509**: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **CVE-2021-34771**: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.
- **CVE-2021-25122**: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.
- **CVE-2021-0644**: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462
- **CVE-2020-11922**: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
- **CVE-2021-24170**: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.
- **CVE-2021-24585**: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id
