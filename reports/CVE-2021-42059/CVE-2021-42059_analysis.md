# Analysis for CVE-2021-42059

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" in the UEFI DisplayTypeDxe DXE driver, leading to arbitrary code execution. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant-level CWE and thus more specific than its parent CWE-119. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this root cause. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also relevant as it describes the underlying mechanism of a buffer overflow, but CWE-121 is more precise in identifying the location of the overflow (stack). The usage for CWE-121 is "ALLOWED."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a specific type of out-of-bounds write. The relationship analysis reveals that CWE-121 is a more specific child of CWE-119 and a specific instance of CWE-787.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack-based buffer overflow" in the vulnerability description and supporting details in the CVE reference).
