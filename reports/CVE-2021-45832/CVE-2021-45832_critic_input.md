### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Stack-based Buffer Overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **product:** HDF5
- **version:** 1.13.1-1
- **component:** hdf5/src/H5Eint.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to a stack overflow vulnerability in the HDF5 library.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a stack overflow within the `H5E_printf_stack` function. This function is called recursively due to an infinite loop in error handling when processing a specially crafted HDF5 file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Recursive calls to `H5E_printf_stack` and `H5E__push_stack` functions without proper termination conditions.
- The `H5I_inc_ref` function also contributes to the recursive loop.
- The error handling mechanism within the HDF5 library does not correctly handle certain error conditions, leading to uncontrolled stack growth.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A stack overflow, leading to a segmentation fault and program crash.
- Potential for denial-of-service attacks if an attacker can provide a crafted HDF5 file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted HDF5 file. The specific crafted file (`POC6.zip`) was provided within the issue report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted HDF5 file to the vulnerable application.
- No specific user privileges or local access is mentioned, suggesting remote exploitation might be possible if the HDF5 library is used in a network-facing context.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**Stack-based Buffer Overflow**" in HDF5 1.13.1-1 at hdf5/src/H5Eint.c, leading to a Denial of Service. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further elaborates that the vulnerability is triggered by recursive calls to `H5E_printf_stack` and `H5E__push_stack` without proper termination conditions, contributing to uncontrolled stack growth. The primary **rootcause** is the **stack overflow**, and the impact is a denial of service. Given the explicit mention of a stack-based buffer overflow, CWE-121 is the most appropriate primary CWE. The retriever results list CWE-121 as a candidate. The usage for CWE-121 is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Given that the overflow occurs on the stack, the more specific CWE-121 is preferred. The recursive calls may be indicative of CWE-674, which may contribute to the conditions leading to the overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is triggered by recursive calls to the `H5E_printf_stack` and `H5E__push_stack` functions without proper termination conditions. This recursive behavior contributes to the stack overflow. While CWE-121 directly addresses the overflow itself, the lack of control over the recursion is a contributing factor, thus CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion) should be considered. However, CWE-674 is a class-level CWE, so it should be reviewed if a more specific base or variant child CWE is available to describe the uncontrolled recursion.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is related to resource exhaustion and denial of service. It can contribute to conditions that lead to stack overflows. The vulnerability description indicates that the recursive calls are a contributing factor to the stack overflow, suggesting that CWE-674 may be a relevant secondary CWE.
- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Moderate evidence suggesting uncontrolled recursion contributes to the vulnerability)

- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Description:** Increase the stack size.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use

- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.
