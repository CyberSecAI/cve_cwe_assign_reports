# Analysis for CVE-2022-31099

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place, consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that a **stack overflow** occurs when parsing untrusted rulex expressions with several hundred levels of nesting, leading to a denial-of-service. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is due to **uncontrolled recursion** in the rulex parsing logic. The provided information specifically highlights the lack of a recursion limit. This aligns directly with CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), which describes a situation where a product does not properly control the amount of recursion, consuming excessive resources. The fix involved adding a recursion limit, further supporting this classification.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE. While it might have more specific Base-level children, the provided information does not give enough details to determine a more specific CWE. The Retriever Results also list CWE-674 with a high score, further indicating its relevance. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-674 is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW, which is appropriate given its Class level.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of stack overflow caused by uncontrolled recursion, clear root cause and fix description.)
