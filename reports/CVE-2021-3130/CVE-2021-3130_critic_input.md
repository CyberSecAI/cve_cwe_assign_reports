## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The web interface of Open-AudIT uses HTML password fields to "obfuscate" sensitive credentials like SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings. This method relies on client-side obfuscation rather than proper server-side protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insufficient Credential Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the inadequate protection of sensitive credentials. Hiding these credentials using HTML password fields is a weak form of obfuscation.
-   **Client-Side Security Flaw:** The vulnerability exists because the security relies on client-side mechanisms that can be easily bypassed using browser developer tools.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker can easily reveal stored credentials (SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings) by inspecting the HTML source or using browser developer tools.
-   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials could then be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote Access:** The attack is remote as it exploits a web interface vulnerability.
-   **Browser Manipulation:** Attackers leverage web browser developer tools to bypass the client-side obfuscation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to Open-AudIT Web Interface:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of the vulnerable Open-AudIT instance.
-   **Basic Web Development/Browser Skills:** The attacker must be able to use browser developer tools or inspect HTML source code to reveal the credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Open-AudIT up to version 4.0.2
- The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor
- The affected product is Open-AudIT by Opmantek.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass client-side security and access sensitive credentials stored within the application, which could result in significant security breaches if not addressed.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description indicates that the application uses HTML password field obfuscation to **hide SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings**. This approach is a form of security through obscurity, as it relies on concealing the data rather than employing robust cryptographic protection. The **weakness** lies in the fact that this obfuscation can be easily bypassed using developer tools, which aligns with CWE-656's description. The vulnerability's details match the characteristics of CWE-656, which describes a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity. The security implication is that an attacker can easily reveal the sensitive data. While other CWEs like CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) might seem relevant, the primary issue is the reliance on a weak obfuscation method which is a type of security through obscurity. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-656 indicates that it's ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW because it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-656 is a Class-level CWE, and its children could offer more specific mappings. It is related to weaknesses such as CWE-603 (Use of Client-Side Authentication) because both involve inadequate security mechanisms. The CWE-656 CanPrecede CWE-472 (External Control of Critical State Data) since reliance on obscurity may lead to an attacker controlling sensitive data. The exposure of the credentials could then be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources, potentially leading to further compromise."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials, aligning with the principle of security through obscurity.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.

### Extended Description
This reliance on "security through obscurity" can produce resultant weaknesses if an attacker is able to reverse engineer the inner workings of the mechanism. Note that obscurity can be one small part of defense in depth, since it can create more work for an attacker; however, it is a significant risk if used as the primary means of protection.

Never Assuming your secrets are safe

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-657
ChildOf -> CWE-693
CanPrecede -> CWE-259
CanPrecede -> CWE-321
CanPrecede -> CWE-472

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Always consider whether knowledge of your code or design is sufficient to break it. Reverse engineering is a highly successful discipline, and financially feasible for motivated adversaries. Black-box techniques are established for binary analysis of executables that use obfuscation, runtime analysis of proprietary protocols, inferring file formats, and others.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** When available, use publicly-vetted algorithms and procedures, as these are more likely to undergo more extensive security analysis and testing. This is especially the case with encryption and authentication.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Note that there is a close relationship between this weakness and CWE-603 (Use of Client-Side Authentication). If developers do not believe that a user can reverse engineer a client, then they are more likely to choose client-side authentication in the belief that it is safe.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-6588:** Reliance on hidden form fields in a web application. Many web application vulnerabilities exist because the developer did not consider that "hidden" form fields can be processed using a modified client.
- **CVE-2006-7142:** Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.
- **CVE-2005-4002:** Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.



## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-522

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Avoid storing passwords in easily accessible locations.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider storing cryptographic hashes of passwords as an alternative to storing in plaintext.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Effectiveness:** None
- **Description:** A programmer might attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password because the encoding can be detected and decoded easily.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.



### Alternative Terms
None

ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-344

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.

**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.
- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.
- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.



## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.

### Extended Description
Client-side authentication is extremely weak and may be breached easily. Any attacker may read the source code and reverse-engineer the authentication mechanism to access parts of the application which would otherwise be protected.

### Alternative Terms
None
