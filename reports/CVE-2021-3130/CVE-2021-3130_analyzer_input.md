# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3130

## Vulnerability Description
Within the Open-AudIT up to version 3.5.3 application, the web interface hides SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings from users using HTML password field obfuscation. By using Developer tools or similar, it is possible to change the obfuscation so that the credentials are visible.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **hide SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings**
- **impact:** view the credentials
- **vector:** Developer tools or similar
- **product:** Open-AudIT
- **version:** up to version 3.5.3
- **component:** web interface

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The web interface of Open-AudIT uses HTML password fields to "obfuscate" sensitive credentials like SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings. This method relies on client-side obfuscation rather than proper server-side protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insufficient Credential Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the inadequate protection of sensitive credentials. Hiding these credentials using HTML password fields is a weak form of obfuscation.
-   **Client-Side Security Flaw:** The vulnerability exists because the security relies on client-side mechanisms that can be easily bypassed using browser developer tools.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker can easily reveal stored credentials (SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings) by inspecting the HTML source or using browser developer tools.
-   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials could then be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote Access:** The attack is remote as it exploits a web interface vulnerability.
-   **Browser Manipulation:** Attackers leverage web browser developer tools to bypass the client-side obfuscation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to Open-AudIT Web Interface:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of the vulnerable Open-AudIT instance.
-   **Basic Web Development/Browser Skills:** The attacker must be able to use browser developer tools or inspect HTML source code to reveal the credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Open-AudIT up to version 4.0.2
- The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor
- The affected product is Open-AudIT by Opmantek.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass client-side security and access sensitive credentials stored within the application, which could result in significant security breaches if not addressed.
