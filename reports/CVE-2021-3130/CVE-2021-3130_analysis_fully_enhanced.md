|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-656 | Reliance on Security Through Obscurity | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description indicates that the application uses HTML password field obfuscation to **hide SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings**. This approach is a form of security through obscurity, as it relies on concealing the data rather than employing robust cryptographic protection. The **weakness** lies in the fact that this obfuscation can be easily bypassed using developer tools, which aligns with CWE-656's description. The vulnerability's details match the characteristics of CWE-656, which describes a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity. The security implication is that an attacker can easily reveal the sensitive data. While other CWEs like CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) might seem relevant, the primary issue is the reliance on a weak obfuscation method which is a type of security through obscurity. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-656 indicates that it's ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW because it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-656 is a Class-level CWE, and its children could offer more specific mappings. It is related to weaknesses such as CWE-603 (Use of Client-Side Authentication) because both involve inadequate security mechanisms. The CWE-656 CanPrecede CWE-472 (External Control of Critical State Data) since reliance on obscurity may lead to an attacker controlling sensitive data. The exposure of the credentials could then be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources, potentially leading to further compromise."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials, aligning with the principle of security through obscurity.)



## Known Examples for CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-6588** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6588](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6588): Reliance on hidden form fields in a web application. Many web application vulnerabilities exist because the developer did not consider that "hidden" form fields can be processed using a modified client.
- **CVE-2006-7142** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-7142](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-7142): Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.
- **CVE-2005-4002** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4002](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4002): Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.
- **CVE-2006-4068** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4068): Hard-coded hashed values for username and password contained in client-side script, allowing brute-force offline attacks.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-3130**: Within the Open-AudIT up to version 3.5.3 application, the web interface hides SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings from users using HTML 'password field' obfuscation. By using Developer tools or similar, it is possible to change the obfuscation so that the credentials are visible.


## Known Examples for CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30275](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30275): Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1126**: A vulnerability in the storage of proxy server credentials of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view credentials for a configured proxy server. The vulnerability is due to clear-text storage and weak permissions of related configuration files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of the affected software and viewing the contents of the affected files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials that are used to access the proxy server.
- **CVE-2021-41023**: A unprotected storage of credentials in Fortinet FortiSIEM Windows Agent version 4.1.4 and below allows an authenticated user to disclosure agent password due to plaintext credential storage in log files
- **CVE-2021-1589**: A vulnerability in the disaster recovery feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials. This vulnerability exists because access to API endpoints is not properly restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials that could be used in further attacks.
- **CVE-2021-41297**: ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to weak access control mechanism allowing authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.
