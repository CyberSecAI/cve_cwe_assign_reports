- **product:** Go
- **version:** before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7
- **component:** go get command

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `go` command, when handling packages that use `cgo`, was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution during build time. This occurred because `cgo`, when invoked by `go get` or similar commands, would search for the host C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`) in the directory of the package being built, instead of relying on the system's PATH. This vulnerability was particularly exploitable on Windows systems, which by default search the current directory before directories listed in the PATH.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure PATH lookup in `cgo`:** The `cgo` tool, when invoked from a directory with untrusted content, would perform a PATH lookup that could lead to running a malicious compiler (e.g., `gcc.exe`) located in the current directory instead of the intended system compiler.
*   **Implicit search of the current directory on Windows:** Windows systems automatically search the current directory for executables before consulting the system's PATH, making them more vulnerable to this type of attack.
*   **Lack of full path specification for host compiler:** The `go` command did not pass the full path to the host C compiler to `cgo`, which made `cgo` to perform PATH lookups itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could craft a malicious Go package that uses `cgo` and includes a fake compiler executable (`gcc.exe`). When a user builds this package with `go get` or a similar command, the attacker's `gcc.exe` will be executed, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Go Packages:** The attack vector involves distributing a crafted malicious package that uses `cgo` and includes a malicious executable within its directory.
*   **`go get` or other build commands:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to download and build the malicious package using the `go get` command or similar commands, in Windows systems, or in Unix systems where the current directory is included in the user's PATH.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Distribute Go Packages:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute malicious Go packages that use `cgo` and include malicious executables within the package's directory.
*   **Target User Conditions:** The target user must be using a vulnerable version of Go and be on Windows system or a Unix system that has the current directory (".") in their PATH, and perform build operations on the malicious package.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability was reported by RyotaK, and the Go project has addressed it in Go versions 1.15.7 and 1.14.14.
*  The vulnerability could be triggered by other build commands, not only `go get`, but all that involves `cgo` usage.
* Go versions prior to 1.14.14 and 1.15.x prior to 1.15.7 are susceptible to this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability is not exploitable in common scenarios on Unix due to the absence of "." in the PATH.
* The fix includes passing the full host C compiler path to `cgo` and preventing the usage of executables from the current directory (".") during PATH lookups in `cgo`, `go` and other related tools.

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability enables execution of OS commands via unsanitized user input passed to a system call. |
| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability is caused by the application searching for executables in an uncontrolled directory, leading to the execution of malicious executables. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that it is a **command injection** vulnerability in Go versions before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7 on Windows. The vulnerability occurs when using the `go get` command to fetch modules that make use of `cgo`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides evidence that `cgo` searches for the host C compiler (e.g., `gcc.exe`) in the directory of the package being built, instead of relying on the system's PATH. On Windows, this leads to the execution of a malicious compiler if present in the current directory. This aligns directly with **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))** because the system executes OS commands based on externally influenced input without proper neutralization. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-78 having the highest combined score. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-78 states that it is ALLOWED for OS command injection vulnerabilities.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Command Injection) and is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). The graph relationships show CWE-78 CanPrecede CWE-269 (Privilege Management) since command injection often leads to privilege escalation. While CWE-77 is a parent weakness, the details about system commands make CWE-78 more specific and appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves the `cgo` tool searching for the host compiler in the current directory, instead of relying on the system's PATH. This behavior allows an attacker to place a malicious executable in the current directory, which will then be executed when `go get` is used. This aligns with **CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element)** because the application uses a search path that includes locations under the control of unintended actors (the current directory). The retriever results support this, with CWE-427 being a high scorer. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-427 states that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-427 has no direct relationships to CWE-78, but it represents a contributing factor that enables the **command injection** vulnerability. It describes how the application's use of an uncontrolled search path allows the malicious executable to be found and executed. It is a secondary weakness that facilitates the primary CWE-78.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Sufficient evidence from CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description


Many protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.


### Alternative Terms
Command injection: an attack-oriented phrase for this weakness. Note: often used when "OS command injection" (CWE-78) was intended.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ChildOf -> CWE-74
ParentOf -> CWE-1427
ParentOf -> CWE-624
ParentOf -> CWE-78
ParentOf -> CWE-88
ParentOf -> CWE-917

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Ensure that the analysis focuses on the root-cause error that allows the execution of commands, as there are many weaknesses that can lead to this consequence. See Terminology Notes. If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-78: OS Command Injection


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If at all possible, use library calls rather than external processes to recreate the desired functionality.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If possible, ensure that all external commands called from the program are statically created.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

The "command injection" phrase carries different meanings, either as an attack or as a technical impact. The most common usage of "command injection" refers to the more-accurate OS command injection (CWE-78), but there are many command languages.


In vulnerability-focused analysis, the phrase may refer to any situation in which the adversary can execute commands of their own choosing, i.e., the focus is on the risk and/or technical impact of exploitation. Many proof-of-concept exploits focus on the ability to execute commands and may emphasize "command injection." However, there are dozens of weaknesses that can allow execution of commands. That is, the ability to execute commands could be resultant from another weakness.


To some, "command injection" can include cases in which the functionality intentionally allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed. In this case, the root cause weakness might be related to missing or incorrect authorization, since an adversary should not be able to specify arbitrary commands, but some users or admins are allowed.


CWE-77 and its descendants are specifically focused on behaviors in which the product is intentionally building a command to execute, and the adversary can inject separators into the command or otherwise change the command being executed.


**[Other]** 

Command injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1509:** injection of sed script syntax ("sed injection")
- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.
- **CVE-2020-11698:** anti-spam product allows injection of SNMP commands into confiuration file



## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

### Extended Description


Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as "/tmp" or the current working directory.


In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:


  - the directory from which the program has been loaded

  - the current working directory

In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.

One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.


In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.


In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.


### Alternative Terms
DLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Binary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Insecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Dependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a "substitution attack."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Hard-code the search path to a set of known-safe values (such as system directories), or only allow them to be specified by the administrator in a configuration file. Do not allow these settings to be modified by an external party. Be careful to avoid related weaknesses such as CWE-426 and CWE-428.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When invoking other programs, specify those programs using fully-qualified pathnames. While this is an effective approach, code that uses fully-qualified pathnames might not be portable to other systems that do not use the same pathnames. The portability can be improved by locating the full-qualified paths in a centralized, easily-modifiable location within the source code, and having the code refer to these paths.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Remove or restrict all environment settings before invoking other programs. This includes the PATH environment variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and other settings that identify the location of code libraries, and any application-specific search paths.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).

**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.
- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious "..exe" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH
- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

- **Description:** Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter control-plane syntax from all input.



### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.

## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction:** Class

ParentOf -> CWE-274
ParentOf -> CWE-648

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** Consider following the principle of separation of privilege. Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting access to a system resource.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.



## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description


This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.


There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:


  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system("nslookup [HOSTNAME]") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.

  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use "exec([COMMAND])" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.

From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If at all possible, use library calls rather than external processes to recreate the desired functionality.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Strategy:** Sandbox or Jail
- **Description:** 

Run the code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.


OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.


This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.


Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** For any data that will be used to generate a command to be executed, keep as much of that data out of external control as possible. For example, in web applications, this may require storing the data locally in the session's state instead of sending it out to the client in a hidden form field.



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** The "OS command injection" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an "-exec" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX "find" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.

**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.



### Observed Examples
