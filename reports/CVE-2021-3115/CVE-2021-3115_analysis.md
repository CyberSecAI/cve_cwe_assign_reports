# Analysis for CVE-2021-3115

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability enables execution of OS commands via unsanitized user input passed to a system call. |
| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability is caused by the application searching for executables in an uncontrolled directory, leading to the execution of malicious executables. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that it is a **command injection** vulnerability in Go versions before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7 on Windows. The vulnerability occurs when using the `go get` command to fetch modules that make use of `cgo`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides evidence that `cgo` searches for the host C compiler (e.g., `gcc.exe`) in the directory of the package being built, instead of relying on the system's PATH. On Windows, this leads to the execution of a malicious compiler if present in the current directory. This aligns directly with **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))** because the system executes OS commands based on externally influenced input without proper neutralization. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-78 having the highest combined score. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-78 states that it is ALLOWED for OS command injection vulnerabilities.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Command Injection) and is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). The graph relationships show CWE-78 CanPrecede CWE-269 (Privilege Management) since command injection often leads to privilege escalation. While CWE-77 is a parent weakness, the details about system commands make CWE-78 more specific and appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability involves the `cgo` tool searching for the host compiler in the current directory, instead of relying on the system's PATH. This behavior allows an attacker to place a malicious executable in the current directory, which will then be executed when `go get` is used. This aligns with **CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element)** because the application uses a search path that includes locations under the control of unintended actors (the current directory). The retriever results support this, with CWE-427 being a high scorer. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-427 states that it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-427 has no direct relationships to CWE-78, but it represents a contributing factor that enables the **command injection** vulnerability. It describes how the application's use of an uncontrolled search path allows the malicious executable to be found and executed. It is a secondary weakness that facilitates the primary CWE-78.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Sufficient evidence from CVE reference materials)
