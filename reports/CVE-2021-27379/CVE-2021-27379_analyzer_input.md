# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-27379

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to achieve unintended read/write DMA access, and possibly cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or gain privileges. This occurs because a backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct. NOTE this issue exists because of an **incomplete fix** for CVE-2020-15565.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incomplete fix**
- **impact:** read/write DMA access and denial of service and privilege escalation
- **attacker:** x86 Intel HVM guest OS users
- **product:** Xen
- **version:** through 4.11.x

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
An oversight during the backporting of a fix for XSA-321 resulted in IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) entries not being properly updated in certain scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the improper flushing or updating of IOMMU entries. This allows a malicious guest to retain DMA (Direct Memory Access) to memory frames even after those frames have been returned to the hypervisor's free pool.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest can retain read/write DMA access to frames that are supposed to be free.
- This can lead to the guest reading or writing to memory that is being used for a different purpose by another guest or the hypervisor itself.
- Host crashes, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS), are possible.
- Privilege escalation by the malicious guest cannot be ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have control of a guest operating system that meets the following conditions:
    - Running on x86 Intel architecture.
    - Using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP).
    - Having a passed-through PCI device assigned.
    - Having page table sharing enabled. (Note: Page table sharing is enabled by default when Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible)
-  The guest must be able to manipulate memory in a way to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- The attacker must be able to exploit the flaw in the Xen hypervisor to manipulate IOMMU entries.

**Vulnerable Systems:**
- Xen versions up to 4.11, starting from at least version 3.2, are affected.
- Xen versions 4.12 and newer are not affected.
- Only x86 Intel systems are affected; x86 AMD and Arm systems are not vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Disable page table sharing by using the command line option `iommu=no-sharept`.
- Disable the use of large HAP pages with `hap_2mb=no hap_1gb=no`.
- Avoid passing through PCI devices to HVM guests.
