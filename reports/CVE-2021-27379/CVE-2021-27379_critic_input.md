# Critic Input for CVE-2021-27379



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to achieve unintended read/write DMA access, and possibly cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or gain privileges. This occurs because a backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct. NOTE this issue exists because of an **incomplete fix** for CVE-2020-15565.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incomplete fix**
- **impact:** read/write DMA access and denial of service and privilege escalation
- **attacker:** x86 Intel HVM guest OS users
- **product:** Xen
- **version:** through 4.11.x

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
An oversight during the backporting of a fix for XSA-321 resulted in IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) entries not being properly updated in certain scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the improper flushing or updating of IOMMU entries. This allows a malicious guest to retain DMA (Direct Memory Access) to memory frames even after those frames have been returned to the hypervisor's free pool.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest can retain read/write DMA access to frames that are supposed to be free.
- This can lead to the guest reading or writing to memory that is being used for a different purpose by another guest or the hypervisor itself.
- Host crashes, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS), are possible.
- Privilege escalation by the malicious guest cannot be ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have control of a guest operating system that meets the following conditions:
    - Running on x86 Intel architecture.
    - Using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP).
    - Having a passed-through PCI device assigned.
    - Having page table sharing enabled. (Note: Page table sharing is enabled by default when Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible)
-  The guest must be able to manipulate memory in a way to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- The attacker must be able to exploit the flaw in the Xen hypervisor to manipulate IOMMU entries.

**Vulnerable Systems:**
- Xen versions up to 4.11, starting from at least version 3.2, are affected.
- Xen versions 4.12 and newer are not affected.
- Only x86 Intel systems are affected; x86 AMD and Arm systems are not vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Disable page table sharing by using the command line option `iommu=no-sharept`.
- Disable the use of large HAP pages with `hap_2mb=no hap_1gb=no`.
- Avoid passing through PCI devices to HVM guests.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability stems from an **incomplete fix** for CVE-2020-15565, leading to improper IOMMU updates in Xen. This results in inconsistencies between the hypervisor's memory management and the DMA access granted to guest OSes. The **root cause** is that the backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct. This fits CWE-1250 (Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State) because the IOMMU and the hypervisor's memory map are independent representations of memory state that must remain consistent. The failure to properly update the IOMMU entries leads to a state where the guest OS retains DMA access to memory that has been returned to the free pool, creating an inconsistency."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-1250 is a base level CWE which aligns well with the granularity of the vulnerability. While other CWEs like CWE-367 (TOCTOU Race Condition) and CWE-362 (Race Condition) are related to concurrency issues, CWE-1250 focuses specifically on the consistency of shared state representations, which is the more precise weakness in this scenario. Because the vulnerability lies in synchronizing the DMA translations of guest memory, it doesn't appear that a race condition in the general sense is the primary issue here. CWE-1250 is chosen as the primary weakness, reflecting the lack of consistency in memory management."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the CVE description and reference summary pointing to a lack of consistent state management, rather than just a basic race condition)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ParentOf -> CWE-363
CanFollow -> CWE-609

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** The most basic advice for TOCTOU vulnerabilities is to not perform a check before the use. This does not resolve the underlying issue of the execution of a function on a resource whose state and identity cannot be assured, but it does help to limit the false sense of security given by the check.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When the file being altered is owned by the current user and group, set the effective gid and uid to that of the current user and group when executing this statement.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Limit the interleaving of operations on files from multiple processes.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.



## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** In languages that support it, use synchronization primitives. Only wrap these around critical code to minimize the impact on performance.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use thread-safe capabilities such as the data access abstraction in Spring.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Minimize the usage of shared resources in order to remove as much complexity as possible from the control flow and to reduce the likelihood of unexpected conditions occurring.


Additionally, this will minimize the amount of synchronization necessary and may even help to reduce the likelihood of a denial of service where an attacker may be able to repeatedly trigger a critical section (CWE-400).




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-1250: Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product has or supports multiple distributed components or sub-systems that are each required to keep their own local copy of shared data - such as state or cache - but the product does not ensure that all local copies remain consistent with each other.

### Extended Description


In highly distributed environments, or on systems with distinct physical components that operate independently, there is often a need for each component to store and update its own local copy of key data such as state or cache, so that all components have the same "view" of the overall system and operate in a coordinated fashion. For example, users of a social media service or a massively multiplayer online game might be using their own personal computers while also interacting with different physical hosts in a globally distributed service, but all participants must be able to have the same "view" of the world. Alternately, a processor's Memory Management Unit (MMU) might have "shadow" MMUs to distribute its workload, and all shadow MMUs are expected to have the same accessible ranges of memory.


In such environments, it becomes critical for the product to ensure that this "shared state" is consistently modified across all distributed systems. If state is not consistently maintained across all systems, then critical transactions might take place out of order, or some users might not get the same data as other users. When this inconsistency affects correctness of operations, it can introduce vulnerabilities in mechanisms that depend on consistent state.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** Issues related to state and cache - creation, preservation, and update - are a significant gap in CWE that is expected to be addressed in future versions. It likely has relationships to concurrency and synchronization, incorrect behavior order, and other areas that already have some coverage in CWE, although the focus has typically been on independent processes on the same operating system - not on independent systems that are all a part of a larger system-of-systems.
