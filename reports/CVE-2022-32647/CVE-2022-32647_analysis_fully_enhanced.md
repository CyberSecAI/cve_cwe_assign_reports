# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.70 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**out of bounds write** due to **improper input validation**." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the **root cause of vulnerability** is "**improper input validation**" and the **weakness** is "**out-of-bounds write**." CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses the core weakness described. While **improper input validation** is listed as the root cause, it is a broad class of errors.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The vulnerability can be viewed as a sequence: Improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of the weakness and root cause in the description and CVE Reference links.)
