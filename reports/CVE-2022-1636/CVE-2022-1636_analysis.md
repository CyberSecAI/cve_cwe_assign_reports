## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in Performance APIs" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms "**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free in Performance APIs." This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes the product reusing memory after it has been freed. The vulnerability can lead to heap corruption as stated in the description, which is a typical consequence of use-after-free conditions. The CWE-416 entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED, providing further support for the selection of this CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of 'use after free' in the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details provides high confidence)
