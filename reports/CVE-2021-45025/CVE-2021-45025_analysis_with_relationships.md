  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** in a Cookie." CWE-315, "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie," directly matches this description.

The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-315 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-315 is a Variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and is more specific. This specificity makes it the most appropriate choice.
