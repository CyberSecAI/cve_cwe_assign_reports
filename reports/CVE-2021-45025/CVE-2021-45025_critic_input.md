## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** in a Cookie." CWE-315, "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie," directly matches this description. The CWE definition and vulnerability description align perfectly, as the sensitive information is stored without encryption within a cookie. This directly exposes the data to potential unauthorized access if the cookie is intercepted or accessed. The retriever results also ranked CWE-315 as the top candidate. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-315 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-315 is a Variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and is more specific. This specificity makes it the most appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-315: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a cookie.

### Extended Description
Attackers can use widely-available tools to view the cookie and read the sensitive information. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-312

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1800:** Admin password in cleartext in a cookie.
- **CVE-2001-1537:** Default configuration has cleartext usernames/passwords in cookie.
- **CVE-2001-1536:** Usernames/passwords in cleartext in cookies.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, System Configuration, Operation
- **Description:** When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to encrypt the data at rest. [REF-1297] [REF-1299] [REF-1301]



### Additional Notes
