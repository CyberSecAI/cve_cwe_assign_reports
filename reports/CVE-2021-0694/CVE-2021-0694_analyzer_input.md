# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-0694

## Vulnerability Description
In setServiceForegroundInnerLocked of ActiveServices.java, there is a possible way for a background application to regain foreground permissions due to **insufficient background restrictions**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-11Android ID A-183147114

{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2021-0694",
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from how foreground services started from the background are handled regarding 'while-in-use' permission access. Previously, the system only checked for the mAllowWhileInUsePermissionInFgs flag at service start via startService() or bindService(). However, after the service starts, a later call to Service.startForeground() might occur when the caller is no longer in the foreground. This allows a service started from the background to gain 'while-in-use' permissions.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient checks for foreground state when calling Service.startForeground() after the initial service start."
      ],
      "Impact": "A background service can gain access to sensitive permissions like location, camera, or microphone, which are intended to be available only while the app is in the foreground.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker can start a service from the background and then call startForeground() to gain elevated permissions even when the service is not in the foreground.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to start a service in the background and then call startForeground()."
    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The provided text details the fix for the vulnerability. The fix includes three main changes: 1. If the first call to Service.startForeground() is more than 10 seconds after the Context.startService() call, the service's app process state will be checked and the mAllowWhileInUsePermissionInFgs flag will be set again. 2. At Service.stopForeground() call, the flag is reset to false. 3.  On subsequent Service.startForeground() calls, the app process state is checked and the flag is set again.",
