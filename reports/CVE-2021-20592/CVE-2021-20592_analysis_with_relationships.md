| CWE-820 | Missing Synchronization | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Missing synchronization** vulnerability...allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause DoS condition...by rapidly and repeatedly connecting and disconnecting...". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is "a lack of proper synchronization when accessing shared resources within the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function" which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-820 (Missing Synchronization): "The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to synchronize access to the resource." The attack vector of rapidly connecting and disconnecting highlights the concurrent access issue. The impact is a DoS, which is a typical consequence of synchronization issues. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-820 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found, but CWE-820 can often lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400) as a consequence, though that isn't the primary weakness here.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary).
