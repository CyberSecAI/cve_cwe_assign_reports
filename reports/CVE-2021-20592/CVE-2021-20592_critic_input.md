## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper synchronization when accessing shared resources within the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function of Mitsubishi Electric's GOT2000 series and GT SoftGOT2000 products. This is identified as CWE-820 (Missing Synchronization).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Synchronization:** The core issue is the absence of proper synchronization mechanisms when multiple connections interact with the shared resources for MODBUS/TCP communication. This can lead to a race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By rapidly and repeatedly connecting to and disconnecting from the MODBUS/TCP communication port, an attacker can disrupt the communication capabilities of the affected devices. This renders the device unable to communicate properly on the network and could disrupt industrial processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the MODBUS/TCP port of the affected GOT devices. This could be from within the local network or potentially remotely if the device is exposed to the internet.
*   **Repeated Connections/Disconnections:** The attack involves sending a high volume of connection and disconnection requests to the MODBUS/TCP port on the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the MODBUS/TCP port on the affected device.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Some understanding of network communication, specifically how MODBUS/TCP works, is likely required to execute the attack effectively.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to authenticate to the device, making it easier to exploit.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   **GOT2000 Series:**
    *   Models: GT27, GT25, GT23
    *   Communication driver versions: 01.19.000 to 01.39.010 (inclusive) when using "MODBUS/TCP Slave, Gateway" communication driver.
*   **GT SoftGOT2000:**
    *   Software versions: 1.170C to 1.256S (inclusive) when configured to use "MODBUS/TCP Slave" communication.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Software Updates:** Mitsubishi Electric has released updated versions of the communication drivers for the GOT2000 series and GT SoftGOT2000 to address the vulnerability. Users are advised to update to the following versions:
    *   GOT2000 series: Communication driver version 01.40.000 or later.
    *   GT SoftGOT2000: Software version 1.260W or later.
*   **Network Security:** It is also recommended to use network security measures like firewalls and VPNs to protect affected devices from unauthorized access. Additionally, restricting network access to only trusted networks and hosts, and using antivirus software, is also advised.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Missing synchronization** vulnerability...allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause DoS condition...by rapidly and repeatedly connecting and disconnecting...". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is "a lack of proper synchronization when accessing shared resources within the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function" which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-820 (Missing Synchronization): "The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to synchronize access to the resource." The attack vector of rapidly connecting and disconnecting highlights the concurrent access issue. The impact is a DoS, which is a typical consequence of synchronization issues. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-820 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found, but CWE-820 can often lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400) as a consequence, though that isn't the primary weakness here.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-820: Missing Synchronization
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to synchronize access to the resource.

### Extended Description
If access to a shared resource is not synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-662
ChildOf -> CWE-662
ChildOf -> CWE-662
ParentOf -> CWE-1096
ParentOf -> CWE-543
ParentOf -> CWE-567

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.





## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664
ParentOf -> CWE-1235
ParentOf -> CWE-1246
ParentOf -> CWE-405
CanFollow -> CWE-410
ParentOf -> CWE-770
ParentOf -> CWE-771
ParentOf -> CWE-779
ParentOf -> CWE-920

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Mitigation of resource exhaustion attacks requires that the target system either:


  - recognizes the attack and denies that user further access for a given amount of time, or

  - uniformly throttles all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed.

The first of these solutions is an issue in itself though, since it may allow attackers to prevent the use of the system by a particular valid user. If the attacker impersonates the valid user, they may be able to prevent the user from accessing the server in question.

The second solution is simply difficult to effectively institute -- and even when properly done, it does not provide a full solution. It simply makes the attack require more resources on the part of the attacker.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale placed on them.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.
