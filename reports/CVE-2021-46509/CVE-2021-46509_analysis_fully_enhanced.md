# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.85 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-674 | Improper Control of Recursion | 0.60 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** in Cesanta MJS v2.20.0 due to an issue within the `snquote` function in `mjs/src/mjs_json.c`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms the **stack overflow** as the **root cause**, caused by crafted JSON strings and leading to a crash. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which describes a condition where a buffer on the stack is overwritten. The attack vector involves crafted JavaScript code which can trigger the vulnerability, thus leading to denial of service. Since the overflow occurs on the stack, CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion) is also a possibility, as the **stack overflow** might be triggered by unbounded recursion in the `snquote` function, and the description mentions "consuming excessive resources...or the program stack."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-674 does not have any direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
