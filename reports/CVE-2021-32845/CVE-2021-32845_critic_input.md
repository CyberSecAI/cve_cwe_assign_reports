# Critic Input for CVE-2021-32845



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov` being uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int) read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len)` when an attacker is able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit 41272a980197917df8e58ff90642d14dec8fe948.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32845:

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-32845 is one of four related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-32843, CVE-2021-32844, CVE-2021-32845, and CVE-2021-32846) affecting the hyperkit virtualization platform. Specifically, CVE-2021-32845 refers to a vulnerability where the `pci_vtrnd_notify` function within the `vtrnd` (Virtio RNG) device driver doesn't properly handle errors from the `vq_getchain` function. This can lead to the use of uninitialized memory, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) or memory corruption on the host.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from a missing check on the return value of the `vq_getchain` function within the `pci_vtrnd_notify` function. If `vq_getchain` fails (e.g., due to no virtio queues being initialized by the guest), it can return a negative value, which is not handled and leads to using an uninitialized `iovec` structure. The code proceeds to use this uninitialized structure in a subsequent read operation, potentially causing a crash or memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory Use:** The primary weakness is the use of an uninitialized `iovec` structure (`iov`). This structure is intended to hold memory addresses for I/O operations, but if `vq_getchain` fails, it isn't properly initialized, leading to undefined behavior.
*   **Missing Error Handling:** The code fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain` which can return negative values on error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the host system, causing a denial of service.
*  **Memory Corruption:** In certain situations, the use of uninitialized memory may lead to memory corruption, which can potentially be exploited further.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest OS:** A compromised guest operating system can trigger the vulnerability. This involves a malicious guest not setting up the `virtio` queues correctly and then sending a notification that would invoke the vulnerable code path.
*   **Specifically, the guest needs to avoid creating the virtio queues that are read by `vq_getchain`, leading to its failure and the use of uninitialized data.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Access:** The attacker must have control over the guest operating system running within the hyperkit virtual machine.
*   **Knowledge of Virtio:** The attacker needs to have some understanding of how `virtio` queues are initialized and used to manipulate the guest to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `vtrnd` device is used to provide randomness to the guest OS. It uses a virtio queue to transfer this data.
*   The vulnerable code resides in the `pci_vtrnd_notify` function in `pci_virtio_rnd.c`.
*   The `vq_getchain` function is used to retrieve the iovec structure describing the memory region that will receive the random data.
*   The `read()` system call uses the uninitialized iovec to read data, leading to the crash.

**Code Snippet:**

```c
static void
pci_vtrnd_notify(void *vsc, struct vqueue_info *vq)
{
  struct iovec iov;
  struct pci_vtrnd_softc *sc;
  int len;
  uint16_t idx;
  
  sc = vsc;
  
  if (sc->vrsc_fd < 0) {
    vq_endchains(vq, 0);
    return;
  }
  
  while (vq_has_descs(vq)) {
    vq_getchain(vq, &idx, &iov, 1, NULL); //Vulnerable line. Return value not checked.
    
    len = (int) read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len); // Uses the possibly uninitialized iov.
    DPRINTF(("vtrnd: vtrnd_notify(): %d\r\n", len));
    
    /* Catastrophe if unable to read from /dev/random */
    assert(len > 0);
    
    /*
    * Release this chain and handle more
    */
    vq_relchain(vq, idx, (uint32_t)len);
  }
  vq_endchains(vq, 1); /* Generate interrupt if appropriate. */
}

```

**Patch:**
The vulnerability was fixed by checking the return value of `vq_getchain` and exiting early if it is negative.

```c
    while (vq_has_descs(vq)) {
        n = vq_getchain(vq, &idx, &iov, 1, NULL);
        if (n < 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "vtrnd: vtrnd_notify(): n %d\r\n", n);
            return;
        }
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept code and build instructions, which further highlight how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The issue was discovered and reported by a member of the GitHub Security Lab (GHSL).
*   The fix is included in the `various-fixes` pull request #313 for the `hyperkit` repository.

In summary, CVE-2021-32845 is a critical vulnerability in `hyperkit` that could lead to host DoS or memory corruption due to a lack of error handling and resulting use of uninitialized data, which could be triggered by a malicious guest.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **rootcause** is that the `pci_vtrnd_notify` function " **fails to check the return value of `vq_getchain`**". This directly corresponds to CWE-252 [Unchecked Return Value], where a product doesn't check the return value from a method or function, potentially missing unexpected states or conditions. The CVE reference summary reinforces this by stating "The vulnerability arises from a missing check on the return value of the `vq_getchain` function". MITRE's mapping guidance for CWE-252 indicates that this is ALLOWED, as it is a Base level of abstraction, making it an appropriate mapping for the root cause.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-252 [Unchecked Return Value] is a Base level CWE. It can precede CWE-476 [NULL Pointer Dereference] because failing to check a return value can lead to a NULL pointer. It has a peer relationship with CWE-394 [Unexpected Status Code or Return Value].

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct statement in vulnerability description.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that a consequence of the missing return value check is that " `struct iovec iov` being **uninitialized**". This directly leads to the use of uninitialized memory, which aligns with CWE-908 [Use of Uninitialized Resource]. The CVE reference summary also highlights "Uninitialized Memory Use: The primary weakness is the use of an uninitialized `iovec` structure (`iov`)." CWE-908 is a Base level CWE with an ALLOWED usage, which makes it a strong candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-908 [Use of Uninitialized Resource] is a Base level CWE. It can follow CWE-252 [Unchecked Return Value] since the missing check on `vq_getchain`'s return value leads to `iov` being uninitialized.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence because the description indicates the variable is uninitialized due to the missing check.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-32846**: HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

### Extended Description
Two common programmer assumptions are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.
