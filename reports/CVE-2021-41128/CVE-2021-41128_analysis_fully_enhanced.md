## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states that the affected application suffers from a **CSV Injection** vulnerability because it does not validate or sanitize formula fields that are exported to CSV files. This perfectly aligns with the description of CWE-1236, which is about improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. The vulnerability allows users to inject malicious formulas that get executed when the exported file is opened by spreadsheet software. The CVE reference links content summary further confirms this by explaining the root cause as the lack of proper sanitization of user-generated input when creating CSV files, and it highlights the possibility of code execution and data exfiltration. The fix involves escaping/encoding formulas, which is also consistent with CWE-1236. The retriever results give this CWE the highest score."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-1236 does not have any direct relationships with other CWEs in the provided data. However, it is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) as it is a specific case of improper neutralization in the context of CSV files. While CWE-74 is a parent weakness, CWE-1236 is more specific and appropriate. CWE-79 and CWE-94 are less relevant because the vulnerability is in the exported file, not a web page or direct code injection."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference content, and retriever results)

- **CVE-2019-4521** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-4521](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-4521): Cloud management product allows arbitrary command execution via CSV injection
- **CVE-2019-17661** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17661](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17661): CSV injection in content management system via formula code in a first or last name
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-41128**: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.
- **CVE-2021-38873**: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 208396.
- **CVE-2021-28829**: The Administration GUI component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux contains an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows a low privileged attacker with network access to execute a persistent CSV injection attack from the affected system. A successful attack using this vulnerability requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.10.2 and below, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1, TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.10.2 and below, and TIBCO Administrator - Enterprise Edition for z/Linux: versions 5.11.0 and 5.11.1.
- **CVE-2021-22035**: VMware vRealize Log Insight (8.x prior to 8.6) contains a CSV(Comma Separated Value) injection vulnerability in interactive analytics export function. An authenticated malicious actor with non-administrative privileges may be able to embed untrusted data prior to exporting a CSV sheet through Log Insight which could be executed in user's environment.
- **CVE-2021-20509**: IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.0 and 7.6.1 is potentially vulnerable to CSV Injection. A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, caused by improper validation of csv file contents. IBM X-Force ID: 198243.
- **CVE-2021-41270**: Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\\t`, `\\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.
- **CVE-2021-41390**: In Ericsson ECM before 18.0, it was observed that Security Provider Endpoint in the User Profile Management Section is vulnerable to CSV Injection.
