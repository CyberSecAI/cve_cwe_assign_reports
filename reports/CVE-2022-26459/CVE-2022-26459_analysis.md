# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an "**integer overflow**" in vow, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read. This aligns directly with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating the root cause is an "**Integer overflow**". The resulting "out of bounds read" is a consequence of the integer overflow, making CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) a secondary weakness. The relationship analysis shows that an integer overflow can precede an out-of-bounds read. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-190 and CWE-125 indicates both are ALLOWED.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 can precede CWE-125.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
