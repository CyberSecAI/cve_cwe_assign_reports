# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3826

## Vulnerability Description
**Heap/stack buffer overflow** in the dlang_lname function in d-demangle.c in libiberty allows attackers to potentially cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and crash) via a crafted mangled symbol.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Heap/stack buffer overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** crafted mangled symbol
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** libiberty
- **component:** dlang_lname function in d-demangle.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3826:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap/stack buffer overflow in the `dlang_lname` function within `d-demangle.c` in the libiberty library. This occurs due to a missing check for a null pointer before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap/stack buffer overflow
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash (SIGSEGV) due to a null pointer dereference.
- Potentially, it could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by overflowing the buffer although this is not explicitly stated in the provided information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted, malformed mangled name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted, malformed mangled name to a tool or library that uses libiberty, specifically the `dlang_lname` function within `d-demangle.c`. No specific position is required, only the ability to provide the malicious input to the vulnerable software.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was patched in `mingw-binutils`, `mingw-gdb`, `insight` and `mingw-gcc`.
- The patch involved adding a check to prevent dereferencing a null reference on `dlang_type`.
- The patch was introduced by Lu√≠s Ferreira and is described as a fix to prevent null dereferencing on a crafted malformed mangled name causing SIGSEGV.
