# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-33719

## Vulnerability Description
**Improper input validation** in baseband prior to SMR Aug-2022 Release 1 allows attackers to cause **integer overflow to heap overflow**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper input validation**
- **weakness:** **integer overflow to heap overflow**
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** baseband
- **version:** prior to SMR Aug-2022 Release 1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the baseband.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can cause a heap overflow by triggering an integer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the baseband.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers can trigger the vulnerability through crafted baseband inputs.
- **Additional details**: The vulnerability is located in the baseband and affects devices with S.LSI CP chipsets. The provided description indicates the vulnerability was fixed by adding proper validation logic to prevent integer overflows, suggesting that the original vulnerability was caused by an insufficient check on incoming data that could cause an arithmetic overflow when processing it, leading to a heap overflow.
