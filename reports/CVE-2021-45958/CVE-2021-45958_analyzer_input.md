# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-45958

## Vulnerability Description
UltraJSON (aka ujson) through 5.1.0 has a **stack-based buffer overflow** in Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked (called from encode). Exploitation can, for example, use a large amount of indentation.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** large amount of indentation
- **product:** UltraJSON (aka ujson)
- **version:** through 5.1.0
- **component:** Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
    "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked` function, which is called during the encoding process.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient buffer size calculations in the `Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked` function."
        ],
        "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service through a segmentation fault caused by writing beyond the allocated stack buffer.",
         "attack_vectors": [
            "The vulnerability is triggered during the encoding process when using a large amount of indentation or very large strings, especially in lists or dictionaries.",
            "The `Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked` function is called from the `encode` function."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the data being encoded, specifically the structure and content of JSON objects (including indentation). No special privileges or user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
    }
