# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-32040

## Vulnerability Description
It may be possible to have an extremely long aggregation pipeline in conjunction with a specific stage/operator and cause a stack overflow due to the size of the stack frames used by that stage. If an attacker could cause such an aggregation to occur, they could maliciously crash MongoDB in a DoS attack. This vulnerability affects MongoDB Server v4.4 versions prior to and including 4.4.28, MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to 5.0.4 and MongoDB Server v4.2 versions prior to 4.2.16. Workaround >= v4.2.16 users and all v4.4 users can add the --setParameter internalPipelineLengthLimit=50 instead of the default 1000 to mongod at startup to prevent a crash.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **extremely long aggregation pipeline, stack overflow**
- **impact:** crash MongoDB
- **product:** MongoDB Server
- **version:** v4.4 prior to and including 4.4.28 and v5.0 prior to 5.0.4 and v4.2 prior to 4.2.16

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32040:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unspecified issue within MongoDB versions prior to 5.0.4, 4.4.11, and 4.2.16. The Jira tickets linked in the NetApp advisory ([SERVER-58203](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-58203), [SERVER-59299](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-59299), [SERVER-60218](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-60218)) indicate improvements to the `$unionWith`, `$match`, and `$group` stages of the aggregation pipeline, which are likely the source of the vulnerability. It appears these stages were not handling certain inputs correctly, which could lead to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the processing logic of the aggregation pipeline stages (`$unionWith`, `$match`, and `$group`). The specific weakness is not detailed, but it involves how these stages handle certain types of queries or data, resulting in excessive resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). This means the MongoDB server could become unresponsive or crash, preventing legitimate users from accessing or using the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending specifically crafted queries to the MongoDB server that utilize the vulnerable aggregation pipeline stages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send queries to the MongoDB server. No authentication or specific privilege level is mentioned in the provided context. It can be inferred that an attacker with the ability to interact with the database can trigger this vulnerability.

**Summary of Information:**

*   The CVE relates to a vulnerability in MongoDB versions prior to 5.0.4, 4.4.11, and 4.2.16.
*   The vulnerability resides in the way specific aggregation pipeline stages (`$unionWith`, `$match`, `$group`) process certain inputs.
*   Exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS).
*   The attack vector involves sending malicious queries utilizing vulnerable pipeline stages.
*   No special privileges are mentioned. It can be inferred that the vulnerability can be exploited with the ability to query the database.
*   NetApp products that incorporate vulnerable versions of MongoDB are also vulnerable.
