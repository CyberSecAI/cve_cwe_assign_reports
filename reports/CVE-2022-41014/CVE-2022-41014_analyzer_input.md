# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41014

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no static dhcp mac WORD (WORD|null) ip A.B.C.D hostname (WORD|null) description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-41014.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to format command parameters into a stack buffer without proper size checks. When the input parameters are larger than the buffer, it leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow (CWE-120). The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates with special keywords like `WORD`, `CODE`, `A.B.C.D`, `<min_value-max_value>`, and `(choice1|choice2....)`. These keywords fill the `argv` array. The `sprintf` function, used to format the command string, does not check if the size of the command parameters will exceed the buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device. This could lead to a complete compromise of the router, including unauthorized access to the network, data theft, denial of service, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially-crafted network packet containing a command for the `DetranCLI` interface. An attacker needs to send a sequence of requests to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. The CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs high privileges `(PR:H)` to exploit the vulnerability. However, the report doesn't specify the exact method for gaining such privileges.
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network `(AV:N)`.
