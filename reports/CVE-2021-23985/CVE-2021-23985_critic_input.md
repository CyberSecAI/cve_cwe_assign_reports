# Critic Input for CVE-2021-23985



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
If an attacker is able to alter specific aboutconfig values (for example malware running on the users computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could have been enabled in a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed a remote attacker (able to make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor the users browsing activity and (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed by providing a visual cue when Devtools has an open network socket. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **improper user notification**
- **impact:** monitor browsing activity and plaintext network traffic
- **vector:** altering specific aboutconfig values
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Firefox
- **version:** < 87
- **component:** Devtools remote debugging feature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23985

**Root Cause:**
The DevTools remote debugging feature could be enabled without any visual indication to the user when certain `about:config` values were modified, specifically `devtools.debugger.prompt-connection` set to `false` and `remote-enabled` set to `true`. This configuration would allow remote connections to the browser without user awareness.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of visual cue when DevTools remote debugging is enabled. This allowed malicious actors to remotely connect and monitor browsing activity without the user's knowledge.
- The configuration setting `devtools.debugger.prompt-connection` being set to `false`, which is primarily for automated testing, could also be exploited by malicious actors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Monitoring of browsing activity:** A remote attacker could monitor the user's browsing activity.
- **Plaintext network traffic capture:** A remote attacker could intercept and view plaintext network traffic.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** Information transmitted over the network could be exposed to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malware:** An attacker could use malware running on the user's computer to modify the `about:config` values.
- **Remote Connection:** Once the settings were altered, a remote attacker could connect to the browser over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to modify `about:config` values:** The attacker needs to be able to change Firefox settings on the user's machine, typically through malware.
- **Direct network connection:**  The attacker needs to be able to make a direct network connection to the victim's browser once the remote debugging is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a visual cue in the URL bar when DevTools has an open network socket, providing a clear indication to the user that remote debugging is enabled.
- The fix was implemented by reusing the same visual cue (robot head icon) used by Marionette/Puppeteer, which was already triggered by a `remote-listening` observer notification.
- The initial report came from ZDI (Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative) who stated that this had been abused in the wild by malware.
- The bug report mentions the possibility of locking preferences but was deferred to a follow-up. The fix implemented is primarily the visual cue to notify the user when remote debugging is enabled.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** lies in the **improper user notification** regarding the DevTools remote debugging feature. The vulnerability description states that an attacker could alter specific aboutconfig values to enable remote debugging in a way that was unnoticeable to the user. This aligns directly with CWE-451 [User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information], as the UI fails to properly represent the critical information (that remote debugging is enabled). The fix implemented involves providing a visual cue when DevTools has an open network socket, further emphasizing the **weakness** in UI representation. While CWE-451 is a Class, it effectively captures the essence of the problem, and a more specific variant isn't available. The MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-451 with review, acknowledging that a more specific base-level child might be ideal, but in this case, it's the most appropriate high-level classification.
  Additionally, once remote debugging is enabled the plaintext network traffic can be monitored, and that aligns with CWE-319 [Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information].

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-451 has no direct relationships listed, but it could be argued that it is related to other UI-related CWEs. CWE-319 has no direct relationships listed in the provided information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the clear description of **improper user notification** and the nature of the implemented fix)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

### Extended Description


If an attacker can cause the UI to display erroneous data, or to otherwise convince the user to display information that appears to come from a trusted source, then the attacker could trick the user into performing the wrong action. This is often a component in phishing attacks, but other kinds of problems exist. For example, if the UI is used to monitor the security state of a system or network, then omitting or obscuring an important indicator could prevent the user from detecting and reacting to a security-critical event.


UI misrepresentation can take many forms:


  - Incorrect indicator: incorrect information is displayed, which prevents the user from understanding the true state of the product or the environment the product is monitoring, especially of potentially-dangerous conditions or operations. This can be broken down into several different subtypes.

  - Overlay: an area of the display is intended to give critical information, but another process can modify the display by overlaying another element on top of it. The user is not interacting with the expected portion of the user interface. This is the problem that enables clickjacking attacks, although many other types of attacks exist that involve overlay.

  - Icon manipulation: the wrong icon, or the wrong color indicator, can be influenced (such as making a dangerous .EXE executable look like a harmless .GIF)

  - Timing: the product is performing a state transition or context switch that is presented to the user with an indicator, but a race condition can cause the wrong indicator to be used before the product has fully switched context. The race window could be extended indefinitely if the attacker can trigger an error.

  - Visual truncation: important information could be truncated from the display, such as a long filename with a dangerous extension that is not displayed in the GUI because the malicious portion is truncated. The use of excessive whitespace can also cause truncation, or place the potentially-dangerous indicator outside of the user's field of view (e.g. "filename.txt .exe"). A different type of truncation can occur when a portion of the information is removed due to reasons other than length, such as the accidental insertion of an end-of-input marker in the middle of an input, such as a NUL byte in a C-style string.

  - Visual distinction: visual information might be presented in a way that makes it difficult for the user to quickly and correctly distinguish between critical and unimportant segments of the display.

  - Homographs: letters from different character sets, fonts, or languages can appear very similar (i.e. may be visually equivalent) in a way that causes the human user to misread the text (for example, to conduct phishing attacks to trick a user into visiting a malicious web site with a visually-similar name as a trusted site). This can be regarded as a type of visual distinction issue.
