# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1220 | Insufficient Granularity of Access Control | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly point to **insufficient granularity of access control** as the root cause. An attacker with permission to expire verification codes could **expire codes from other realms** because the system did not properly validate if the user/API key had authorization to expire that *specific* code. This aligns directly with CWE-1220, "Insufficient Granularity of Access Control," which describes a scenario where access controls lack the necessary precision, allowing unauthorized access.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships mentioned for CWE-1220 in the provided information. However, the description of CWE-1220 aligns directly with the vulnerability, confirming its relevance.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24985](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24985): A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2021-36934** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36934](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36934): An operating system has an overly permission Access Control List onsome system files, including those related to user passwords
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-22565**: An attacker could prematurely expire a verification code, making it unusable by the patient, making the patient unable to upload their TEKs to generate exposure notifications. We recommend upgrading the Exposure Notification server to V1.1.2 or greater.
- **CVE-2022-21216**: Insufficient granularity of access control in out-of-band management in some Intel(R) Atom and Intel Xeon Scalable Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via adjacent network access.
- **CVE-2022-2475**: Haas Controller version 100.20.000.1110 has insufficient granularity of access control when using the "Ethernet Q Commands" service. Any user is able to write macros into registers outside of the authorized accessible range. This could allow a user to access privileged resources or resources out of context.
- **CVE-2022-36110**: Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. Prior to version 0.15.1, Improper Authorization functions lead to non-privileged users running privileged API calls. If someone adds users to the Netmaker platform who do not have admin privileges, they can use their auth tokens to run admin-level functions via the API. This problem has been patched in v0.15.1.
- **CVE-2022-1025**: All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level.
- **CVE-2022-24985**: Forms generated by JQueryForm.com before 2022-02-05 allows a remote authenticated attacker to bypass authentication and access the administrative section of other forms hosted on the same web server. This is relevant only when an organization hosts more than one of these forms on their server.
