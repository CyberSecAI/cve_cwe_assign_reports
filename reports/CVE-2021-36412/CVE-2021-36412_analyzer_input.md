## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2021-36412.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `gp_rtp_builder_do_mpeg12_video` function within the `ietf/rtp_pck_mpeg12.c` file of the GPAC multimedia framework.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow. The code attempts to access `payload[4]` without proper bounds checking, leading to a read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted media file using the `MP4Box` tool. The specific input is related to MPEG12 video.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted media file that, when processed by `MP4Box`, triggers the heap-buffer-overflow in `gp_rtp_builder_do_mpeg12_video`. The attacker doesn't need to have local access to the system since it can be triggered through processing of a file.

The provided information gives additional context, including source code snippets and the specific function and line number where the overflow occurs, along with the patch commit.
