# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-2037

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CWE-639  | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key| 0.75 | Base  | Primary | Allowed. The vulnerability stems from improper authorization, allowing a user to gain access to another user's data by manipulating the key value identifying the data.
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.50 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged. While the root cause is an authorization issue, the description is too general and a more specific CWE is preferred.
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.50 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review. Similar to CWE-285, the root cause is an authorization issue, but this class is too general and a more specific CWE is preferred.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description highlights an **excessive attack surface** related to user invitations and organization context. The **root cause** is an **insecure handling of organization tokens and invitation tokens**, where the application didn't properly enforce the organization context during password setting. The code changes aim to fix this by explicitly enforcing organization context, suggesting a previous vulnerability where users could potentially gain unauthorized access to organizations. This aligns well with CWE-639 which addresses authorization bypass through user-controlled keys. The attacker can gain unauthorized access to other users' data/records by modifying the key value identifying the data (in this case, organization tokens and invitation tokens).

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-639 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for mapping to the root cause of the vulnerability. It doesn't have direct relationships in the provided data, but its essence relates to authorization and access control issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials focusing on authorization).

## Known Examples for CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36539): An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26679**: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as "profile pictures." The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.
- **CVE-2021-41847**: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.
- **CVE-2021-22906**: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.
- **CVE-2021-21012**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **CVE-2021-21013**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the customer API module. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure and update arbitrary information on another user's account.
- **CVE-2021-21022**: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the product module. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to restricted resources.
- **CVE-2021-21255**: GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI version 9.5.3, it was possible to switch entities with IDOR from a logged in user. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- **CVE-2021-24318**: The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.
- **CVE-2021-26024**: The Favorites component before 1.0.2 for Nagios XI 5.8.0 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference: it is possible to create favorites for any other user account.
