# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-43316

## Vulnerability Description
A **heap-based buffer overflow** was discovered in upx, during the generic pointer p points to an inaccessible address in func get_le64().

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** upx

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content is related to CVE-2021-43316.

**Root Cause:**
A heap-based buffer overflow occurs within the `get_le64()` function when a generic pointer 'p' points to an inaccessible memory address. This issue arises specifically in the `PackLinuxElf64::elf_lookup()` function when processing a crafted or suspicious file, causing the program to try to access memory out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Improper bounds checking when accessing memory using `get_te64()` in `PackLinuxElf64::elf_lookup()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a crafted/suspicious file to be processed by UPX.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted input file that triggers the vulnerability
- Ability to run the vulnerable UPX application with the malicious input file.
