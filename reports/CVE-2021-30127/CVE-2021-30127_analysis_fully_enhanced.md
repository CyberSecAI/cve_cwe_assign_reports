| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-1188 | Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that TerraMaster F2-210 devices use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet, which is inconsistent with the documentation. This indicates an **insecure default** configuration where the device automatically opens ports via UPnP, exposing services to the internet without explicit user consent. This aligns with CWE-1188 (Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the NAS is incorrectly punching ports via UPnP and doesn't respect settings to disable UPnP. The insecure default leads to **unintended exposure** of the web interface."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-1188 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for describing the root cause. While other CWEs like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) or CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) might seem relevant, they are more abstract and less specific to the underlying issue of an insecure default configuration. CWE-1188 can precede CWE-668 since the initial insecure default can lead to exposing resources to the wrong control sphere."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, but lacking deeper technical details)



## Known Examples for CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-16247**: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.
- **CVE-2020-15824**: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.
- **CVE-2021-22118**: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.
- **CVE-2021-21334**: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.
- **CVE-2021-22047**: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.
- **CVE-2021-22550**: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c
- **CVE-2021-38712**: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents. NOTE: the vendor's recommended solution is to block the access via an NGINX configuration file.
- **CVE-2021-40496**: SAP Internet Communication framework (ICM) - versions 700, 701, 702, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 785, allows an attacker with logon functionality, to exploit the authentication function by using POST and form field to repeat executions of the initial command by a GET request and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.
- **CVE-2021-40497**: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.
- **CVE-2021-22044**: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.
