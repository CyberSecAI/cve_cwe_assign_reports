| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-908 | Use of Uninitialized Resource | 0.95      | Base                  | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the **use of uninitialized memory** as the root cause. Specifically, a DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer and used as an index, ultimately leading to memory corruption. This aligns directly with CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), which describes a product using or accessing a resource that has not been initialized. The CVE reference summary further reinforces this, stating that the root cause involves data from an uninitialized memory buffer. The MITRE mapping guidance designates CWE-908 as ALLOWED, and it is at the preferred Base level of abstraction.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other CWEs like CWE-456 (Missing Initialization of a Variable) and CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable) are related, CWE-908 is a more direct and encompassing description of the weakness. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a strong secondary candidate because the uninitialized value is used as an index which results in memory corruption, indicating a write outside the intended boundaries. The use of the uninitialized value as an index and subsequent increment to a stack variable is the mechanism by which the out-of-bounds write is achieved.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference, combined with MITRE mapping guidance.)

## Known Examples for CWE-456: Missing Initialization of a Variable
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-6078** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6078](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6078): Chain: The return value of a function returning a pointer is not checked for success (CWE-252) resulting in the later use of an uninitialized variable (CWE-456) and a null pointer dereference (CWE-476)
- **CVE-2009-2692** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2692](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2692): Chain: Use of an unimplemented network socket operation pointing to an uninitialized handler function (CWE-456) causes a crash because of a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **CVE-2020-20739** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-20739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-20739): A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage
- **CVE-2005-2978** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2978](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2978): Product uses uninitialized variables for size and index, leading to resultant buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2005-2109** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2109](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2109): Internal variable in PHP application is not initialized, allowing external modification.
- **CVE-2005-2193** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2193](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2193): Array variable not initialized in PHP application, leading to resultant SQL injection.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1405**: A vulnerability in the email parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software version 0.103.1 and all prior versions could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper variable initialization that may result in an NULL pointer read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-22482**: There is an Uninitialized variable vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause transmission of invalid data.
- **CVE-2022-22704**: The zabbix-agent2 package before 5.4.9-r1 for Alpine Linux sometimes allows privilege escalation to root because the design incorrectly expected that systemd would (in effect) determine part of the configuration.


## Known Examples for CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-15900** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15900](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15900): Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
