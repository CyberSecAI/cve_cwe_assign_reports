# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-2949

## Query
Altair HyperView Player versions 2021.1.0.27 and prior are vulnerable to the use of uninitialized memory vulnerability during parsing of H3D files. A DWORD is extracted from an uninitialized buffer and, after sign extension, is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter leading to memory corruption.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: use of uninitialized memory
