# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-0891

## Vulnerability Description
A **heap buffer overflow** in ExtractImageSection function in tiffcrop.c in libtiff library Version 4.3.0 allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **impact:** application crash and information disclosure
- **vector:** crafted TIFF image file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** libtiff library
- **version:** Version 4.3.0
- **component:** ExtractImageSection function in tiffcrop.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0891:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Heap buffer overflow in the `extractImageSection` function within `/tools/tiffcrop.c`. A separate report identifies a heap use-after-free vulnerability at the same location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap buffer overflow**: Writing beyond the allocated memory boundary on the heap within the `extractImageSection` function.
- **Heap use-after-free:** Accessing memory that has already been freed in the `extractImageSection` function after a previous `free` call in the `rotateImage` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow and use-after-free conditions lead to crashes and can cause a denial of service by terminating the application.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, heap overflows can be leveraged for code execution by overwriting critical data, potentially allowing for more severe impacts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted TIFF file using the `tiffcrop` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to be processed by the vulnerable `tiffcrop` tool.  This is a user-assisted vulnerability.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `extractImageSection` function at line 6866 of `/tools/tiffcrop.c`.
- The exploit involves processing a crafted TIFF file with specific parameters such as `-i -E l -H 10 -V 10 -S 8:4 -R 270` using the `tiffcrop` tool.
- The heap use-after-free occurs because memory allocated in `rotateImage` is later freed, but a reference to that memory is later used in `extractImageSection`.
- The vulnerability is present in `libtiff` versions prior to 4.4.0.
- The AddressSanitizer logs clearly identify heap-buffer-overflow and heap-use-after-free at the specified location.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Gentoo advisory mentions multiple vulnerabilities in LibTIFF, including CVE-2022-0891, and recommends upgrading to version 4.4.0 or later.
- The NetApp advisory lists CVE-2022-0891 as a high severity vulnerability that can lead to information disclosure or DoS.
- Fedora also issued updates to address this vulnerability.
- Patches were made to fix this issue in `libtiff` (commit `232282fd`).
-  The `poc.zip` file provided in the Gitlab report appears to contain a proof of concept TIFF file that triggers the vulnerability.
