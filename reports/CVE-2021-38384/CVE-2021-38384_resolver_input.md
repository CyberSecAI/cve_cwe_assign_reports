# Resolution Input for CVE-2021-38384

## Vulnerability Description
Serverless Offline 8.0.0 returns a 403 HTTP status code for a route that has a trailing / character, which might cause a developer to implement incorrect access control, because the actual behavior within the Amazon AWS environment is a 200 HTTP status code (i.e., possibly greater than expected permissions).

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-393 | Return of Wrong Status Code | 0.85 | Base | Primary | The primary weakness is the incorrect return of a 403 status code when a 200 is expected. |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.60 | Class | Secondary | This CWE is related to the incorrect authorization due to the different status code. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.40 | Class | Secondary | This CWE is related to potentially exposing resources due to incorrect authorization |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in Serverless Offline returning an unexpected HTTP 403 status code for a route that should return 200, potentially leading developers to implement **incorrect access control**. The **root cause** is the serverless-offline plugin incorrectly handling routes with trailing slashes. This aligns with CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) because the plugin returns an incorrect status code which then causes developers to modify access controls. The CVE reference includes CWE-863, and while this is more general, it is related to the overall vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) is a Base level CWE and doesn't have explicit parent-child relationships to access control CWEs, it directly impacts the application's behavior. CWE-863 is a class-level weakness related to authorization that the CVE lists in the additional details.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct alignment with status code issue and supporting CVE information)

## Criticism
Okay, here's a review of the provided CWE analysis, incorporating the full CWE specifications:

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis correctly identifies CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) as the primary weakness. The justification is strong, and the confidence level is appropriate.  The use of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a secondary CWE is also justifiable, given that the incorrect status code leads to developers potentially implementing incorrect authorization logic.  The inclusion of CWE-668 is weaker, and could likely be removed.

**Detailed Review:**

*   **CWE-393: Return of Wrong Status Code (Primary)**

    *   **Assessment:** This is the most accurate and direct mapping for the reported vulnerability. The vulnerability centers around the misrepresentation of the actual system behavior through an incorrect HTTP status code.  The extended description of CWE-393 aligns perfectly: "A function or operation returns an incorrect return value or status code that does not indicate an error, but causes the product to modify its behavior based on the incorrect result. This can lead to unpredictable behavior. If the function is used to make security-critical decisions or provide security-critical information, then the wrong status code can cause the product to assume that an action is safe, even when it is not."
    *   **Confidence:**  The confidence score of 0.85 is justified.
    *   **Mapping Guidance Compliance:** The analysis correctly acknowledges that CWE-393 is a Base-level CWE, making it a preferred level of abstraction.
    *   **CWE Examples:** The examples provided in the CWE specifications, especially CVE-2003-1132, CVE-2001-1509, and the Top 25 example CVE-2021-38384, reinforce the appropriateness of this mapping.
    *   **Potential Mitigations:** While the CWE specifications don't offer mitigations *within* the CWE description (being a Base-level CWE), the analysis appropriately focuses on the impact of the incorrect status code *leading to* incorrect access control implementations.  The Serverless Offline team needs to fix the behavior of returning a 403 instead of a 200. Developers using the tool need to be aware of this discrepancy.
    *   **Suggested Improvement:** None.

*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization (Secondary)**

    *   **Assessment:**  The inclusion of CWE-863 is related, but a bit more abstract. The analysis correctly points out the vulnerability *can* lead to incorrect authorization implementations by developers relying on the incorrect status code.  The mapping guidance for CWE-863 states "Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit", so we should consider possible alternative CWEs.
    *   **Confidence:** The confidence score of 0.60 is reasonable.
    *   **Mapping Guidance Compliance:**  The analysis acknowledges that CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE and that a more specific child CWE might be preferable.
    *   **CWE Examples:**  The provided examples in the CWE specifications are somewhat less directly related than those for CWE-393.
    *   **Potential Mitigations:** Mitigations for CWE-863 include RBAC, business logic checks and using vetted libraries. These are related, but not as direct.
    *   **Suggested Improvement:** CWE-647 is a better fit than 863:
        * **CWE-647:** *Use of Non-Canonical URL Paths for Authorization Decisions* The description of this CWE notes "... if the application only wants to allow access to http://www.example.com/mypage, then the attacker might be able to bypass this restriction using equivalent URLs such as: ... http://www.example.com/mypage/ (trailing /)". This matches the vector. In addition, CWE-647 is a child of CWE-863 which maintains the original CVE's listing, and follows mapping guidance to be at the preferred variant level.

*   **CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (Secondary)**

    *   **Assessment:**  This is the weakest mapping and is essentially a restatement of the impact. The core problem isn't directly about *exposing* a resource, but about misrepresenting access control. While incorrect authorization *could* lead to exposure, it's not the primary mechanism.
    *   **Confidence:** A confidence score of 0.40 is appropriate, but I would lower it.
    *   **Mapping Guidance Compliance:** The mapping guidance for CWE-668 strongly discourages its use, stating, "CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable...Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake." This analysis has better fits with CWE-393 and CWE-863.
    *   **CWE Examples:** The examples provided in the CWE specification are not relevant.
    *   **Potential Mitigations:** While mitigations for CWE-668 include cloud storage controls, they are not as relevant to the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Suggested Improvement:** Remove this CWE entirely. It is too broad and doesn't accurately reflect the root cause.

**Retriever Results:**

*   The inclusion of CWE-393 as top combined result validates the selection of this as the primary CWE.
*   CWE-647 showing up as the #3 result validates the selection of it being a replacement to CWE-863.
*   The other results can be safely ignored.

**Revised Summary Table:**

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-393 | Return of Wrong Status Code | 0.85 | Base | Primary | The primary weakness is the incorrect return of a 403 status code when a 200 is expected. |
| CWE-647 | Use of Non-Canonical URL Paths for Authorization Decisions | 0.60 | Variant | Secondary | The incorrect return code can cause misconfiguration of security, and is related to non-canonical URL paths because it relates to trailing /. |
