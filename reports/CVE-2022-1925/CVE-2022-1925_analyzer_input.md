# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1925

## Vulnerability Description
DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using HEADERSTRIP decompression. Integer overflow in matroskaparse element in gst_matroska_decompress_data function which causes a **heap overflow**. Due to restrictions on chunk sizes in the matroskademux element, the overflow cant be triggered, however the matroskaparse element has no size checks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **vector:** mkv demuxing using HEADERSTRIP decompression
- **product:** gstreamer
- **component:** matroskaparse element

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-1925:

**Root Cause:**

*   Integer overflow in the `gst_matroska_decompress_data` function within the GStreamer Matroska demuxer. This occurs during the decompression of zlib-encoded data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The size of the decompressed data, which can be larger than 2^32,  is stored in a 32-bit integer (`new_size`). This results in an integer overflow when a large, zlib-compressed block with a decompressed size exceeding 2^32 bytes is encountered.
*   **Size Mismatch:** The `zstream` data counters use 64-bit integers while 32-bit integers are used to store the size in `gst_matroska_decompress_data`. This difference allows for a larger size to be tracked during decompression than can be accommodated by the storage used.
*   **Heap Overflow Potential:** When a `realloc` operation is performed with the overflowed `new_size` it can result in writing to unmapped memory or a heap overflow depending on the underlying libc and OS capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash (segfault) of the application processing the malformed Matroska file.
*  **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the libc implementation doesn't use `mmap` or if the underlying OS doesn't support `mmap`, the vulnerability could result in a heap overwrite leading to potential arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Media File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted Matroska (.mkv) file containing a zlib-compressed block designed to trigger the integer overflow when decompressed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a malformed media file:** The attacker needs to provide a manipulated MKV file to a vulnerable application using the GStreamer library.
*   **No special privileges are needed.**

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects GStreamer versions including 1.16.2
*   The issue is located within the `gst/matroska/matroska-read-common.c` file in the `gst-plugins-good` subproject.
