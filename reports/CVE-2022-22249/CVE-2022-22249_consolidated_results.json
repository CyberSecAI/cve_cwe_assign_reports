  "query": "An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When there is a continuous mac move a memory corruption causes one or more FPCs to crash and reboot. These MAC moves can be between two local interfaces or between core/EVPN and local interface.
