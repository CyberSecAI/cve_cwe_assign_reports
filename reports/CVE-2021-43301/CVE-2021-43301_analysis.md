| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack overflow**" occurs in the `pjsua_playlist_create` API due to an attacker-controlled `file_names` argument being copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without size validation. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant-level CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating the **root cause** is a stack overflow due to insufficient size validation, and the **weakness** is the missing size checks. CWE-121 is therefore selected as the primary CWE. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is selected as a secondary weakness because the root cause includes missing validation of the filenames size.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 is related to CWE-121 because the buffer overflow is caused by the lack of validation of the input size.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary.)
