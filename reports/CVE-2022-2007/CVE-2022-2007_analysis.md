The **heap corruption** also supports this as UAF often leads to memory corruption. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section confirms the **root cause** as a **use-after-free** vulnerability in WebGPU. The retriever results also confirm that CWE-416 is the top candidate with a high score. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.
