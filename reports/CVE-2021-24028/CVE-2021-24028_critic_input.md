# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An **invalid free** in Thrifts table-based serialization can cause the application to crash or potentially result in code execution or other undesirable effects. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2021.02.22.00.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **invalid free**
- **impact:** ['crash application', 'code execution']
- **product:** Facebook Thrift
- **version:** prior to v2021.02.22.00
- **component:** Thrifts table-based serialization

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-24028

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of duplicate union data within the table-based serializer in Facebook's Thrift library. Specifically, when the input data contained multiple entries for the same union, the previous active member was overwritten without properly calling its destructor, which could lead to a memory leak and potentially other issues. Additionally, incomplete data during the deserialization process could lead to incorrect destructors being called during stack unwinding, resulting in a segfault, data corruption, or other undesirable effects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper destructor handling: Overwriting union members without invoking destructors for the previous active members leads to memory leaks.
- Incorrect destructor call during stack unwinding: Incomplete data during deserialization results in incorrect destructor calls during stack unwinding, leading to potential crashes or data corruption.
- Incorrect type for active field ID: The code used `FieldID` instead of `int` for storing the active field ID of a union.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory leaks: If an attacker sends specially crafted messages with duplicate union data, the server could experience memory leaks which could lead to denial of service or other impacts
- Segfault/Crash: Incomplete or malformed messages during deserialization process could lead to incorrect destructor calls, causing the application to crash.
- Data corruption: Incorrect destructor calls or improper handling of union data could lead to data corruption within the application's memory space.
- Undesirable effects: This is a broad category that could potentially include other issues caused by memory corruption, and in theory under certain circumstances, code execution cannot be completely ruled out

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by providing specially crafted or malformed serialized data to the Thrift table-based serializer. The malformed input should include:
- Duplicate union data: Including multiple entries for the same union in a message.
- Incomplete data: Providing a partially specified union field with a missing value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to a service/application using the vulnerable version of Facebook's Thrift library.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit fixes the issue by clearing the union if an active member already exists and changing the type of the active field id.
- The vulnerability affects Facebook Thrift versions prior to v2021.02.22.00.
- The vulnerability was identified and fixed internally by Facebook.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an "**invalid free**" in Thrifts table-based serialization. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary details that the vulnerability stems from improper handling of duplicate union data, leading to memory leaks and potential incorrect destructor calls. This can manifest as a **double free** if the same memory is released twice, which is precisely what CWE-415 (Double Free) describes: "The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations." The description aligns directly with the documented **rootcause** and impact.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-415 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It is related to memory management issues and can lead to crashes and data corruption, which are consistent with the vulnerability's described impacts.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "**invalid free**" and detailed explanation in the CVE reference links)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

### Alternative Terms
Double-free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that each allocation is freed only once. After freeing a chunk, set the pointer to NULL to ensure the pointer cannot be freed again. In complicated error conditions, be sure that clean-up routines respect the state of allocation properly. If the language is object oriented, ensure that object destructors delete each chunk of memory only once.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Use a static analysis tool to find double free instances.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.
