# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-415 | Double Free | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an "**invalid free**" in Thrifts table-based serialization. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary details that the vulnerability stems from improper handling of duplicate union data, leading to memory leaks and potential incorrect destructor calls. This can manifest as a **double free** if the same memory is released twice, which is precisely what CWE-415 (Double Free) describes: "The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations." The description aligns directly with the documented **rootcause** and impact.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-415 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It is related to memory management issues and can lead to crashes and data corruption, which are consistent with the vulnerability's described impacts.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "**invalid free**" and detailed explanation in the CVE reference links)
