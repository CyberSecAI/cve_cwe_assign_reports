### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476), Attempt to Access Child of a Non-structure Pointer (CWE-588)**
- **product:** Zephyr
- **version:** >= v2.4.0
- **component:** 802154 Frame Validation

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper processing of omitted source and destination addresses in IEEE 802.15.4 frame validation, specifically within the `ieee802154_validate_frame` function. When source/destination addresses are omitted or the packet is too short, NULL pointers are incorrectly handled, leading to a corrupted pointer being used in later processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  Improper handling of NULL pointers during address validation in `ieee802154_validate_frame`.
    -  Lack of NULL pointer checks in `set_pkt_ll_addr`, leading to assignment of invalid pointer values.
    -  Use of corrupted pointer in `sys_mem_swap` within `ieee802154_manage_recv_packet`, causing unintended memory manipulation.
    - In MAC Command frames, usage of potentially NULL destination address during validation leads to a crash
-  **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Denial of service (crash of firmware) due to invalid memory access.
    -  In some niche cases, potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the memory corruption can be manipulated to overwrite critical system data like the initial stack pointer and reset vector address.
-  **Attack vectors**:
    -  Sending specially crafted IEEE 802.15.4 frames with omitted or invalid source/destination addresses.
    -  Sending too short packets that trigger the vulnerability.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  Attacker needs to be able to send IEEE 802.15.4 frames to the vulnerable device.
    - No specific user interaction is required.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms the root cause involves improper handling of NULL pointers during IEEE 802.15.4 frame validation, specifically within the `ieee802154_validate_frame` function. The lack of NULL pointer checks in `set_pkt_ll_addr` further supports this. This aligns directly with CWE-476, which describes a product dereferencing a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL. The impact is a denial of service (crash). MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-476 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-476 is a Base level CWE. While it's a child of CWE-754 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions), CWE-476 is more specific. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-476 as the primary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention in the vulnerability description and reinforced by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description includes "**Attempt to Access Child of a Non-structure Pointer (CWE-588)**". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions that when source/destination addresses are omitted, NULL pointers are incorrectly handled, leading to a corrupted pointer being used. This corrupted pointer is then used to access memory, which aligns with the description of CWE-588.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-588 is a Variant level CWE, providing more specificity than its parent.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (Explicit mention in the vulnerability description and supports the root cause.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-38599**: WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of the official binary releases published as GitHub Releases) is used, silently ignores the libsodium encryption key and uploads cleartext backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation because "the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity."
- **CVE-2021-39196**: pcapture is an open source dumpcap web service interface . In affected versions this vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged user to use the REST API to capture and download packets with no capture filter and without adequate permissions. This is important because the capture filters can effectively limit the scope of information that a user can see in the data captures. If no filter is present, then all data on the local network segment where the program is running can be captured and downloaded. v3.12 fixes this problem. There is no workaround, you must upgrade to v3.12 or greater.
- **CVE-2020-15117**: In Synergy before version 1.12.0, a Synergy server can be crashed by receiving a kMsgHelloBack packet with a client name length set to 0xffffffff (4294967295) if the servers memory is less than 4 GB. It was verified that this issue does not cause a crash through the exception handler if the available memory of the Server is more than 4GB.
- **CVE-2020-15223**: In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors coming from the storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for her advantage depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed in version 0.34.0
- **CVE-2020-15566**: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a host OS crash because of incorrect error handling in event-channel port allocation. The allocation of an event-channel port may fail for multiple reasons: (1) port is already in use, (2) the memory allocation failed, or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than what is supported by the ABI (e.g., 2L or FIFO) used by the guest or the limit set by an administrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due to the missing error checks, only (1) will be considered an error. All the other cases will provide a valid port and will result in a crash when trying to access the event channel. When the administrator configured a guest to allow more than 1023 event channels, that guest may be able to crash the host. When Xen is out-of-memory, allocation of new event channels will result in crashing the host rather than reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are affected. All architectures are affected. The default configuration, when guests are created with xl/libxl, is not vulnerable, because of the default event-channel limit.
- **CVE-2021-31361**: An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability combined with Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated network based attacker to cause increased FPC CPU utilization by sending specific IP packets which are being VXLAN encapsulated leading to a partial Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipted of these specific traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX Series: All versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S4; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S12; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S7; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S4; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S1; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S3, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

### Extended Description


The programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions, thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability, incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability.


Note that this entry is not exclusively about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

CanPrecede -> CWE-416
ParentOf -> CWE-252
ParentOf -> CWE-253
ParentOf -> CWE-273
ParentOf -> CWE-354
ParentOf -> CWE-394
ParentOf -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Choose languages with features such as exception handling that force the programmer to anticipate unusual conditions that may generate exceptions. Custom exceptions may need to be developed to handle unusual business-logic conditions. Be careful not to pass sensitive exceptions back to the user (CWE-209, CWE-248).


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is expected.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** If using exception handling, catch and throw specific exceptions instead of overly-general exceptions (CWE-396, CWE-397). Catch and handle exceptions as locally as possible so that exceptions do not propagate too far up the call stack (CWE-705). Avoid unchecked or uncaught exceptions where feasible (CWE-248).



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2007-3798:** Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.
- **CVE-2006-4447:** Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.



## CWE-588: Attempt to Access Child of a Non-structure Pointer
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Casting a non-structure type to a structure type and accessing a field can lead to memory access errors or data corruption.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-704
ChildOf -> CWE-758

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** The choice could be made to use a language that is not susceptible to these issues.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Review of type casting operations can identify locations where incompatible types are cast.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3510:** JSON decoder accesses a C union using an invalid offset to an object



## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If all pointers that could have been modified are checked for NULL before use, nearly all NULL pointer dereferences can be prevented.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Select a programming language that is not susceptible to these issues.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is non-null before acting upon it.




### Observed Examples
