## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that an unauthenticated attacker can **redirect users to a malicious site**. This aligns well with CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')). CWE-601 describes a scenario where a web application accepts user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and uses that link in a redirect. The fact that the attacker is unauthenticated strengthens the case for CWE-601, as there is no access control preventing the redirection. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-601 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED. CWE-1022 (Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access) is also a possibility, but it involves the `window.opener` object, which is not explicitly mentioned in the description. Thus, CWE-601 is the primary weakness.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships for CWE-601 provided in the context. CWE-601 is a Base level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High match with the vulnerability description and the CWE definition. The description focuses on the redirection aspect which is core to CWE-601.

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1022 (Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with `window.opener` Access) is a secondary candidate. While the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention the `window.opener` object, the Reverse Tabnabbing vulnerability type can involve it. Reverse Tabnabbing exploits the `window.opener` relationship between pages, allowing a malicious page to modify the original page's location. Given that this is a possibility, CWE-1022 is considered. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1022 indicates its usage is ALLOWED and is at the Variant level of abstraction.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships for CWE-1022 provided in the context. CWE-1022 is a Variant level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Possible, but less direct evidence compared to CWE-601. The reliance on reverse tabnabbing requiring the `window.opener` makes it less confident.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1022: Use of Web Link to Untrusted Target with window.opener Access
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application produces links to untrusted external sites outside of its sphere of control, but it does not properly prevent the external site from modifying  security-critical properties of the window.opener object, such as the location property.

### Extended Description
When a user clicks a link to an external site ("target"), the target="_blank" attribute causes the target site's contents to be opened in a new window or tab, which runs in the same process as the original page. The window.opener object records information about the original page that offered the link. If an attacker can run script on the target page, then they could read or modify certain properties of the window.opener object, including the location property - even if the original and target site are not the same origin. An attacker can modify the location property to automatically redirect the user to a malicious site, e.g. as part of a phishing attack. Since this redirect happens in the original window/tab - which is not necessarily visible, since the browser is focusing the display on the new target page - the user might not notice any suspicious redirection.

### Alternative Terms
tabnabbing

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-266

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Specify in the design that any linked external document must not be granted access to the location object of the calling page.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

When creating a link to an external document using the <a> tag with a defined target, for example "_blank" or a named frame, provide the rel attribute with a value "noopener noreferrer".


If opening the external document in a new window via javascript, then reset the opener by setting it equal to null.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Do not use "_blank" targets. However, this can affect the usability of the application.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-4927:** Library software does not use rel: "noopener noreferrer" setting, allowing tabnabbing attacks to redirect to a malicious page



## CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a redirect.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Open Redirect
Cross-site Redirect
Cross-domain Redirect
Unvalidated Redirect

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-610
ChildOf -> CWE-610

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


Use a list of approved URLs or domains to be used for redirection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an intermediate disclaimer page that provides the user with a clear warning that they are leaving the current site. Implement a long timeout before the redirect occurs, or force the user to click on the link. Be careful to avoid XSS problems (CWE-79) when generating the disclaimer page.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Enforcement by Conversion
- **Description:** 

When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.


For example, ID 1 could map to "/login.asp" and ID 2 could map to "http://www.example.com/". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-45] provide this capability.




### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Whether this issue poses a vulnerability will be subject to the intended behavior of the application. For example, a search engine might intentionally provide redirects to arbitrary URLs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-4206:** URL parameter loads the URL into a frame and causes it to appear to be part of a valid page.
- **CVE-2008-2951:** An open redirect vulnerability in the search script in the software allows remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL as a parameter to the proper function.
- **CVE-2008-2052:** Open redirect vulnerability in the software allows remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the proper parameter.
