# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-40993

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the firmwall keyword WORD description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates with special keywords for parsing commands. The size of command parameters isn't checked against the stack buffer size before using `sprintf`, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in command parsing within the `DetranCLI` binary."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted network packet containing a vulnerable `DetranCLI` command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device, likely requiring network access and knowledge of the device's command structure. A high privilege user on the device is required to execute the vulnerable commands."
