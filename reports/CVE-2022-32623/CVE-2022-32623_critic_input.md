## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**out of bounds write** due to **incorrect error handling**". CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses the **weakness** of writing data beyond the intended buffer. CWE-703 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) is related to the **root cause** of the vulnerability which is **incorrect error handling**. The `mdp` component's failure to adequately handle errors leads to the out-of-bounds write condition. While CWE-703 is listed as a potential weakness, it's a high-level Pillar and less specific than CWE-787, which describes the direct coding error. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports the root cause and weakness, which is **incorrect error handling** leads to the out-of-bounds write.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a Base level CWE that accurately describes the **weakness**. CWE-703 is a high-level Pillar and is less specific.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "out of bounds write" and supporting CVE references.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-20637**: Improper check or handling of exceptional conditions in LOGITEC LAN-W300N/PR5B allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending a specially crafted URL.
- **CVE-2021-20642**: Improper check or handling of exceptional conditions in LOGITEC LAN-W300N/RS allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending a specially crafted URL.
- **CVE-2021-41580**: The passport-oauth2 package before 1.6.1 for Node.js mishandles the error condition of failure to obtain an access token. This is exploitable in certain use cases where an OAuth identity provider uses an HTTP 200 status code for authentication-failure error reports, and an application grants authorization upon simply receiving the access token (i.e., does not try to use the token). NOTE: the passport-oauth2 vendor does not consider this a passport-oauth2 vulnerability
- **CVE-2021-38608**: Incorrect Access Control in Tranquil WAPT Enterprise - before 1.8.2.7373 and before 2.0.0.9450 allows guest OS users to escalate privileges via WAPT Agent.
- **CVE-2021-35465**: Certain Arm products before 2021-08-23 do not properly consider the effect of exceptions on a VLLDM instruction. A Non-secure handler may have read or write access to part of a Secure context. This affects Arm Cortex-M33 r0p0 through r1p0, Arm Cortex-M35P r0, Arm Cortex-M55 r0p0 through r1p0, and Arm China STAR-MC1 (in the STAR SE configuration).
- **CVE-2020-1639**: When an attacker sends a specific crafted Ethernet Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (Ethernet OAM) packet to a target device, it may improperly handle the incoming malformed data and fail to sanitize this incoming data resulting in an overflow condition. This overflow condition in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by coring the CFM daemon. Continued receipt of these packets may cause an extended Denial of Service condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S15; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D95 on SRX Series; 14.1X50 versions prior to 14.1X50-D145; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D47; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R2; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D170 on SRX Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D67.
- **CVE-2020-5622**: Shadankun Server Security Type (excluding normal blocking method types) Ver.1.5.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service which may result in not being able to add newly detected attack source IP addresses as blocking targets for about 10 minutes via a specially crafted request.
- **CVE-2021-25365**: An improper exception control in softsimd prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged applications to access the API in softsimd.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

ParentOf -> CWE-228
ParentOf -> CWE-248
ParentOf -> CWE-392
ParentOf -> CWE-393
ParentOf -> CWE-397
ParentOf -> CWE-754

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a high-level class that might have some overlap with other classes. It could be argued that even "normal" weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2022-22224:** Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Memory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
