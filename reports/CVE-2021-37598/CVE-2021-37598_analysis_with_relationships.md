# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states a "bypass of /wp-json access control via a trailing ? character". This indicates that the intended access control mechanisms are circumvented by manipulating the request. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) describes a scenario where an application does not adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs, scripts, or files. Adding a trailing `?` character could be a method of directly requesting a resource that should otherwise be protected, thus bypassing access control. The `?` likely interferes with the intended URL parsing or authorization logic.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found in the provided information for CWE-425. However, it could be related to other authorization issues if the underlying problem is a general lack of proper authorization checks.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (The description directly aligns with bypassing access control using a specific technique.)
