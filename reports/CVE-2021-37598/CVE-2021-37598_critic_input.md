## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states a "bypass of /wp-json access control via a trailing ? character". This indicates that the intended access control mechanisms are circumvented by manipulating the request. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) describes a scenario where an application does not adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs, scripts, or files. Adding a trailing `?` character could be a method of directly requesting a resource that should otherwise be protected, thus bypassing access control. The `?` likely interferes with the intended URL parsing or authorization logic.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found in the provided information for CWE-425. However, it could be related to other authorization issues if the underlying problem is a general lack of proper authorization checks.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (The description directly aligns with bypassing access control using a specific technique.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

### Extended Description
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.

### Alternative Terms
forced browsing: The "forced browsing" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-862
ChildOf -> CWE-288
ChildOf -> CWE-424
CanPrecede -> CWE-471
CanPrecede -> CWE-98

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** Apply appropriate access control authorizations for each access to all restricted URLs, scripts or files.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider using MVC based frameworks such as Struts.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.

**[Theoretical]** "Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect.
- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.
