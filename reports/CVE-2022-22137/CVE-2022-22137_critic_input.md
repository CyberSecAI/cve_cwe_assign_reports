## Vulnerability Description
**A memory corruption vulnerability** exists in the ioca_mys_rgb_allocate functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.10. A specially-crafted malformed file can lead to an arbitrary free. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **A memory corruption vulnerability**
- **impact:** arbitrary free
- **vector:** specially-crafted malformed file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Accusoft ImageGear
- **version:** 19.1
- **component:** ioca_mys_rgb_allocate functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of buffer size when processing a malformed IOCA file. Specifically, when the `size_Y` value in the file is null, a zero-byte allocation occurs for the `table_mys_rgb` array and later when `IGDIBRunEnds::delete_table_mys_rbg_ptr` is called, the code attempts to free an uninitialized pointer within this array leading to an arbitrary free.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect buffer size calculation, leading to a zero-byte allocation and use of uninitialized memory in subsequent free operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can trigger an arbitrary free which can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted IOCA file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are required.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**a memory corruption vulnerability** exists... A specially-crafted malformed file can lead to an arbitrary free". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the root cause is an incorrect buffer size calculation, resulting in a zero-byte allocation. Subsequently, the code attempts to free an uninitialized pointer within this array, leading to an arbitrary free. This perfectly aligns with CWE-416 (Use After Free), as memory is allocated (albeit a zero-byte allocation), then freed, and the vulnerability occurs when attempting to access the freed memory, which is then followed by a free on that same memory again. The arbitrary free is the direct impact of the **memory corruption vulnerability**, making CWE-416 the most accurate primary mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant. It can be preceded by other CWEs that lead to memory being freed prematurely or incorrectly. It is also related to resource management issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the clear description of the use-after-free condition and supporting details in the CVE reference summary).

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer) is a plausible secondary candidate. The description mentions the code attempts to free an uninitialized pointer within the `table_mys_rgb` array. If the pointer is not initialized before being freed, it would align with CWE-824. However, the core issue leading to the vulnerability is the incorrect handling of memory after it has been freed, therefore CWE-416 is the primary. CWE-824 is less precise because the pointer within the allocated zero byte array is uninitialized which is not the root cause of the vulnerability, the access after free is the root cause, not the uninitialized state.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-824 is a base-level CWE. Accessing an uninitialized pointer can often lead to other memory corruption issues. It is a prerequisite for CWE-416 in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Supporting evidence suggests an uninitialized pointer is involved, but it's a contributing factor rather than the main weakness.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) is another secondary candidate because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions the root cause stems from an **incorrect calculation of buffer size** when processing a malformed IOCA file, specifically, when the `size_Y` value in the file is null, a zero-byte allocation occurs. While an incorrect buffer size calculation leads to the conditions that trigger the vulnerability, it is not the direct cause of the **memory corruption** which is from the **arbitrary free**. Therefore, while related, it's not as direct as CWE-416.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-131 is a base-level CWE. Incorrect buffer size calculations can lead to various memory-related vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows and use-after-free conditions.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Supporting evidence indicates an incorrect buffer size calculation, but this is a prerequisite condition, not the direct weakness).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682

ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
ParentOf -> CWE-467

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When allocating a buffer for the purpose of transforming, converting, or encoding an input, allocate enough memory to handle the largest possible encoding. For example, in a routine that converts "&" characters to "&amp;" for HTML entity encoding, the output buffer needs to be at least 5 times as large as the input buffer.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Understand the programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, "not-a-number" calculations, and how the language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. [REF-7]


Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This is a broad category. Some examples include:


  - simple math errors,

  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,

  - not accounting for size differences when "transforming" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. "expansion").

This level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.

**[Maintenance]** 

This weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.


This issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed
- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables



## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.
