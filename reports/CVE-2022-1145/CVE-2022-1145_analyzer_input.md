## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-1145:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* Use-after-free vulnerability

* Use-after-free: The vulnerability occurs due to a memory management issue where a pointer is used after the memory it points to has been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*  The provided content doesn't explicitly detail the full impact, but use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to various issues, including:
    *   Remote code execution (as mentioned in the Gentoo advisory, "the worst of which could result in remote code execution.")
    *   Denial of service (application crash).
    *   Information disclosure (leaking potentially sensitive memory contents).

**Attack vectors:**
* The specific attack vector is not explicitly stated in the provided text, however, the vulnerability is located in the Extensions component of the browser. The advisory states the vulnerability is remotely exploitable, implying that an attacker could potentially trigger the use-after-free through a malicious web page or extension.
