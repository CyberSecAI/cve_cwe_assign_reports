# Analysis for CVE-2022-33236

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**buffer over-read**" as the **rootcause** of the transient denial of service (DOS). This directly aligns with CWE-126, which is defined as "The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer." The vulnerability occurs while parsing cipher suite info attributes in WLAN firmware, indicating a specific context for the **buffer over-read**. CWE-126 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability also mentions parsing cipher suite info attributes. It's possible the size of this data is not validated before reading, which would cause a **buffer over-read**. This aligns with CWE-1284, which is defined as "The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a variant of the class CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 is a base level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "**buffer over-read**" and the alignment with the CWE description)
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Medium confidence because improper validation of quantity is just a possible cause to the over-read)
