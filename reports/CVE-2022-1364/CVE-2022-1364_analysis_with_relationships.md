# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-1364 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-843 | Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is explicitly described as a type confusion issue.|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.5 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Type confusion could lead to use-after-free conditions, although this is not explicitly stated. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **type confusion** in the V8 Turbofan component of Google Chrome. This aligns directly with CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')), which describes a scenario where a resource is accessed using a type incompatible with its original type. The CVE reference confirms this, stating "Type Confusion in V8". CWE-843 is a Base level CWE and its Usage is Allowed, making it a suitable primary mapping. The impact, **heap corruption**, is a common consequence of type confusion. While not explicitly stated, a type confusion could lead to a use-after-free condition.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-843 is a child of CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast). It is also a peer of itself, implying that multiple instances of type confusion can interact. There is no direct chain relationship, but type confusion can lead to memory corruption issues.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and CVE reference)
