## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates that a **session identifier** is **unsafely present in HTML output**. This is a clear case of **sensitive information disclosure**, specifically the transmission of sensitive information (the session ID) to an actor (a user viewing the HTML source) who should not have access to it. This aligns directly with CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data], where the code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes **sensitive information** that should not be accessible to that actor. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further validates this by stating that the vulnerability results in **Sensitive Information Disclosure** because the `CsrfTokenViewHelper` exposes the user's session identifier without proper cryptographic hashing. CWE-201 is a base level CWE, which is appropriate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], but CWE-201 is more specific because it identifies that the sensitive information is being sent in data. The Retriever Results lists CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data] with a score of 0.2740. CWE-319 [Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information] could be a secondary mapping, as the session identifier is exposed in cleartext (unhashed). While the primary concern is the disclosure, the lack of encryption on the session ID is a contributing factor. However, since the primary issue is the inclusion in the output and not necessarily the transmission itself, it is a secondary consideration.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
