# Final Resolution for CVE-2021-4079

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. Crafted WebRTC packets bypass input validation, leading to an **out-of-bounds write**, and subsequent heap corruption. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is triggered by crafted packets that lack proper validation. Specifically, the size parameters within the packets are not correctly validated. |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.60 | Variant | Allowed | Contributing Factor. The **out-of-bounds write** corrupts the heap, and *may* be due to overflowing a heap allocated buffer. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) which is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The crafted WebRTC packets causing the issue suggest a lack of input validation, specifically related to the size or quantity specified in the input. This maps to CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). The **heap corruption** mentioned in the vulnerability description can be a result of the **out-of-bounds write**, suggesting CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as a contributing factor. Therefore, CWE-787 leads to **heap corruption** which makes CWE-122 a consequence of CWE-787.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with crafted WebRTC packets being received by the system. The system fails to properly validate the size parameters within these packets (CWE-1284). This lack of validation allows an **out-of-bounds write** to occur (CWE-787), where data is written past the end of the allocated buffer. This **out-of-bounds write** then leads to **heap corruption** (potentially manifesting as CWE-122).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified CWE-787 as the primary weakness. The criticism suggested refining the analysis by considering the chain of events and the role of input validation. The vulnerability description states "Out of bounds write in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.93 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via crafted WebRTC packets." This provides clear evidence for CWE-787 and implicates crafted packets, suggesting missing or inadequate input validation (CWE-1284).

The relationships between the CWEs support the final selection. CWE-787 is the **root cause**, leading to the **heap corruption** (CWE-122). CWE-1284, while not directly causing the **out-of-bounds write**, allows the crafted packets to reach the vulnerable code, making it a significant contributing factor.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-787 is a Base-level CWE, providing a clear description of the **out-of-bounds write**. CWE-122 is a Variant, specifying that the buffer overflow occurs on the heap. CWE-1284 pinpoints the lack of input validation on the size parameters of the input.
