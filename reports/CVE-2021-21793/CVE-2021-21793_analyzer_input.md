# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21793

## Vulnerability Description
An **out-of-bounds write** vulnerability exists in the JPG sof_nb_comp header processing functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.8 and 19.9. A specially crafted malformed file can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **out-of-bounds write**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **vector:** specially crafted malformed file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Accusoft ImageGear
- **version:** 19.8 and 19.9
- **component:** JPG sof_nb_comp header processing functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing size check when allocating a buffer for color table data during JPG image processing, specifically when handling the `sof_nb_comp` header. The size of the buffer is calculated based on a value read directly from the file. If this value is null, a very small buffer (1 byte) is allocated. Subsequently, during the processing of this data, a loop iterates based on the same value from the file, leading to out-of-bounds write when writing to a memory location exceeding the allocated buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Out-of-bounds write
    - Incorrect buffer size calculation
    - Missing null check on the size of the buffer allocated.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Memory corruption, which could lead to code execution.
    - Application crash (demonstrated by the provided crash information)
- **Attack vectors**:
    - By providing a specially crafted malicious JPG file to a vulnerable application using the affected Accusoft ImageGear library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted JPG file to an application that utilizes the vulnerable library.

The report provides in-depth technical details, including the code snippet of the vulnerable functions, memory allocation information, and a detailed crash report, offering more than the typical CVE description.
