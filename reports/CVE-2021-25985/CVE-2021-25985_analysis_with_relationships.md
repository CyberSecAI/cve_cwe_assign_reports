# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-25985 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | The application does not properly invalidate user sessions after logout. |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Session tokens are stored in local storage, making them vulnerable to XSS attacks. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary weakness is **insufficient session expiration (CWE-613)**. The vulnerability description states the application "improperly invalidate a users session even after the user logs out of the application" and that "user sessions are stored in the browsers local storage, which by default does not have an expiration time." This aligns directly with CWE-613, which describes a scenario where a website permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating "The application does not properly invalidate user sessions after logout and stores them in the browser's local storage without an expiration time."
  The secondary weakness is **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)**, since "user sessions are stored in the browsers local storage, which by default does not have an expiration time. This makes it possible for an attacker to steal and reuse the cookies using techniques such as XSS attacks, followed by a local account takeover".
  CWE-613 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-613 is related to weaknesses like CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). It can also be a contributing factor to CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) if an attacker reuses an unexpired session to bypass authentication.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear evidence in the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials). The retriever results also had a high score for CWE-613, further increasing confidence.
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence due to clear evidence in the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials). The retriever results also had a high score for CWE-79, further increasing confidence.
