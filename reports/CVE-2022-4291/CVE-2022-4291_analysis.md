## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap corruption**" in the `aswjsflt.dll` library of Avast Antivirus. This directly indicates a memory corruption issue within the heap. The CVE reference summary further reinforces this by stating the root cause is a "heap corruption vulnerability." CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) specifically addresses buffer overflows that occur in the heap, making it a highly relevant and accurate classification. While other CWEs like CWE-119 (Buffer Overflow) exist, CWE-122 provides a more specific classification by pinpointing the heap as the location of the overflow.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Buffer Overflow), providing a more specific categorization. It also has relationships with other memory corruption CWEs, highlighting the interconnected nature of memory safety issues. This aligns with the description of heap corruption leading to a bypass of the application's sandbox, indicating potential further exploits related to memory management.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "heap corruption" in both the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary.)
