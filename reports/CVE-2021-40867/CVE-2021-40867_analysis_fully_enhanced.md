## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability is an **authentication hijacking race-condition** because the HTTP authentication process is effectively tied only to the source IP address. This aligns well with CWE-291, Reliance on IP Address for Authentication, which is a Variant level CWE and ALLOWED. The CVE description mentions that the `get.cgi` handler relies solely on the client IP and a guessable browser type number for verification, confirming the use of IP address for authentication. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also relevant because the system doesn't properly authenticate users, allowing unauthenticated access. CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) is also relevant because an attacker can spoof the IP address to bypass authentication. However, CWE-291 is the most specific and appropriate because it directly addresses the **reliance on IP address** which is the root cause. The suggested fix is to use a cryptographically secure random value for the result file name, which should then be passed as a token and used for subsequent get.cgi requests, this indicates the need for proper authentication mechanisms."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-291 is a variant of CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing), and CWE-290 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The relationships suggest a hierarchy of authentication weaknesses, but CWE-291 is chosen for its specificity to the reliance on IP addresses. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) can be related as it describes the absence of proper authentication."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

- **CVE-2009-1048** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1048](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1048): VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-29280**: In TP-Link Wireless N Router WR840N an ARP poisoning attack can cause buffer overflow
- **CVE-2021-0232**: An authentication bypass vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center may allow an attacker with specific information about the deployment to mimic an already registered Test Agent and access its configuration including associated inventory details. If the issue occurs, the affected Test Agent will not be able to connect to the Control Center. This issue affects Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center All versions prior to 2.35.6; 2.36 versions prior to 2.36.2.
- **CVE-2021-22779**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing vulnerability exists in EcoStruxure Control Expert (all versions prior to V15.0 SP1, including all versions of Unity Pro), EcoStruxure Control Expert V15.0 SP1, EcoStruxure Process Expert (all versions, including all versions of EcoStruxure Hybrid DCS), SCADAPack RemoteConnect for x70 (all versions), Modicon M580 CPU (all versions - part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*), Modicon M340 CPU (all versions - part numbers BMXP34*), that could cause unauthorized access in read and write mode to the controller by spoofing the Modbus communication between the engineering software and the controller.
- **CVE-2020-19003**: An issue in Gate One 1.2.0 allows attackers to bypass to the verification check done by the origins list and connect to Gate One instances used by hosts not on the origins list.
- **CVE-2020-22001**: HomeAutomation 3.3.2 suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability when spoofing client IP address using the X-Forwarded-For header with the local (loopback) IP address value allowing remote control of the smart home solution.
- **CVE-2021-22002**: VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager, allow the /cfg web app and diagnostic endpoints, on port 8443, to be accessed via port 443 using a custom host header. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 could tamper with host headers to facilitate access to the /cfg web app, in addition a malicious actor could access /cfg diagnostic endpoints without authentication.
- **CVE-2021-23008**: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.4, 12.1.x before 12.1.6, and all versions of 16.0.x and 11.6.x., BIG-IP APM AD (Active Directory) authentication can be bypassed via a spoofed AS-REP (Kerberos Authentication Service Response) response sent over a hijacked KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) connection or from an AD server compromised by an attacker. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.
- **CVE-2021-41753**: A denial-of-service attack in WPA2, and WPA3-SAE authentication methods in D-Link DIR-X1560, v1.04B04, and DIR-X6060, v1.11B04 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to disconnect a wireless client via sending specific spoofed SAE authentication frames.
