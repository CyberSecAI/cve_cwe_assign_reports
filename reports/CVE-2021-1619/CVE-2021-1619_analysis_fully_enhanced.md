|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-457 | Use of Uninitialized Variable | 0.9 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.4 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is caused by an **uninitialized variable** in the AAA function of Cisco IOS XE Software. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially cause memory corruption leading to DoS or install/manipulate device configurations. CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable) directly addresses the root cause. The CVE description clearly states: "This vulnerability is due to an **uninitialized variable**". The retriever results also list CWE-457 with a high score (0.921), further supporting this classification. While the impact includes authentication bypass and DoS, the root cause is the **uninitialized variable**, making CWE-457 the primary weakness. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a plausible secondary candidate since memory corruption can lead to resource exhaustion and DoS. However, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and is often misused, so a more precise CWE targeting the root cause is preferred. The successful exploit can allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-457 is a variant of CWE-667 (Improper Initialization). The impacts of this vulnerability (authentication bypass, DoS) can lead to other CWEs such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) or CWE-400. The vulnerability enables an attacker to "bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication", which is a failure in authentication. This indicates an authentication weakness, and CWE-306 could be considered as a possible weakness to map.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence for CWE-457 due to direct mention in the description. Medium confidence for CWE-400 and CWE-306 due to impact analysis.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1619**: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.
- **CVE-2021-41253**: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.
- **CVE-2021-21140**: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.
- **CVE-2021-44003**: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5). The Tiff_Loader.dll is vulnerable to use of uninitialized memory while parsing user supplied TIFF files. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.
