# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-42740

## Vulnerability Description
The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows **command injection**. An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper escaping of shell metacharacters**
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary commands
- **vector:** inject unescaped shell metacharacters
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** shell-quote package
- **version:** before 1.7.3
