## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-26567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `frontend/main.c` file of `faad2` before version 2.2.7.1
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when handling filename and pathname options in the `main` function. Specifically, the vulnerability is present when allocating space for `audioFileName`, `adtsFileName` and `aacFileName` variables using `malloc`, based on the length of input parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing crafted filenames or pathnames as command-line arguments to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be local to the system where the vulnerable `faad2` application is running
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code/applications with the privileges of the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The github content provides a code diff showing the allocation of the vulnerable buffers in `frontend/main.c`. It shows that the filename buffers are dynamically allocated but it does not seem to show the vulnerable part of the code in `faad2`.
- The Synology advisory provides a good description of the vulnerability, it mentions `filename and pathname options` as attack vectors.
