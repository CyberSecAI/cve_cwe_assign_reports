| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-602 | Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security | 0.65 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application only enforces restrictions on user self-registration in the front-end. This allows attackers to bypass these restrictions by directly accessing the signup URL. This aligns with CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], where the application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs. The **Improper Access Control** allows "guest" role users to self-register even when the admin does not allow it.
  - The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states the root cause is that "The application only implements the restriction of user self-registration in the front-end, allowing bypassing by directly accessing the signup URL." This confirms that the authorization check is not performed on the server-side, leading to the bypass.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-425 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for mapping. It is related to other authorization CWEs but is the most appropriate in this scenario, as it directly addresses the issue of inadequate enforcement of authorization on specific URLs. CWE-425's mapping guidance indicates it is ALLOWED for such cases.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the clear description of the root cause and the direct match with CWE-425 characteristics.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
   - *Explanation:* While CWE-425 is the primary weakness, CWE-602 [Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security] is a contributing factor. The reliance on front-end restrictions without server-side validation perfectly embodies the concept of client-side enforcement of security measures that should be handled server-side. The vulnerability description explicitly states "This happens due to front-end restriction only".
   - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-602 is a Class level CWE and the mapping guidance suggests it might have more appropriate Base-level children, but in this case, it accurately describes the high-level issue of trusting the client for security enforcement. The relationship analysis also reveals that CWE-602 can precede CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data), indicating that the client-side enforcement can lead to data manipulation vulnerabilities. However, the evidence is not strong enough to include CWE-471.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium confidence as it is a Class-level CWE and depends on the interpretation of front-end only restrictions, but it supports the main finding)



## Known Examples for CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-33139** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-33139](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-33139): SCADA system only uses client-side authentication, allowing adversaries to impersonate other users.
- **CVE-2006-6994** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6994](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6994): ASP program allows upload of .asp files by bypassing client-side checks.
- **CVE-2007-0163** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0163](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0163): steganography products embed password information in the carrier file, which can be extracted from a modified client.
- **CVE-2007-0164** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0164](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0164): steganography products embed password information in the carrier file, which can be extracted from a modified client.

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-25973**: In Publify, 9.0.0.pre1 to 9.2.4 are vulnerable to Improper Access Control. “guest” role users can self-register even when the admin does not allow. This happens due to front-end restriction only.
- **CVE-2020-24264**: Portainer 1.24.1 and earlier is affected by incorrect access control that may lead to remote arbitrary code execution. The restriction checks for bind mounts are applied only on the client-side and not the server-side, which can lead to spawning a container with bind mount. Once such a container is spawned, it can be leveraged to break out of the container leading to complete Docker host machine takeover.
- **CVE-2021-30120**: Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows attackers to bypass the 2FA requirement. The need to use 2FA for authentication in enforce client-side instead of server-side and can be bypassed using a local proxy. Thus rendering 2FA useless. Detailed description --- During the login process, after the user authenticates with username and password, the server sends a response to the client with the booleans MFARequired and MFAEnroled. If the attacker has obtained a password of a user and used an intercepting proxy (e.g. Burp Suite) to change the value of MFARequered from True to False, there is no prompt for the second factor, but the user is still logged in.
- **CVE-2021-24602**: The HM Multiple Roles WordPress plugin before 1.3 does not have any access control to prevent low privilege users to set themselves as admin via their profile page
- **CVE-2021-45891**: An issue was discovered in Softwarebuero Zauner ARC 4.2.0.4., that allows attackers to escalate privileges within the application, since all permission checks are done client-side, not server-side.
