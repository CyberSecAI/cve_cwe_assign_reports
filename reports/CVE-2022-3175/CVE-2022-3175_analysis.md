# Analysis for CVE-2022-3175

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.8 | Base | Primary | The application's default error page leaks stack trace information, revealing sensitive details. |
| CWE-756 | Missing Custom Error Page | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | The absence of a custom error page causes the default error page to be displayed, which exposes the stack trace. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the default error page in the application leaks stack trace information. This aligns directly with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), as the stack trace contains sensitive details about the application's internal workings, system paths, and code logic. The **rootcause** is an **improper redirect** to the default error page. CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page) is a contributing factor, as the application uses the default error page due to the absence of a custom one. The impact of the vulnerability is information disclosure, which could aid an attacker in further attacks. The retriever results also show a high score for CWE-209. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-209 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) is a base level CWE. It is related to CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page) because the missing custom error page leads to the display of the default error page, which contains sensitive information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
