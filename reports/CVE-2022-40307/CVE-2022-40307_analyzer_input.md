# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-40307

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.19.8. drivers/firmware/efi/capsule-loader.c has a **race condition** with a resultant **use-after-free**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** through 5.19.8
- **component:** drivers/firmware/efi/capsule-loader.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-40307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the EFI capsule-loader driver. Specifically, the race occurs between the `efi_capsule_write()` and `efi_capsule_flush()` functions, which leads to a use-after-free (UAF) condition.
- The vulnerability is due to the page freeing process being handled in `efi_capsule_flush()` which can be called concurrently during a write operation in `efi_capsule_write()`. The fix moves the page freeing logic to `efi_capsule_release()` which is called upon file close, resolving the race.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to the capsule loader's internal data structures without proper synchronization.
- **Use-After-Free:** A memory region is freed while still being referenced by the `efi_capsule_write` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crash or memory corruption can occur, causing the system to become unstable or unresponsive.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation could potentially lead to privilege escalation, although this is less certain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Device Access:** The attacker must have permission to access the `/dev/efi_capsule_loader` device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The attacker typically requires root privileges to access the `/dev/efi_capsule_loader` device. However, the vulnerability can potentially be exploited even without root, if access to the device can be obtained.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves moving the memory freeing operation from `efi_capsule_flush()` to `efi_capsule_release()`. This is triggered when the device is closed which prevents the use-after-free.
- The provided commit (9cb636b) specifically addresses this UAF by modifying the location of the memory release, which is part of the fix.
- The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel.
