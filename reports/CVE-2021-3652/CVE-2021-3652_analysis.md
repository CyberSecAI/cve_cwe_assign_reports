# Analysis for CVE-2021-3652

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The system's use of '*' as a password hash is a **weakness** that allows any password to authenticate successfully. |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.60 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability leads to bypassing authentication. |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.45 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. An asterisk ('*') is being used as a password hash. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability involves the improper handling of asterisk characters ('*') when used as password hashes in 389-ds-base. Instead of treating the asterisk as an invalid or disabled password, the system allows any password to authenticate successfully. This aligns with CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) because the asterisk effectively bypasses the intended password hashing mechanism. The CVE reference summaries directly state that the root cause is the incorrect handling of the asterisk as a crypted password hash and that the system fails to properly handle an asterisk as a password hash, leading to an authentication bypass. CWE-916 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for this root cause."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is a base level CWE. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) could be considered, it is a class level CWE and discouraged, and CWE-916 is a more specific and accurate description of the **weakness**. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is also a consideration because the '*' is like a hardcoded bypass, however, this also relates to the hashing mechanism and is therefore less accurate than CWE-916."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
