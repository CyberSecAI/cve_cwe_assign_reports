**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read/write due to improper buffer handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code of their choice on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack (AV:L): The vulnerability is exploitable locally on the user's machine.
- Requires User Interaction (UI:R): Exploitation necessitates some form of user interaction, such as opening a maliciously crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the user's machine.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious file or perform some other action that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS base score of 7.8.
- The affected product is Adobe Audition versions 14.4 and earlier.
