## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.65
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions "**memory corruption** in video due to **configuration weakness**". The term "**memory corruption**" can stem from several underlying issues. Based on the Retriever Results, CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) has the highest combined score and is a plausible root cause if the "configuration weakness" leads to an untrusted value being used as a pointer. CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset) is also considered as a possible root cause for **memory corruption** related to video processing. Finally, CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) is related to improper handling of indices/offsets in video processing, which could also cause the **memory corruption**.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-822, CWE-823, and CWE-1285 are all base-level CWEs. There are no direct relationships evident in the provided text, but the retriever results suggest potential relationships as memory corruption can be a complex issue with several contributing factors.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Low evidence from the description, relying on retriever results and general knowledge of memory corruption vulnerabilities)
