# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-823 | Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**unsafe access to data members**" leading to "memory corruption". This suggests that the code is accessing memory in an unsafe manner. Among the retriever results, CWE-823 "Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset" appears to be the most relevant. CWE-823 describes a situation where pointer arithmetic is performed on a valid pointer, but the offset used can point outside the intended range of valid memory locations. The phrase "**unsafe access to data members**" directly maps to this concept of accessing memory locations outside the intended bounds, especially when dealing with data members of an object or structure. This leads to memory corruption. It's a base level CWE, which is preferred. The "Usage" is "Allowed".

  - *Relationship Analysis:* The retriever results show that CWE-823 is related to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). It is also related to CWE-119.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (The vulnerability description directly mentions unsafe access, and CWE-823 aligns well with this. There is no CVE Reference Links Content Summary for more evidence.)
