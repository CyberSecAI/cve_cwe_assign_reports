# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

| CWE-425 | Missing Required Authorization | 0.6 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**command injection**" in the web UI and API endpoints of Cisco APIC, which directly aligns with CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command). The description also indicates that a remote attacker could execute system commands, further supporting the choice of CWE-78. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section lists CWE-78 as the primary match and the top CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-78 with a high score.
  - *Explanation:* CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a potential secondary weakness because **command injection** often stems from a failure to properly validate user input. However, the description focuses more on the **command injection** itself rather than general input validation issues. Since CWE-20 is a high-level class and the description is more specific, CWE-78 is a better primary fit. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" lists CWE-20 as one of the top CWEs.
  - *Explanation:* The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" of CVE-2021-1581 indicates "Improper access control in an API endpoint of Cisco APIC or Cisco Cloud APIC" and "Lack of proper access control allows for unauthorized file uploads". This suggests CWE-425 (Missing Required Authorization) could be a contributing factor. However, the primary vulnerability described is **command injection**. The provided vulnerability description doesn't give enough detail to determine whether there is a missing authorization.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Command Injection). It is also related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). CWE-20 is a class-level CWE, and its usage is discouraged when a more specific CWE is available.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *CWE-78 Confidence:* 0.9 (High confidence due to direct mention of command injection and execution of system commands)
  - *CWE-20 Confidence:* 0.6 (Medium confidence as it is a general weakness that could contribute to the command injection)
  - *CWE-425 Confidence:* 0.6 (Medium confidence as it is related to unauthorized file uploads, based on CVE-2021-1581, but is not the primary focus)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-15180**: A flaw was found in the mysql-wsrep component of mariadb. Lack of input sanitization in `wsrep_sst_method` allows for command injection that can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on galera cluster nodes. This threatens the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This flaw affects mariadb versions before 10.1.47, before 10.2.34, before 10.3.25, before 10.4.15 and before 10.5.6.
