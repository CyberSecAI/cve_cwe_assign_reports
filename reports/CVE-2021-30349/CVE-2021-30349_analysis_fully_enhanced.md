| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description highlights an **improper access control sequence for the AC database after memory allocation**, which can lead to memory corruption. This suggests that a race condition (CWE-367) might exist where the access control is checked, but the state of the memory changes before it is used, leading to incorrect access and potential memory corruption. The description mentions memory allocation, which means an incorrect calculation of buffer size (CWE-131) can be the root cause of the memory corruption. The vulnerability might involve an **improper validation of index, position, or offset in input** (CWE-1285). Finally, memory corruption may lead to writing outside the bounds of intended memory (CWE-787).

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-367 is a Base level CWE, representing the Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition. CWE-1285 is also Base level, representing Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input, which can potentially lead to an out-of-bounds write. CWE-131 is Base level and represents Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size and can lead to memory corruption. CWE-787 is also Base level and represents Out-of-bounds Write.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.70 (Medium evidence due to the general description, more information needed for a more definitive assessment)

## Known Examples for CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743): TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813): A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594): PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.
- **CVE-2008-2958** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
- **CVE-2008-1570** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1921**: Possible memory corruption due to Improper handling of hypervisor unmap operations for concurrent memory operations in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2021-29657**: arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.
- **CVE-2020-11233**: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition While processing partition entries due to newly created buffer was read again from mmc without validation in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables
- **CVE-2020-13882**: CISOfy Lynis before 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU race condition. The routine to check the log and report file permissions was not working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the race, an unprivileged attacker can set up a log and report file, and control that up to the point where the specific routine is doing its check. After that, the file can be removed, recreated, and used for additional attacks.
- **CVE-2020-15702**: TOCTOU Race Condition vulnerability in apport allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may exit the crashed process and exploit PID recycling to spawn a root process with the same PID as the crashed process, which can then be used to escalate privileges. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9 versions prior to 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.16 and 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.6. Was ZDI-CAN-11234.
