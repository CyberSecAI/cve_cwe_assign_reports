# Analysis for CVE-2020-11284

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-413 | Improper Resource Locking | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource. |
| CWE-1274 | Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product conducts a secure-boot process that transfers bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) into Volatile Memory (VM), but it does not have sufficient access control or other protections for the Volatile Memory. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that locked memory can be unlocked and modified by a non-secure boot loader due to an **improper system call sequence**. This aligns with CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) because the memory region is not properly locked, allowing unauthorized access. CWE-1274 (Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code) is also relevant because it deals with access control issues within the secure boot process, specifically for volatile memory. The **improper system call sequence** likely bypasses the intended access controls. However, the root cause seems to be a locking issue (or lack thereof) and volatile memory access.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-413 is a Base level CWE and there isn't a clear parent or child relationship to other CWEs that are directly applicable here. CWE-1274 is also a Base level CWE and doesn't have any direct relationships that significantly alter the mapping decision in this context."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate evidence from the description, supplemented by the Retriever results. Further details of the system call sequence would strengthen the mapping.)
