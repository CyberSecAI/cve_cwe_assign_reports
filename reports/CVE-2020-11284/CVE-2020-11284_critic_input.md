# Analysis to Review
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-413 | Improper Resource Locking | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource. |
| CWE-1274 | Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product conducts a secure-boot process that transfers bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) into Volatile Memory (VM), but it does not have sufficient access control or other protections for the Volatile Memory. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that locked memory can be unlocked and modified by a non-secure boot loader due to an **improper system call sequence**. This aligns with CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) because the memory region is not properly locked, allowing unauthorized access. CWE-1274 (Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code) is also relevant because it deals with access control issues within the secure boot process, specifically for volatile memory. The **improper system call sequence** likely bypasses the intended access controls. However, the root cause seems to be a locking issue (or lack thereof) and volatile memory access.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-413 is a Base level CWE and there isn't a clear parent or child relationship to other CWEs that are directly applicable here. CWE-1274 is also a Base level CWE and doesn't have any direct relationships that significantly alter the mapping decision in this context."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate evidence from the description, supplemented by the Retriever results. Further details of the system call sequence would strengthen the mapping.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product conducts a secure-boot process that transfers bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) into Volatile Memory (VM), but it does not have sufficient access control or other protections for the Volatile Memory.

### Extended Description


Adversaries could bypass the secure-boot process and execute their own untrusted, malicious boot code.


As a part of a secure-boot process, the read-only-memory (ROM) code for a System-on-Chip (SoC) or other system fetches bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and stores the code in Volatile Memory (VM), such as dynamic, random-access memory (DRAM) or static, random-access memory (SRAM). The NVM is usually external to the SoC, while the VM is internal to the SoC. As the code is transferred from NVM to VM, it is authenticated by the SoC's ROM code.


If the volatile-memory-region protections or access controls are insufficient to prevent modifications from an adversary or untrusted agent, the secure boot may be bypassed or replaced with the execution of an adversary's code.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that the design of volatile-memory protections is enough to prevent modification from an adversary or untrusted code.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Testing
- **Description:** Test the volatile-memory protections to ensure they are safe from modification or untrusted code.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-2267:** Locked memory regions may be modified through other interfaces in a secure-boot-loader image due to improper access control.



## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

### Extended Description
When a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-667
ParentOf -> CWE-591

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use a non-conflicting privilege scheme.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Use synchronization when locking a resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
