# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-35105

## Vulnerability Description
SWFTools commit 772e55a2 was discovered to contain a **heap-buffer overflow** via /bin/png2swf+0x552cea.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-buffer overflow**
- **product:** SWFTools
- **version:** commit 772e55a2
- **component:** /bin/png2swf+0x552cea

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is heap-based buffer overflows and a segmentation fault (SEGV) triggered within the `png2swf` utility of the `swftools` project when processing crafted PNG files. The vulnerabilities occur due to incorrect handling of image data and chunk parsing within the png library used by `png2swf`. Specifically, the issues are located in: `png_read_header`, and `png_load` functions

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflows: Multiple instances of heap-based buffer overflows are reported in the `png_read_header` and `png_load` functions. These occur when the program reads beyond the allocated memory region while processing a malformed PNG file.
- Segmentation fault (SEGV): A segmentation fault is reported within the `png_load` function. This indicates a critical memory access violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The crashes caused by the heap buffer overflows and segmentation fault result in the termination of the `png2swf` process, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: While not explicitly confirmed, heap buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution under certain circumstances if the attacker controls the overflowed data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted PNG files: The vulnerabilities are triggered by providing specially crafted PNG files as input to the `png2swf` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious PNG file to the vulnerable `png2swf` utility.
- No specific privilege is needed to trigger the crashes, as they occur during the processing of the file.
- The attacker does not need to be in a specific position other than being able to execute the `png2swf` command.

**Additional details:**
- The provided information includes AddressSanitizer (ASAN) reports which precisely indicate the location and type of the memory corruption.
- The reports include the exact line numbers and function names where the errors occurred, which can be used for fixing the vulnerabilities.
- Multiple crash examples with different crafted files are provided which are all related to heap buffer overflows and one SEGV.
