- **version:** Versions 3.30_24518 and prior

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-43556:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. It occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121):**  The software copies data of an uncontrolled size into a fixed-size stack buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specific file types: TAB, PDW, and SPF files.
*   An attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create or provide a malicious file (TAB, PDW, or SPF) that contains specially crafted data.
*   User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability. The victim has to open the malicious file using the vulnerable software.

**Affected Products:**
*   Fatek Automation WinProladder (Versions 3.30_24518 and prior)

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in the parsing of TAB, PDW, and SPF files. Each file type represents a different vulnerability with the same root cause and impact.
* The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   Fatek Automation has released an update to fix this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson) and xina1i, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.

This information provides a detailed view of the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability described by CVE-2021-43556, including its causes, impacts, and attack vectors. The different file types (TAB, PDW, and SPF) each have their own advisory but are related to the same CVE.
