## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer". This indicates a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption issue where the program tries to read/write data outside the allocated memory region.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer:** This is the specific weakness that allows an attacker to write outside of the allocated buffer leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local (`AV:L`).
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (`AC:L`).
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't require any privileges (`PR:N`)
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction (`UI:R`). Specifically, the user would likely need to open a malicious file using the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker could be a malicious user on the same system, or could be a remote attacker who is able to convince the user to open the crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Adobe, indicating a high level of severity.
- The CVSS base score is 7.8.
- The vulnerability exists in Adobe Character Animator 2021 versions 4.4 and earlier.
- It is patched in version 4.4.2 for Character Animator 2021 and version 22.0 for Character Animator 2022
