| CWE-303 | Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm | 0.65 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states an **Improper Authentication** vulnerability. The CVE reference links content summary confirms this, stating that the root cause involves an overlapping of patches leading to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the salt-api. This aligns with CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which describes a situation where the product does not sufficiently prove that a claimed identity is correct. While CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the provided information lacks the specificity to pinpoint a more precise Base or Variant level CWE related to authentication bypasses or specific authentication algorithm weaknesses. The description does not give information on the specific implementation flaw only that authentication is not properly handled. For example, more information would be needed to select CWE-303."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-287 is a Class-level weakness, and many child CWEs exist that provide more specific details. For example, CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass) and CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name). Without more specific information it's difficult to select a more specific CWE. CWE-287 CanPrecede many other weaknesses, highlighting the potential for a chain of vulnerabilities following an authentication bypass."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct mention of "Improper Authentication" and confirmation in CVE details.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm) is a possible secondary weakness. The CVE summary indicates a patch overlap led to the **unauthenticated** issue. It's possible the original patch intended to implement a specific authentication algorithm, but the overlap resulted in an incorrect implementation. However, this is speculative as it is not explicitly stated. Without more details on the implementation, it is impossible to say if an authentication algorithm was used and implemented incorrectly."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-303 is a Base level weakness. There aren't any direct relationships provided for this CWE. However, it would potentially be a child of CWE-287, but that relationship information is not available."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium confidence, based on the possibility of an authentication algorithm being implemented incorrectly, but lacking explicit evidence)



## Known Examples for CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1179** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1179](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1179): Router allows remote attackers to read system logs without authentication by directly connecting to the login screen and typing certain control characters.
- **CVE-1999-1454** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1454](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1454): Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.
- **CVE-1999-1077** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1077](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1077): OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.
- **CVE-2003-0304** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0304](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0304): Direct request of installation file allows attacker to create administrator accounts.
- **CVE-2002-0870** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0870](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0870): Attackers may gain additional privileges by directly requesting the web management URL.
- **CVE-2002-0066** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0066](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0066): Bypass authentication via direct request to named pipe.
- **CVE-2003-1035** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1035](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1035): User can avoid lockouts by using an API instead of the GUI to conduct brute force password guessing.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-36308**: Networking OS10, versions prior to October 2021 with Smart Fabric Services enabled, contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access and perform actions on the affected system.
- **CVE-2021-41292**: ECOA BAS controller suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker through cookie poisoning can remotely bypass authentication and disclose sensitive information and circumvent physical access controls in smart homes and buildings and manipulate HVAC.
- **CVE-2021-30867**: The issue was addressed with improved authentication. This issue is fixed in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. A malicious application may be able to access photo metadata without needing permission to access photos.
