| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write  | 1.0        | Base                  | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as an **Out-of-bounds Write**, which directly corresponds to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating "Access of memory location after end of buffer" as the root cause, and explicitly listing CWE-788. However, CWE-787 is a more direct fit for writing past the end of a buffer, while CWE-788 involves accessing a memory location after the end of the buffer, which could be either a read or a write. Thus, CWE-787 is more precise. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting this **out-of-bounds write**, aligning with the typical consequences of this weakness. MITRE's mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-787.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE. It is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a class-level CWE and thus less specific. CWE-787 can lead to various impacts, including code execution.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE definition, supported by CVE reference and retriever results).
