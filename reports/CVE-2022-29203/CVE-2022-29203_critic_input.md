# Critic Input for CVE-2022-29203



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` (in all backends such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an **integer overflow** The result of this **integer overflow** is used to allocate the output tensor, hence we get a denial of service via a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as in TFSA-2021-198. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **vector:** assertion failure
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **version:** prior to 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4
- **component:** tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29203:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND`. This overflow occurs when calculating the output tensor's size.

**Weaknesses:**

- Integer Overflow: The code multiplies dimensions of the input tensor with the block shape without proper checks to prevent overflows. If the result is a negative number, a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure) occurs, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability can cause a denial of service due to the assertion failure (CHECK-failure), which crashes the application. The process is terminated unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious Input: An attacker can craft specific input tensors and `block_shape` parameters to `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` that will cause an integer overflow when calculating the output tensor's dimensions, leading to the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` operation, specifically the `block_shape` parameter. This could be achieved by providing manipulated data to a TensorFlow model that uses this operation.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `SpaceToBatchND` operation which is used to rearrange data within a tensor. The output shape is calculated based on input shape, block shape, and paddings.
- Integer overflows happen in the calculation of `block_num_elems` and `output_dim`.
- The fix involves adding checks that ensure block dimensions are positive and that intermediate and output dimensions are positive after multiplication, preventing the overflow and subsequent crash.

**Patches:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.6.4, 2.7.2, 2.8.1, and 2.9.0. The fix is also present in commit `acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf`.
- The patch adds checks to ensure the product of the block dimensions is positive and the output dimension is non-negative. This prevents the integer overflow that leads to the crash.
- Shape inference was also updated with `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` function to avoid integer overflow.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is an **integer overflow** in the `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` function within TensorFlow. The integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of the output tensor, leading to a denial of service due to an assertion failure. This aligns directly with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by explicitly stating "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow". MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-190 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a Base level weakness, which is appropriate for directly mapping to the root cause of this vulnerability. There are no direct parent-child relationships that would suggest a more specific CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a possible secondary weakness. The vulnerability occurs because the dimensions of the input tensor and block shape are multiplied without proper validation to prevent overflows. This could be seen as a failure to properly validate the size/quantity of the input data. However, the primary issue is the integer overflow itself, making CWE-190 more directly relevant.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 is a Base level weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Sufficient evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
ParentOf -> CWE-680

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Ensure that all protocols are strictly defined, such that all out-of-bounds behavior can be identified simply, and require strict conformance to the protocol.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


If possible, choose a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Use libraries or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences.


Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++). [REF-106]




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.



## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read
