# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1437

## Vulnerability Description
**Heap-based Buffer Overflow** in GitHub repository radareorg/radare2 prior to 5.7.0. The bug causes the program reads data past the end of the intented buffer. Typically, this can allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from issues within the symbol parsing logic of radare2, specifically in how it handles symbol information in Mach-O files and a related out-of-bounds read issue. There were two specific issues:

1.  **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The `r_coresym_cache_element_new` function in `libr/bin/format/mach0/coresymbolication.c` had an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing the string table. If the `file_name_off` offset was close to or beyond the end of the buffer, the `str_dup_safe` function could read out of bounds.
2.  **Null Dereference:** The `symbols` function in `libr/bin/p/bin_symbols.c` contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability. If the code encounters a null symbol, the code would try to dereference the symbol which is a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** Accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Null pointer dereference:** Attempting to access a memory location through a null pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact of both vulnerabilities is a crash of the radare2 program. The out-of-bounds read can lead to unpredictable behavior and a crash. The null pointer dereference will also cause the program to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Mach-O File:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by parsing specially crafted Mach-O files that have a malformed symbol table, specifically by manipulating the offset to file names or by creating null symbols within the symbol tables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Mach-O file to radare2. This could happen if the user opens a malicious file or processes a file from a potentially untrusted source.
