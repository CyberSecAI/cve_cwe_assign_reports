| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Acceptable-Use |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a heap **buffer overflow** in ANGLE in Google Chrome. The key phrase "Heap **buffer overflow**" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states "Heap buffer overflow", strongly suggest CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and a specific type of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap. The description explicitly mentions the heap, making CWE-122 a more precise fit than its parent CWE-119 or the broader CWE-787. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-122 indicates that it is ALLOWED for heap overflow conditions, solidifying this mapping.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 and is related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The relationship analysis shows that CWE-122 is a specific instance of a more general out-of-bounds write, but the context focuses on the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "heap buffer overflow" in the vulnerability description and reference links, combined with the Variant abstraction level)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also considered because heap overflows are inherently out-of-bounds writes. However, since the description specifically mentions a heap **buffer overflow**, CWE-122 is a more precise classification. CWE-787 is a base level CWE, but CWE-122 gives more specific context to the location of the overflow.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a parent of CWE-122 and describes a general out-of-bounds write. While true, the focus is on a heap buffer, making CWE-122 the better choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Lower confidence because CWE-122 is more specific, although CWE-787 still represents the out-of-bounds write aspect of the vulnerability)
