|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap-buffer overflow**" in OTFCC v0.10.4. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, indicating "Heap buffer overflows occur frequently," and "insufficient bounds checking when handling data." This aligns directly with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which describes a condition where "the product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer." The description and evidence overwhelmingly support this classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE and is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a broader category, the specific mention of a "heap-buffer overflow" warrants the more specific CWE-787.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials).
