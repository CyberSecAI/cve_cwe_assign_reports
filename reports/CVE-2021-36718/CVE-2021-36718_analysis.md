# Analysis for CVE-2021-36718

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the attacker can log in to the system with **default credentials**. This directly aligns with CWE-1392, which describes the "Use of Default Credentials" for potentially critical functionality. The description also highlights that sensitive data (Employee name, Employee ID number, Working hours etc.) can be accessed after logging in. This exposure of sensitive information as an impact of using **default credentials** reinforces the selection of CWE-1392. The retriever results also give CWE-1392 the highest score, thus giving additional support to this choice. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1392 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1392 is a base-level CWE, making it an appropriate level of abstraction. While CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) could be considered, CWE-1392 is more specific to **default credentials**, which is the explicitly stated **root cause**. There are no direct relationships that strongly influence the mapping, but the overall context points towards the use of **default credentials** as the primary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct evidence and retriever score)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions that after logging in with **default credentials**, the attacker can export a report containing sensitive data. This aspect of exporting a report with sensitive data aligns with CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). While the primary issue is the use of **default credentials**, the act of exporting and potentially logging or storing sensitive data represents an additional weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-532 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). Although sensitive information is not necessarily logged to a *file*, exporting a report with sensitive data can be considered a similar action that places the information in a persistent medium. The retriever results also support this choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Moderate confidence because CWE-532 is a resulting impact)
