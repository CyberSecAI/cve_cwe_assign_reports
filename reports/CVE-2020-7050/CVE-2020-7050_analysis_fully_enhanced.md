# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-7050

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1004 | Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **DOM-based XSS** **weakness** exists. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, explicitly mentioning that the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for dynamic content generation, allowing for malicious JavaScript execution. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). The retriever results also rank CWE-79 as the top candidate. CWE-80 is a more specific variant but DOM-based XSS is a general case, making the Base CWE appropriate.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-79 is a base level CWE. The retriever results show relationships such as `CANFOLLOW -> CWE-113` and `PEEROF -> CWE-352`, but these are not relevant to root cause analysis.

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions that session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, which allows attackers to steal authentication cookies. This is a direct instance of CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this **weakness**, noting that the missing `HttpOnly` flag allows JavaScript access to the session cookie. This is a variant-level CWE.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships to analyze for CWE-1004.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference summary, and retriever results for CWE-79)
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. Lower score due to it being a secondary weakness. for CWE-1004)



## Known Examples for CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24045** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24045](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24045): Web application for a room automation system has client-side Javascript that sets a sensitive cookie without the HTTPOnly security attribute, allowing the cookie to be accessed.
- **CVE-2014-3852** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-3852](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-3852): CMS written in Python does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header, allowing remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie.
- **CVE-2015-4138** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-4138](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-4138): Appliance for managing encrypted communications does not use HttpOnly flag.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21494**: MK-AUTH through 19.01 K4.9 allows XSS via the admin/logs_ajax.php tipo parameter. An attacker can leverage this to read the centralmka2 (session token) cookie, which is not set to HTTPOnly.
- **CVE-2021-26589**: A potential security vulnerability has been identified in HPE Superdome Flex Servers. The vulnerability could be remotely exploited to allow Cross Site Scripting (XSS) because the Session Cookie is missing an HttpOnly Attribute. HPE has provided a firmware update to resolve the vulnerability in HPE Superdome Flex Servers.
- **CVE-2020-15776**: An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise 2018.2 - 2020.2.4. The CSRF prevention token is stored in a request cookie that is not annotated as HttpOnly. An attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary code in a user's browser could impose an arbitrary value for this token, allowing them to perform cross-site request forgery.
- **CVE-2020-28482**: This affects the package fastify-csrf before 3.0.0. 1. The generated cookie used insecure defaults, and did not have the httpOnly flag on: cookieOpts: { path: '/', sameSite: true } 2. The CSRF token was available in the GET query parameter
- **CVE-2020-4146**: IBM Security SiteProtector System 3.1.1 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by missing 'HttpOnly' flag. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 174129.
- **CVE-2021-20416**: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.3 and 4.0.0.4 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to set the HTTPOnly flag. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the cookie. IBM X-Force ID: 196218.
- **CVE-2021-20526**: IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the failure to set the HTTPOnly flag. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from the cookie. IBM X-Force ID: 198755.
