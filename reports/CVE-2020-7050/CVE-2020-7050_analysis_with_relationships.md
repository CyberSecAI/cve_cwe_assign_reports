# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-7050 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1004 | Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **DOM-based XSS** **weakness** exists. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, explicitly mentioning that the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for dynamic content generation, allowing for malicious JavaScript execution. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). The retriever results also rank CWE-79 as the top candidate. CWE-80 is a more specific variant but DOM-based XSS is a general case, making the Base CWE appropriate.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-79 is a base level CWE. The retriever results show relationships such as `CANFOLLOW -> CWE-113` and `PEEROF -> CWE-352`, but these are not relevant to root cause analysis.

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions that session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, which allows attackers to steal authentication cookies. This is a direct instance of CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this **weakness**, noting that the missing `HttpOnly` flag allows JavaScript access to the session cookie. This is a variant-level CWE.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships to analyze for CWE-1004.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference summary, and retriever results for CWE-79)
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. Lower score due to it being a secondary weakness. for CWE-1004)
