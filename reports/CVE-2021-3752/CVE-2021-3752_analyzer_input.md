# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3752

## Vulnerability Description
A **use-after-free** flaw was found in the Linux kernels Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a **race condition**. This flaw allows a user to crash the system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **impact:** crash the system and escalate privileges
- **product:** Linux kernels
- **component:** Bluetooth subsystem

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3752:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation of the Linux kernel. This happens because the `chan->data` pointer is not set to `NULL` after the socket is freed, leading to a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The kernel attempts to access memory after it has been freed. Specifically the `chan->data` pointer is used after the underlying `sk` socket object is released.
- Race condition: Multiple threads can potentially try to manipulate the same Bluetooth socket, leading to the use-after-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): A successful exploit can cause memory corruption or a system crash, leading to a DoS.
- Privilege escalation: In some cases, the use-after-free may be exploited to gain elevated privileges.
- Information leak: It's also mentioned that this could potentially lead to sensitive information leaks from the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attacker: A local user on the system with access to the Bluetooth subsystem can trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Bluetooth subsystem.
- Ability to cause specific actions like closing and connecting a bluetooth socket.
- Code execution is needed in order to create and close a bluetooth socket
- Ability to create a specific race condition.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in `net/bluetooth/l2cap_sock.c`
- The fix involves setting `chan->data` to NULL when the socket is destroyed and avoiding killing an already killed socket in `l2cap_sock_close_cb`.
-  The vulnerability exists due to a race condition between multiple threads operating on the same Bluetooth socket leading to the socket object being freed while the channel still holds a pointer to it.
- The fix involves setting the channel's data pointer to NULL when the socket is destroyed.

The provided content from lore.kernel.org includes the patch fixing the use-after-free. This patch sets the `chan->data` pointer to NULL and adds a check to avoid killing a socket that was already killed. This information provides more details than the official CVE description. The Debian Security Advisory and Red Hat bugzilla entry confirms the use-after-free and describes the vulnerability.
