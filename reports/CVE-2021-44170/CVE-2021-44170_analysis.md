## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability" [CWE-121]. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause is a "**stack-based buffer overflow**". This directly matches CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant level CWE and is ALLOWED. The attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands via specially crafted command line arguments.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of the more general CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Since the vulnerability is explicitly a stack-based buffer overflow, CWE-121 is more specific and appropriate than CWE-119.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
