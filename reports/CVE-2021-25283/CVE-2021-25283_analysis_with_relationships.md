| CWE-1336  | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine    | 0.95       | Base                  | Primary                         | Allowed                       |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **server side template injection** in the Jinja renderer. The CVE reference links content summary also confirms that the **root cause** is the Jinja template renderer not properly protecting against **server-side template injection** (SSTI) attacks. This aligns perfectly with CWE-1336, "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine." The description of CWE-1336 states, "The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine." This is precisely what is happening in the described vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found for CWE-1336 in the provided data. However, the nature of template injection often involves improper encoding or escaping, which could potentially relate to CWE-116 if the neutralization failure involves encoding issues. The retriever results listed CWE-116, but given the explicit SSTI, CWE-1336 is the more direct and appropriate mapping.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of server-side template injection and the root cause description)
