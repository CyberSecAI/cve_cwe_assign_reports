# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-3377

## Query
Horner Automations Cscape version 9.90 SP 6 and prior does not properly validate user-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed FNT file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by accessing an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds memory read.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: does not properly validate user-supplied data
- **weakness**: uninitialized pointer
