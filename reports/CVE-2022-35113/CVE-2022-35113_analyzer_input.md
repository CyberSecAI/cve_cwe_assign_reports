- **component:** swf_DefineLosslessBitsTagToImage at /modules/swfbits.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35113. It describes two separate crashes, a heap buffer overflow and a segmentation fault, in `swfrender` when processing specially crafted SWF files. The crashes occur in the `swftools` project.

**Heap buffer overflow:**
- **Root cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `swf_DefineLosslessBitsTagToImage` function when processing a specific SWF file.
- **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Crash/denial of service.
- **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted SWF file processed by `swfrender`.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious SWF file as input to `swfrender`.

**Segmentation fault:**
- **Root cause:** A segmentation fault occurs in the `extractFrame` function when processing a specific SWF file.
- **Vulnerability:** Likely a null pointer dereference or access to invalid memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Crash/denial of service.
- **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted SWF file processed by `swfrender`.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious SWF file as input to `swfrender`.

The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, including the specific functions where the vulnerabilities occur, the crash information (AddressSanitizer output), and the specific files used to reproduce the issues.
