# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-34595

## Vulnerability Description
A crafted request with invalid offsets may cause an out-of-bounds read or write access in CODESYS V2 Runtime Toolkit 32 Bit full and PLCWinNT prior to versions V2.4.7.56, resulting in a denial-of-service condition or local memory overwrite.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** ['out-of-bounds read', 'out-of-bounds write']
- **vector:** crafted request with invalid offsets
- **product:** CODESYS V2 Runtime Toolkit 32 Bit full and PLCWinNT
- **version:** prior to versions V2.4.7.56

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A crafted request with invalid offsets can cause an out-of-bounds read or write access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial-of-service or local memory overwrite.
- **Attack vectors**: Network; a crafted request is sent to the CODESYS Control runtime system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the controller. The request is only processed if no level 1 online password is configured on the controller or if the attacker has previously successfully authenticated to the controller.
