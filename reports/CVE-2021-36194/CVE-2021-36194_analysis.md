|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack-based buffer overflows**" in the API controllers of FortiWeb. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that **stack-based buffer overflows** [CWE-121] are the **weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution, which is a typical impact of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-121 as the second highest match. The description directly matches the CWE definition, and the impact aligns with the expected consequences of the weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of a buffer overflow. It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Buffer overflows can lead to other vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of stack-based buffer overflow in both the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
