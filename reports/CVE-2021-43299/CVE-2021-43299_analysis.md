| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack overflow**" occurs in the PJSUA API's `pjsua_player_create` function because the `filename` argument is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without size validation. This directly matches the definition of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which involves writing beyond the boundaries of a buffer allocated on the stack. The "**attacker** controlled filename argument" further confirms the untrusted source of the oversized data. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary corroborates the stack buffer overflow due to missing size validation. While other CWEs like CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are relevant, CWE-121 is the most specific variant due to the stack allocation context. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates that this mapping is ALLOWED. The CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) highlights the severe impact of this weakness. CWE-787 is also listed by the CVE as weakness/vulnerabilities present, indicating that the overflow leads to out-of-bounds write.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), providing a more specific classification. It can also be viewed as a specific instance of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description, CVE summary, and direct CWE mapping)
