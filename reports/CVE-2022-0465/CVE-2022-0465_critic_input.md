# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Use after free** in Extensions in Google Chrome". The **root cause** is a **use-after-free** condition, which directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via user interaction. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root_cause** as "Use after free in Extensions" and lists "Use after free" as a weakness. This high level of alignment between the description and the characteristics of CWE-416 justifies its selection as the primary CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships provided in the reference material that are relevant to the root cause.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "Use after free", and the CVE reference confirms it.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-825
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672

CanPrecede -> CWE-120

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.
