# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-44828

## Query
Arm Mali GPU Kernel Driver (Midgard r26p0 through r30p0, Bifrost r0p0 through r34p0, and Valhall r19p0 through r34p0) allows a non-privileged user to achieve write access to read-only memory, and possibly obtain root privileges, corrupt memory, and modify the memory of other processes.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: write access to read-only memory
