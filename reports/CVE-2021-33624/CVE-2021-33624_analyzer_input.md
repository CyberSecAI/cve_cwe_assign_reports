# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-33624

## Vulnerability Description
In kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of **type confusion**) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **type confusion**
- **weakness:** **branch misprediction**
- **impact:** read arbitrary memory
- **attacker:** unprivileged BPF program
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** before 5.12.13
- **component:** kernel/bpf/verifier.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33624:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Linux kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) verifier not accurately accounting for speculative execution paths caused by branch mispredictions. The verifier only analyzes valid control-flow paths, ignoring paths that are unreachable in a non-speculative context. However, during speculative execution, mispredicted branches can lead to execution of code paths that the verifier deemed impossible, creating a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Speculative Execution Vulnerability:** The core issue is a flaw in the BPF verifier's handling of speculative execution. It fails to consider paths that become reachable due to branch mispredictions, which allows attackers to bypass the verifier's safety checks and execute code with arbitrary inputs.
*   **Type Confusion:** Mispredicted branches can lead to a "type confusion" where a register holds a value with an incorrect type. This allows an attacker-controlled value to be used as a memory address.
*   **Bypass of Verifier:** The verifier only enumerates valid control-flow paths and skips paths that are unreachable in the non-speculative domain, which can miss issues under speculative execution on mispredicted branches.
* **Missing Memory Access Checks**: The verifier fails to check memory accesses under speculatively executed paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Kernel Memory Read:**  A successful exploit allows an unprivileged BPF program to read arbitrary kernel memory, potentially including all of physical memory. This can expose sensitive data and enable further exploitation.
*   **Information Leakage:** The leaked memory can be extracted via side-channel attacks, such as cache-timing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious BPF program:** Attackers can craft a BPF program that exploits the vulnerability to read arbitrary memory.
*   **Branch Prediction Manipulation:** The attacker needs to train the branch predictor to cause the misprediction required to reach the vulnerable code. This can be done through techniques such as:
    *   Training branches at congruent addresses in user space.
    *   Using specific code sequences to create cache misses and influence branch prediction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to load BPF programs:** The attacker needs to be able to load and execute BPF programs on the target system. This typically requires local access, but could potentially be achieved remotely in certain situations.
*   **Knowledge of Side-Channel Techniques:** To extract the leaked information, attackers need to be able to conduct side-channel attacks.
* **No special privileges**: Unprivileged users can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was independently discovered and reported by multiple researchers: Ofek Kirzner and Adam Morrison, and by Benedict Schlueter and Piotr Krysiuk.
*   The fix involves 'branching off' an unreachable path and marking this branch's vstate as speculative in order to sanitize instructions with jmp-1s, as well as mark registers which have been part of the conditional as unknown in the speculative path.
* The commit fixing the vulnerability is: [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/patch/?id=9183671af6dbf60a1219371d4ed73e23f43b49db](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/patch/?id=9183671af6dbf60a1219371d4ed73e23f43b49db)
