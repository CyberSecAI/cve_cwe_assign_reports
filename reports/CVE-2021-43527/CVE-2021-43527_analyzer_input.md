# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-43527

## Vulnerability Description
NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a **heap overflow** when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely to be impacted. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how they configure NSS. *Note This vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and PDF viewers that use NSS for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and Evince are believed to be impacted. This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS < 3.68.1.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43527:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2021-43527. This is explicitly stated in the text, referencing the CVE ID and describing a vulnerability within the NSS library. Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability including:
*   Mozilla Security Advisory (mfsa2021-51)
*   NetApp Advisory (NTAP-20211229-0002)
*   Siemens Security Advisory (SSA-594438)
*   Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202212-05)
*   StarWind Security Advisory (SW-20220802-0001)
*   Mozilla Bugzilla entry (Bug 1737470)

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `decodeECorDSASignature` function of the NSS library when handling DER-encoded DSA and RSA-PSS signatures. The function fails to properly validate the length of the signature data before copying it to a fixed-size buffer.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness lies in the missing or inadequate input validation of the signature length, leading to the overflow.
    *   **Heap Overflow:** The overflow occurs in a heap-allocated buffer within the `VFYContextStr` structure, potentially corrupting other heap data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** The heap overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite heap memory, potentially redirecting control flow to execute arbitrary code. As demonstrated by Tavis Ormandy in Bugzilla #1737470 comment #4.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can lead to crashes, thereby causing a denial of service.
    *   **Bypass Signature Verification:** The overflow could allow a malicious signature to be accepted as valid, enabling further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Certificates:** Exploiting the vulnerability through crafted certificates that contain large DSA/RSA-PSS signatures. This affects certificate validation, S/MIME, PKCS#7, and PKCS#12.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** In theory, an attacker could inject a malicious signature during the handshake as described by Robert Relyea in Bugzilla #1737470 comment #23 (although Ryan Sleevi explains in comment #24, this is not the case for TLS signatures). 
    *   **S/MIME Email:** Email clients using NSS for S/MIME verification are vulnerable as shown in Bugzilla #1737470 comment #27 where Kai Engert states Thunderbird is affected.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send data to the vulnerable server. This could be through an active MitM attack, or via a vector where the application connects to an untrusted server which provides malicious data.
    *   **Crafted Payloads:** The attacker must create a malicious signature that triggers the overflow, typically through DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.

**3. Specific Product Impacts (from the provided content):**

*   **Mozilla NSS:** Vulnerable versions are those prior to 3.73 and 3.68.1 ESR.
*   **Thunderbird, Evolution, LibreOffice, Evince:** Affected through S/MIME verification as these clients use NSS for signature validation.
*   **NetApp Products:** E-Series SANtricity OS Controller Software 11.x and NetApp Cloud Backup are identified as affected.
*   **Siemens RUGGEDCOM ROX:** Multiple models (MX5000, RX1400, RX1500, RX1501, RX1510, RX1511, RX1512, RX1524, RX1536, RX5000) using versions >= V2.10.0 and < V2.15.0 of RUGGEDCOM ROX devices are affected.
*   **StarWind Products:** SAN&NAS (vSAN) V8 R13 and StarWind VSAN Version V8 (build 14398) are vulnerable.
*   **Oracle Products:** Multiple products are listed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory as vulnerable, using NSS directly or indirectly. These range from Cloud Native Core, E-Business Suite, Fusion Middleware, and others.
*   **Gentoo:** Affected versions of the `dev-libs/nss` package are those below 3.79.2.

**4. Mitigations and Workarounds:**

*   **Update NSS:** The primary mitigation is to update NSS to versions 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR, or any later version containing a fix.
*  **Specific Patches:** For specific products, such as StarWind SAN and NAS to version V8 R13.
*   **IPsec Reconfiguration (Siemens):** Reconfiguring IPsec connections to use a pre-shared key (PSK) is a suggested workaround for RUGGEDCOM devices.
*   **Thunderbird workaround:** An application-specific workaround was implemented in Thunderbird where certificate import was changed to only accept certificates that passed `mozpkix` verification.
*   **Disable DSA:** Since DSA is not used within all supported configurations of applications using NSS, this can serve as a workaround.

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects the processing of DSA and RSA-PSS signatures.
*   Firefox, due to its specific usage of `mozpkix`, is considered not directly vulnerable to remote exploitation in normal use cases, as it does not accept DSA and RSA-PSS certificates. Manual certificate imports may expose users if the certificates have malicious signatures.
*   The vulnerability exists in the NSS library for a long time and is present in code from as early as 2003.
*   The bug could be triggered remotely in Thunderbird, Gnome Evolution, and any other client that processes S/MIME emails and validates DSA certificates.
*   Several vendors made changes in response, which include, patching NSS, or disabling specific code paths that were vulnerable.
*   This bug was found during what was described as novel fuzzing techniques.
*   The root cause is not a logic error, but the missing validation for sizes of data read from DER structures in `decodeECorDSASignature`, causing an out-of-bounds write on the heap.
