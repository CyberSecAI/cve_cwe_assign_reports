### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** unspecified vectors
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** abcm2ps
- **version:** v8.14.11
- **component:** get_key function in parse.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `get_key()` function located in `parse.c`.
*   The root cause lies within the `set_k_acc()` function, where arrays `accs` and `pits` of size 8 are allocated on the stack. If the value of `s->u.key.sf` (presumably representing the number of accidentals in a key signature) is greater than 7, the code attempts to write beyond the bounds of these arrays, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The code does not properly validate the size of `s->u.key.sf` before using it as the upper bound in the `for` loop that writes to `accs` and `pits`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):**  A crafted input file can cause the application to crash due to the stack corruption.
*   **Possible Unspecified Impact:** The vulnerability description and supporting materials note a potential for "unspecified other impact", beyond a simple DoS. This could imply possibilities of further exploitation such as arbitrary code execution, depending on the specifics of the program's behavior and stack layout which would require more investigation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted ABC input file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted ABC (music notation) file to the `abcm2ps` program. This file would need to contain a key signature with a number of accidentals such that `s->u.key.sf` is greater than 7.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input file to be processed by `abcm2ps`. This could involve local file access, remote submission, or even using it within a vulnerable service or application that leverages `abcm2ps`

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The issue #84 on GitHub shows a code snippet of the vulnerable `set_k_acc` function.
*   It also includes a `gdb` session showing the out-of-bounds write and stack corruption.
*   The github issue links a zip file `buffer-over-flow_parse.c_set_k_acc.zip`, presumably containing a proof of concept.
*   A patch is included to avoid the crash when there is an accidental without a note at the start of a line.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `set_k_acc` function of `parse.c` in the abcm2ps program. It occurs when processing a key signature with an excessive number of accidentals, allowing for a denial of service and potentially other unspecified impacts. An attacker needs to supply a crafted input file to trigger it.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `get_key` function of `parse.c`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms that the root cause lies in the `set_k_acc` function, where arrays `accs` and `pits` are allocated on the stack, and an unchecked value of `s->u.key.sf` can cause out-of-bounds writes. This directly matches the characteristics of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The impact is a denial of service (DoS), as the stack corruption leads to a crash. While other CWEs might contribute, CWE-121 is the most specific and accurately reflects the primary weakness. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also related to CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) but more specific since it identifies the stack as the location of the overflow. CWE-121 can lead to other weaknesses like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) or CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The Retriever results show CWE-121 as a strong candidate based on dense and sparse scoring."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit vulnerability description and detailed technical analysis in CVE reference)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The **stack-based buffer overflow** can result in reading data past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to CWE-125 (Buffer Over-read). Although CWE-121 is the primary cause, the potential to read sensitive information due to the overflow makes CWE-125 a relevant secondary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions potential unspecified impact, which could involve reading data beyond the buffer boundaries. The retriever results confirm CWE-125 as a potential candidate"
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and a peer of CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read). It CanFollow CWE-121 as the overflow could lead to out-of-bounds reads. Mapping guidance indicates that CWE-125 is ALLOWED."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence. CWE-125 is a potential consequence of the overflow, but not explicitly stated)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability stems from the code not validating the size of `s->u.key.sf` before using it in a `for` loop, potentially causing an off-by-one error when writing to the `accs` and `pits` arrays. This aligns with CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error), where the calculation or usage of an incorrect maximum or minimum value leads to the overflow. This may be a contributing factor to the buffer overflow. The retriever results also confirm CWE-193 as a potential candidate."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-193 is a base level CWE. It could CanPrecede CWE-119, as the incorrect calculation can lead to memory corruption. Mapping guidance indicates that CWE-193 is ALLOWED."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium confidence. CWE-193 may be the contributing factor but not explicitly stated)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
A buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the "classic" case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.

### Alternative Terms
Classic Buffer Overflow: This term was frequently used by vulnerability researchers during approximately 1995 to 2005 to differentiate buffer copies without length checks (which had been known about for decades) from other emerging weaknesses that still involved invalid accesses of buffers, as vulnerability researchers began to develop advanced exploitation techniques.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions "buffer overflow" - an increasingly vague term. This CWE entry is only appropriate for "Buffer Copy" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no "Checking [the] Size of Input", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.
**Comments:** If the vulnerability being analyzed involves out-of-bounds reads, then consider CWE-125 or descendants. For root cause analysis: if there is any input validation, consider children of CWE-20 such as CWE-1284. If there is a calculation error for buffer sizes, consider CWE-131 or similar.

 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** At the code level, stack-based and heap-based overflows do not differ significantly, so there usually is not a need to distinguish them. From the attacker perspective, they can be quite different, since different techniques are required to exploit them.

**[Terminology]** Many issues that are now called "buffer overflows" are substantively different than the "classic" overflow, including entirely different bug types that rely on overflow exploit techniques, such as integer signedness errors, integer overflows, and format string bugs. This imprecise terminology can make it difficult to determine which variant is being reported.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1094:** buffer overflow using command with long argument
- **CVE-1999-0046:** buffer overflow in local program using long environment variable
- **CVE-2002-1337:** buffer overflow in comment characters, when product increments a counter for a ">" but does not decrement for "<"



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base

## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Implement and perform bounds checking on input.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.



## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When copying character arrays or using character manipulation methods, the correct size parameter must be used to account for the null terminator that needs to be added at the end of the array. Some examples of functions susceptible to this weakness in C include strcpy(), strncpy(), strcat(), strncat(), printf(), sprintf(), scanf() and sscanf().



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
