## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states an **'arbitrary file download and execution'** vulnerability due to **'missing support for integrity check of download URL or downloaded file hash'**. This directly corresponds to CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check), which describes the scenario where a product downloads and executes code from a remote location without sufficiently verifying its origin and integrity. The description also aligns with CWE-353 (Missing Support for Integrity Check), as the root cause is the absence of any mechanism to validate the integrity of the downloaded file."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-494 and CWE-353 are related. CWE-353 describes the general lack of an integrity check, while CWE-494 is more specific, focusing on the download of code. While CWE-494 is more descriptive in this context, CWE-353 highlights the underlying weakness. There are no direct relationships to consider. The retriever results also suggests CWE-427, however the path is not under the control of unintended actors. It is more that the downloaded file is not checked."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (The vulnerability description directly mentions the lack of integrity check during file download and execution, making CWE-494 a strong match). Confidence: 0.7 (CWE-353 is a related weakness, but less specific than CWE-494).

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

### Extended Description


Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as "/tmp" or the current working directory.


In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:


  - the directory from which the program has been loaded

  - the current working directory

In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.

One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.


In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.


In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.


### Alternative Terms
DLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Binary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Insecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Dependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a "substitution attack."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Hard-code the search path to a set of known-safe values (such as system directories), or only allow them to be specified by the administrator in a configuration file. Do not allow these settings to be modified by an external party. Be careful to avoid related weaknesses such as CWE-426 and CWE-428.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When invoking other programs, specify those programs using fully-qualified pathnames. While this is an effective approach, code that uses fully-qualified pathnames might not be portable to other systems that do not use the same pathnames. The portability can be improved by locating the full-qualified paths in a centralized, easily-modifiable location within the source code, and having the code refer to these paths.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Remove or restrict all environment settings before invoking other programs. This includes the PATH environment variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and other settings that identify the location of code libraries, and any application-specific search paths.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).

**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.
- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious "..exe" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH
- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched



## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product downloads source code or an executable from a remote location and executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of the code.

### Extended Description
An attacker can execute malicious code by compromising the host server, performing DNS spoofing, or modifying the code in transit.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-669
ChildOf -> CWE-669
CanFollow -> CWE-79

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Perform proper forward and reverse DNS lookups to detect DNS spoofing.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** 

Encrypt the code with a reliable encryption scheme before transmitting.


This will only be a partial solution, since it will not detect DNS spoofing and it will not prevent your code from being modified on the hosting site.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Speficially, it may be helpful to use tools or frameworks to perform integrity checking on the transmitted code.


  - When providing the code that is to be downloaded, such as for automatic updates of the software, then use cryptographic signatures for the code and modify the download clients to verify the signatures. Ensure that the implementation does not contain CWE-295, CWE-320, CWE-347, and related weaknesses.

  - Use code signing technologies such as Authenticode. See references [REF-454] [REF-455] [REF-456].





### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** This is critical for mobile code, but it is likely to become more and more common as developers continue to adopt automated, network-based product distributions and upgrades. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) might introduce additional subtleties. Common exploitation scenarios may include ad server compromises and bad upgrades.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-9534:** Satellite phone does not validate its firmware image.
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).
- **CVE-2008-3438:** OS does not verify authenticity of its own updates.



## CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a transmission protocol that does not include a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the data during transmission, such as a checksum.

### Extended Description
If integrity check values or "checksums" are omitted from a protocol, there is no way of determining if data has been corrupted in transmission. The lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely implemented. Excluding further sanity checks and input validation performed by applications, the protocol's checksum is the most important level of checksum, since it can be performed more completely than at any previous level and takes into account entire messages, as opposed to single packets.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
PeerOf -> CWE-354

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Add an appropriately sized checksum to the protocol, ensuring that data received may be simply validated before it is parsed and used.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that the checksums present in the protocol design are properly implemented and added to each message before it is sent.
