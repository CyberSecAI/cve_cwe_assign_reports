# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-26608 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-494 | Download of Code Without Integrity Check | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves downloading code without verifying its integrity. |
| CWE-353 | Missing Support for Integrity Check | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This relates to the core issue of missing integrity checks. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states an **'arbitrary file download and execution'** vulnerability due to **'missing support for integrity check of download URL or downloaded file hash'**. This directly corresponds to CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check), which describes the scenario where a product downloads and executes code from a remote location without sufficiently verifying its origin and integrity. The description also aligns with CWE-353 (Missing Support for Integrity Check), as the root cause is the absence of any mechanism to validate the integrity of the downloaded file."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-494 and CWE-353 are related. CWE-353 describes the general lack of an integrity check, while CWE-494 is more specific, focusing on the download of code. While CWE-494 is more descriptive in this context, CWE-353 highlights the underlying weakness. There are no direct relationships to consider. The retriever results also suggests CWE-427, however the path is not under the control of unintended actors. It is more that the downloaded file is not checked."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (The vulnerability description directly mentions the lack of integrity check during file download and execution, making CWE-494 a strong match). Confidence: 0.7 (CWE-353 is a related weakness, but less specific than CWE-494).
