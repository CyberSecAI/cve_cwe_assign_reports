- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Cscape
- **version:** All Versions prior to 9.90 SP5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2021-33015.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files in Horner Automation's Cscape software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The specific vulnerability is an "Access of Uninitialized Pointer" (CWE-824). This occurs due to the software's failure to properly handle user-supplied data within project files, potentially leading to the use of an uninitialized pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves using a specially crafted project file that exploits the vulnerable parsing logic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious project file to a user of the affected software. This is a local attack vector, so the attacker would need to have some form of access to the system to deliver the file. The vulnerability requires user interaction to open the malicious project file.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an **out-of-bounds write** due to an **uninitialized pointer** when parsing project files. The CVE reference summary explicitly identifies the root cause as "Access of **Uninitialized Pointer**" (CWE-824). This aligns perfectly with the CWE-824 description: "The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized." The **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) occurs as a consequence of using this uninitialized pointer, indicating a secondary weakness that is a result of the primary weakness. CWE-824 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred abstraction level according to MITRE mapping guidance.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer) can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The description suggests that the uninitialized pointer is the root cause leading to the memory corruption.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "uninitialized pointer" and "**out-of-bounds write**" in the vulnerability description and CVE summary, matching CWE descriptions precisely.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions an **out-of-bounds write** resulting from the use of an uninitialized pointer, which occurs during the parsing of project files. This aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), where data is written beyond the intended buffer. While the primary weakness is the use of an uninitialized pointer (CWE-824), the **out-of-bounds write** is a significant consequence that contributes to the vulnerability's impact, including potential code execution. This is why CWE-787 is considered a secondary, contributing factor.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE, which makes it a preferred abstraction level. CWE-787 can follow CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer), aligning with the vulnerability description where the uninitialized pointer leads to the **out-of-bounds write**.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence. The vulnerability directly results in memory corruption due to the write operation.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

CanPrecede -> CWE-125

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Memory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
