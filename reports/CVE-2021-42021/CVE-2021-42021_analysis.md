# Analysis for CVE-2021-42021

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-26 | Path Traversal: '/dir/../filename' | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-23 | Relative Path Traversal | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**path traversal vulnerability**" in Siveillance Video DLNA Server. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the **root cause** is a "**path traversal vulnerability**" (CWE-26). The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files outside the application's web document directory. CWE-26 "Path Traversal: '/dir/../filename'" is a Variant of CWE-22, and focuses on '/dir/../filename' sequences. Given the high score in the Retriever Results and explicit mention of path traversal, CWE-26 is the most appropriate primary mapping. CWE-22 is a good secondary candidate as it is the more general form of path traversal and the description does not provide specific path traversal exploitation details. CWE-23 is another secondary candidate because it deals with relative path traversal.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-26 is a variant of CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')). Both CWE-22 and CWE-23 are Base level CWEs. The retriever results and vulnerability description points to path traversal, making CWE-26, CWE-22, and CWE-23 relevant.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "path traversal vulnerability" and high retriever score for CWE-26.)
