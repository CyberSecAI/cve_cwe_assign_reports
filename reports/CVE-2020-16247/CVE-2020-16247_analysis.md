## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that "The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource." This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-668: "The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating that the **root cause** is that "The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource." While CWE-668 is a high-level class, and discouraged, I am selecting it because the description does not provide enough information to select a more specific Base or Variant CWE.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials. Lowered confidence because the description is very general).
