## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack buffer overflow**" and the CVE reference link summary confirms "**Stack buffer overflow in mjs**". CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability. The description specifies that the overflow occurs at a specific memory address (0x7fffe9049390), further supporting the identification of a stack-based overflow. CWE-121 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The Retriever Results lists CWE-121 as a candidate with a score of 0.3388, which supports this selection.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The "stack-based" nature provides sufficient specificity to select CWE-121 over its parent.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of "stack buffer overflow" in vulnerability details and supporting CVE reference)
