# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
In Eclipse Californium version 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0-3.5.0 a **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch** without using a HelloVerifyRequest. Especially, if used with certificate based cipher suites, that results in message amplification (DDoS other peers) and high CPU load (DoS own peer). The misbehavior occurs only with DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD values larger than 0.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2576:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) implementation of Eclipse Californium. Specifically, during session resumption, if a client attempts to resume a session with a different cipher suite than what was initially negotiated, the server incorrectly falls back to a full handshake without performing a stateless cookie exchange using a HelloVerifyRequest. This bypass of the cookie exchange mechanism is the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing HelloVerifyRequest during fallback:** The DTLS server fails to send a `HelloVerifyRequest` when a session resumption attempt triggers a fallback to a full handshake due to a parameter mismatch (e.g., different cipher suite).
*   **Bypass of DoS protection:** The stateless cookie exchange, intended to protect against DoS attacks, is skipped, making the server susceptible to resource exhaustion and amplification attacks.
*   **Incorrect handling of session resumption:** The server does not properly enforce the requirement for the same cipher suite during session resumption.
*  **Missing check of cipher suite**: During session resumption, the server did not check if the cipher suite of the client hello matched the one from the stored session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DoS on the server. By repeatedly sending ClientHello messages with different cipher suites but valid session IDs, the attacker can force the server into expensive full handshakes, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory).
*   **Amplification Attack:** The vulnerability also exposes the server to use as an amplification vector. An attacker can send connection initiation messages with a forged source IP address, causing the server to send large responses (e.g., Certificate messages) to the victim, potentially overwhelming the victim's network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted DTLS handshake messages (ClientHello).
*   **Spoofed IP address:** By using forged source addresses the attacker can perform an amplification attack.
*   **Repeated Session Resumption Attempts:** The attack relies on the server's failure to perform a `HelloVerifyRequest` during a full handshake fallback on session resumption attempts with mismatched parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable DTLS server.
*   **Valid Session IDs:** The attacker must obtain valid session IDs from previous connections to initiate the attack, if `DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD` is enabled.
*   **Ability to Send DTLS Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send DTLS packets (ClientHello) with specific parameters, including a valid session ID and a different cipher suite.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Eclipse Californium versions 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0 to 3.5.0
*   The vulnerability is triggered when  `DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD` is larger than zero. Setting this property to 0 mitigates the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves ensuring the HelloVerifyRequest is always used when falling back to a full handshake.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-408 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification)

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch**, specifically cipher suite mismatch, without using a HelloVerifyRequest. This behavior leads to message amplification and high CPU load, indicative of a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. CWE-408 (Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification) directly aligns with this scenario as it describes a situation where "The product allows an entity to perform a legitimate but expensive operation before authentication or authorization has taken place." In this case, the expensive operation is the full handshake, which is performed before the HelloVerifyRequest can validate the client. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" reinforces this, highlighting the **missing HelloVerifyRequest during fallback** and the **bypass of DoS protection**. This bypass allows attackers to force the server into expensive full handshakes, consuming excessive resources. The Retriever results also strongly support CWE-408, with the highest combined score of 0.9622. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-408 indicates that this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-408 is a base CWE. The description in the Retriever results provides, "The product allows an entity to perform a legitimate but expensive operation before authentication or authorization has taken place." This aligns directly with the vulnerability, so no further relationship analysis is required.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong alignment with vulnerability description, supporting CVE details, and Retriever results.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The excessive CPU load and message amplification resulting from the flawed handshake process suggest a lack of resource management. The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger expensive full handshakes repeatedly, potentially exhausting server resources. While CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a broader category, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is more specific and appropriate. The server allocates resources for the full handshake without proper validation, leading to potential resource exhaustion. While CWE-408 is the primary weakness, the uncontrolled allocation of resources is a significant contributing factor to the vulnerability's impact. The Retriever results also include CWE-770 with a non-negligible score. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-770 indicates that this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-770 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). This relationship indicates that CWE-770 is a more specific instance of the broader resource consumption issue. Given that the vulnerability specifically involves the allocation of resources for handshakes without proper limits or throttling, CWE-770 is a relevant secondary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Secondary weakness, strong alignment with resource consumption aspect of the vulnerability.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

ParentOf -> CWE-405
CanFollow -> CWE-410
ParentOf -> CWE-770
ParentOf -> CWE-771
ParentOf -> CWE-779
ParentOf -> CWE-920

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Mitigation of resource exhaustion attacks requires that the target system either:


  - recognizes the attack and denies that user further access for a given amount of time, or

  - uniformly throttles all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed.

The first of these solutions is an issue in itself though, since it may allow attackers to prevent the use of the system by a particular valid user. If the attacker impersonates the valid user, they may be able to prevent the user from accessing the server in question.

The second solution is simply difficult to effectively institute -- and even when properly done, it does not provide a full solution. It simply makes the attack require more resources on the part of the attacker.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale placed on them.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service
- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of "insufficient" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Clearly specify the minimum and maximum expectations for capabilities, and dictate which behaviors are acceptable when resource allocation reaches limits.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Limit the amount of resources that are accessible to unprivileged users. Set per-user limits for resources. Allow the system administrator to define these limits. Be careful to avoid CWE-410.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place, and it will help the administrator to identify who is committing the abuse. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective.
