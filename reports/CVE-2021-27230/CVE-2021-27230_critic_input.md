# Critic Input for CVE-2021-27230



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
ExpressionEngine before 5.4.2 and 6.x before 6.0.3 allows PHP Code Injection by certain authenticated users who can leverage Translatesave() to write to an _lang.php file under the system/user/language directory.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **PHP code injection**
- **attacker:** certain authenticated users
- **product:** ExpressionEngine
- **version:** before 5.4.2 and 6.x before 6.0.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `ExpressionEngine\Controller\Utilities\Translate::save()` method. User-supplied input from POST parameters is used as keys when constructing a string that will be written to a PHP file. The input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **PHP Code Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of user input before it's used to build a string intended for file writing. Specifically, the keys of the `$_POST` array are not being sanitized before being incorporated into the `$str` variable on line 380. This allows for arbitrary PHP code to be injected.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** While the code attempts to remove `<script>` and `<iframe>` tags, and escapes backslashes and single quotes in the values, this sanitization is insufficient to prevent PHP code injection through the POST keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary PHP code could lead to full system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `Translate::save()` method, with malicious PHP code embedded in the keys of the POST parameters.
*   **File Write:** The vulnerable code uses the `write_file()` function to write the constructed string, including the attacker's injected PHP code, into a `.php` file within the web server's file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs an account with permissions to access the ExpressionEngine Control Panel translation system utilities.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker requires the ability to make HTTP requests to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and how to craft the malicious POST request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in ExpressionEngine versions 6.0.2 and earlier, and 5.4.1 and earlier.
*   The fix involves upgrading to versions 6.0.3 or 5.4.2 or later, where proper sanitization has been implemented.
* The specific file that gets created and written to is within the `/system/user/language/[lang]/[file]_lang.php` path.
* The attacker is able to specify the `[lang]` directory and the `[file]` name using other input parameters.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **PHP code injection** vulnerability in ExpressionEngine. The **root cause** is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing a string that's written to a `_lang.php` file. This aligns perfectly with CWE-96, which describes **Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')**. The attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code, which is then saved into a PHP file, leading to potential execution of that code. Although CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) is a broader category, CWE-96 is more specific because the code is being injected into a static file. CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) is too high-level and doesn't capture the specifics of static code injection."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-96 is a child of CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')). CWE-96 directly addresses the scenario where code is injected into statically saved code, making it a more accurate representation of the vulnerability. This aligns with the principle of choosing the most specific CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to detailed vulnerability description and clear alignment with CWE-96.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability, in effect, allows a malicious actor to create a file with a dangerous type, which is then processed by the system. Although the file isn't being directly uploaded, the end result is the same: a PHP file containing malicious code is created on the server. The 'CVE Reference Links Content Summary' mentions that the constructed string, with injected PHP code, gets written into a '.php' file."
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-434 is related to vulnerabilities involving file handling and execution. While it doesn't have a direct parent-child relationship with CWE-96, the impact of the vulnerability is similar to that of a malicious file upload."
- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.70 (Medium confidence. The vulnerability isn't a direct file upload, but the impact is similar.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) is a potential but less suitable mapping. The code injection in this vulnerability involves failing to neutralize special elements, however, CWE-74 is too generic, and doesn't capture the specifics of code injection in the same way as CWE-96. CWE-74 is also discouraged by MITRE due to its frequent misuse and high level of abstraction."
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-96, but choosing CWE-74 would sacrifice specificity. Given the detailed nature of the vulnerability, a more precise CWE mapping is preferred."
- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.60 (Low confidence. CWE-74 is a general weakness and doesn't accurately represent the specific vulnerability.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Software or other automated logic has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.
**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter control-plane syntax from all input.



### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.
- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.

## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

### Extended Description


When a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.


Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.

ParentOf -> CWE-1336
ParentOf -> CWE-95
ParentOf -> CWE-96
CanFollow -> CWE-98

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of "code execution," which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.
**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Frequent Misinterpretation


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Refactor your program so that you do not have to dynamically generate code.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Run your code in a "jail" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which code can be executed by your product.


Examples include the Unix chroot jail and AppArmor. In general, managed code may provide some protection.


This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of your application may still be subject to compromise.


Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of code injection, use stringent allowlists that limit which constructs are allowed. If you are dynamically constructing code that invokes a function, then verifying that the input is alphanumeric might be insufficient. An attacker might still be able to reference a dangerous function that you did not intend to allow, such as system(), exec(), or exit().





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack.
- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.



## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94
ParentOf -> CWE-97

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:**

However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Output Encoding
- **Description:** Perform proper output validation and escaping to neutralize all code syntax from data written to code files.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "HTML injection" (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0495:** Perl code directly injected into CGI library file from parameters to another CGI program.
- **CVE-2005-1876:** Direct PHP code injection into supporting template file.
- **CVE-2005-1894:** Direct code injection into PHP script that can be accessed by attacker.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Unrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.

### Relationships

PeerOf -> CWE-351
PeerOf -> CWE-436
PeerOf -> CWE-430
CanFollow -> CWE-183
CanFollow -> CWE-184
CanFollow -> CWE-73

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Generate a new, unique filename for an uploaded file instead of using the user-supplied filename, so that no external input is used at all.[REF-422] [REF-423]

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Enforcement by Conversion
- **Description:** When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Consider storing the uploaded files outside of the web document root entirely. Then, use other mechanisms to deliver the files dynamically. [REF-423]



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

This can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).


This can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images
- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores ".shtml" attachments that could contain SSI
- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types
