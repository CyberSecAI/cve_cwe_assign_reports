# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41877

## Vulnerability Description
FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are **missing input length validation** in `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the drive redirection channel - command line options `/drive`, `+drives` or `+home-drive`.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing input length validation**
- **impact:** read out of bound data
- **attacker:** malicious server
- **product:** FreeRDP
- **component:** drive channel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a missing input length validation in the `drive` channel of FreeRDP. Specifically, the `drive_process_irp_query_directory` function lacked a check on the length of the path provided by the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of a validation check on the length of the path received from the server within the `drive` channel.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** This lack of validation allows a malicious server to send a path length that exceeds the actual buffer size allocated to receive the data. When the client attempts to read the path based on the provided length, it can read beyond the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious server can trigger the client to read out-of-bounds data and send it back to the server, potentially revealing sensitive data from the client's memory.
*   **Client Crash:** The attempt to read beyond the allocated memory could lead to a crash of the FreeRDP client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RDP Server:** The attack vector is a malicious RDP server that sends crafted messages to the FreeRDP client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or Compromised RDP Server:** An attacker needs to either control the RDP server that the FreeRDP client connects to or be in a position to intercept and modify traffic between the client and a legitimate server to send the malicious messages.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in FreeRDP versions `<= 2.8.1`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version `2.9.0`.
*   Workaround is to disable the drive redirection channel using command-line options `/drive`, `+drives` or `+home-drive`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by 'Team BT5 (BoB 11th)'.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `6655841cf2a00b764f855040aecb8803cfc5eaba`, which adds a length check to the `drive_process_irp_query_directory` function to prevent the out-of-bounds read.
