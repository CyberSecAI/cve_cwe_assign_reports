- **product:** Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus
- **version:** 6103 and prior

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37421:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly validate the source of the IP address when enforcing access restrictions to the administrative portal. It relies on the `X-Forwarded-For` header, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **IP Address Restriction Bypass:** The application trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` header for IP-based access control, which can be spoofed by attackers.
- **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate the authenticity of the IP address provided in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Admin Portal Access Bypass:** An attacker can bypass IP address restrictions set on the admin portal.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This allows unauthorized access to the administrative interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `X-Forwarded-For` header in HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- **Proxy Tool:** The attacker needs a proxy tool (e.g., Burp Suite) to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- **No prior access is required:** The attacker does not require prior access to the application. They can use this vulnerability directly.

**Summary**
The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass IP restrictions configured for the admin portal by manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header, granting them unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.
