# Summary 
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" occurs due to a "**float rounding results in off-by-one error**". This directly corresponds to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a buffer overflow where the buffer is allocated on the heap. The provided code snippet and the CVE reference summary confirm this. CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) is also relevant as it describes the specific error leading to the overflow. The floating-point rounding leading to `interpolation->upper[i]` potentially being smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]` causing out-of-bounds access is a clear instance of an off-by-one error. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the usage of both CWE-122 and CWE-193.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), making it a more specific choice given the heap allocation detail. CWE-193 can precede CWE-119, indicating it's a contributing factor to the buffer overflow. The integer overflow related CWEs aren't directly related as the problem is with floating points, not integers.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
- **CVE-2020-21602**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
