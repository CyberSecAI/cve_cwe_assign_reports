## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21776.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect calculation of a buffer size when parsing SGI files within the Accusoft ImageGear library. Specifically, the size of a small buffer is calculated based on the `SGI_HDR.xsize` parameter from the SGI header, using the formula `SMALL_BUFFER_SIZE = 2 * SGI_XSIZE + 1`. However, a subsequent `memcpy` operation uses a size argument directly from the file body, without proper bounds checking against the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect buffer size calculation (`CWE-131`).
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking in the `memcpy` operation.
- Use of a size argument from the file body without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds write.
- Potential for code execution as the attacker can partially control the write size and source.
- Crash of the application due to heap corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Providing a specially crafted SGI file to the vulnerable application (Accusoft ImageGear).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious SGI file to the application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Accusoft ImageGear 19.8.
- The `memcpy` size is truncated to a maximum of `0x000004e8`.
- The `SGI_XSIZE` parameter from the SGI header is used to calculate the buffer size.
- The `memcpy` operation uses a size argument from the file body.
- The destination buffer for the `memcpy` is allocated with a size based on the `SGI_XSIZE`.
- The vulnerability can lead to a heap overflow.
