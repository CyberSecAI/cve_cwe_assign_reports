# Critic Input for CVE-2021-21419



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory leak**
- **impact:** memory exhaustion
- **vector:** very large websocket frames
- **attacker:** websocket peer
- **product:** Eventlet
- **version:** prior to 0.31.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of highly compressed data and memory allocation with excessive size values when processing websocket frames in the `eventlet` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data Amplification:** The library doesn't properly limit the size of decompressed data, leading to potential data amplification where a small compressed payload expands to a much larger size in memory.
- **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The library allocates memory based on the size of the incoming data without proper size checks, allowing an attacker to trigger excessive memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious peer can exploit this vulnerability by sending highly compressed websocket frames, causing the Eventlet process to exhaust its memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the websocket protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send websocket frames to a vulnerable Eventlet server. No specific user privileges or interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `eventlet` prior to 0.31.0 (specifically >= 0.10 and < 0.31.0).
- Version 0.31.0 includes a patch that restricts the websocket frame size to reasonable limits.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Compressed Data) and CWE-789 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation).
- Mitigation also includes using OS limits to restrict memory usage, which can help prevent overall machine exhaustion.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.88
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description highlights that a malicious websocket peer can exhaust memory on the Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frames. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions **data amplification** and **unbounded memory allocation** as key weaknesses. The primary weakness aligns strongly with CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data), as the small compressed payload expands to a larger size in memory due to lack of proper size limits. CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a related weakness because the library allocates memory without proper size checks. The mapping guidance for both CWE-409 and CWE-789 indicates that they are ALLOWED. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also considered because resources are allocated without restrictions on size or number, leading to memory exhaustion, though CWE-409 and CWE-789 are more precise.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-409 is a Base level CWE that describes how the product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output. CWE-789 is a Variant level CWE, and a child of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to explicit mention of data amplification and unbounded memory allocation in the CVE reference summary)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Clearly specify the minimum and maximum expectations for capabilities, and dictate which behaviors are acceptable when resource allocation reaches limits.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Limit the amount of resources that are accessible to unprivileged users. Set per-user limits for resources. Allow the system administrator to define these limits. Be careful to avoid CWE-410.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Design throttling mechanisms into the system architecture. The best protection is to limit the amount of resources that an unauthorized user can cause to be expended. A strong authentication and access control model will help prevent such attacks from occurring in the first place, and it will help the administrator to identify who is committing the abuse. The login application should be protected against DoS attacks as much as possible. Limiting the database access, perhaps by caching result sets, can help minimize the resources expended. To further limit the potential for a DoS attack, consider tracking the rate of requests received from users and blocking requests that exceed a defined rate threshold.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.



## CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output.

### Extended Description
An example of data amplification is a "decompression bomb," a small ZIP file that can produce a large amount of data when it is decompressed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-405

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-1955:** XML bomb in web server module
- **CVE-2003-1564:** Parsing library allows XML bomb



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476
CanFollow -> CWE-1284
CanFollow -> CWE-129

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Perform adequate input validation against any value that influences the amount of memory that is allocated. Define an appropriate strategy for handling requests that exceed the limit, and consider supporting a configuration option so that the administrator can extend the amount of memory to be used if necessary.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Operation
- **Description:** Run your program using system-provided resource limits for memory. This might still cause the program to crash or exit, but the impact to the rest of the system will be minimized.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.
