# Analysis for CVE-2022-26474

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 1.00 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.85 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.93
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states an "**out of bounds write** due to an **incorrect calculation of buffer size**". This directly maps to CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size), which is the root cause. The "**incorrect calculation of buffer size**" leads to "**out of bounds write**" (CWE-787). CWE-131 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred abstraction level, and the usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE mapping guidance. CWE-787 is classified as a secondary weakness because it is a consequence of the **incorrect buffer size calculation**.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-131 can lead to CWE-787. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, but using CWE-787 is more specific in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct mention of both the root cause and weakness in the description and CVE reference links)
