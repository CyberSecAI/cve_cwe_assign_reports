  "query": "LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the users configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.3.",
