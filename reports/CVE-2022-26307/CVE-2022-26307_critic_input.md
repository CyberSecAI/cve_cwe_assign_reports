## Vulnerability Description
LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the users configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where **master key was poorly encoded** resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **master key was poorly encoded**
- **impact:** stored passwords vulnerable to brute force attack
- **product:** LibreOffice
- **version:** 7.2 prior to 7.2.7, 7.3 prior to 7.3.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-26307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how LibreOffice (and Apache OpenOffice) encodes the master key used to encrypt stored passwords for web connections. This poor encoding significantly reduces the entropy of the master key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Master Key Encoding:** The primary weakness is the inadequate encoding of the master key, which reduces its effective strength from 128 bits to 43 bits. This makes it significantly easier to crack through brute-force attacks.
*   **Password Storage Vulnerability:**  The stored passwords are encrypted using the weakened master key, making them vulnerable to compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Stored Passwords:** An attacker who gains access to the user's stored configuration data (where passwords are kept) can use brute-force techniques to recover the weakened master key. With the master key compromised, they can decrypt all the stored passwords for web connections.
*   **Access to Web Services:**  Compromised passwords could enable an attacker to access the user's web accounts/services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to User's Configuration Data:** The attacker must first gain access to the user's configuration data, where LibreOffice stores encrypted password information. This could involve malware, physical access to the system, or other methods of data exfiltration.
*  **Brute-Force Attack:** Once the configuration data is obtained, the attacker will attempt to brute force the weak master key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to User's Configuration:** The attacker needs to be able to read the user's configuration files/database where LibreOffice stores encrypted password data.
*   **Computational Resources:** The attacker requires sufficient computing power to perform a brute-force attack on the weakened master key. Although the key is weakened, cracking it still requires some level of resource investment.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects LibreOffice versions prior to 7.2.7 and 7.3.3, and Apache OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13.
*   **Mitigation:** Fixed versions of LibreOffice prompt the user to re-enter their master password to re-encrypt their stored data using the fixed encoding method.
*   **Credit:** OpenSource Security GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Office for Information Security is credited with discovering the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2022-26307 describes a vulnerability where a poorly encoded master key significantly weakens the encryption protecting stored passwords in LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice, allowing an attacker with access to the user's configuration to potentially decrypt their passwords using a brute-force attack.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The primary weakness identified is **insufficient entropy** (CWE-331) in the master key encoding, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **master key was poorly encoded**, resulting in a reduction of its entropy from 128 to 43 bits. This matches the description of CWE-331, where an algorithm produces insufficient entropy, leading to predictable or clustered values."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-331, by itself, doesn't have direct relationships to other cryptographic weaknesses. However, in the context of this vulnerability, the insufficient entropy directly leads to a weakened encryption scheme, which has implications for the confidentiality of stored passwords. The brute force attack is facilitated by the low entropy of the master key, directly exploiting the weakness."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary explicitly mentioning the weakened entropy of the master key).

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a secondary consideration. The passwords are not stored in cleartext, but the encryption is so weak that it is practically equivalent to storing them in a vulnerable manner. The vulnerability description key phrases note that the **master key was poorly encoded** and the **impact** is that the stored passwords are **vulnerable to a brute force attack**. The CVE reference summary confirms that the stored passwords are encrypted using a weakened master key. This aligns with CWE-312's concept of storing sensitive information in a way that is easily accessible due to inadequate protection."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-312 has parent-child relationships with other CWEs related to data storage. While not a direct parent or child, the vulnerability can be seen as related to the broader category of improper data protection. The key aspect is the insufficient protection, making the stored data effectively exposed."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence as the primary weakness is the entropy issue, but the resulting vulnerability exposes stored credentials.)

ChildOf -> CWE-330
ParentOf -> CWE-332
ParentOf -> CWE-333

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Determine the necessary entropy to adequately provide for randomness and predictability. This can be achieved by increasing the number of bits of objects such as keys and seeds.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0950:** Insufficiently random data used to generate session tokens using C rand(). Also, for certificate/key generation, uses a source that does not block when entropy is low.
- **CVE-2008-2108:** Chain: insufficient precision (CWE-1339) in random-number generator causes some zero bits to be reliably generated, reducing the amount of entropy (CWE-331)



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, System Configuration, Operation
- **Description:** When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to encrypt the data at rest. [REF-1297] [REF-1299] [REF-1301]



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
