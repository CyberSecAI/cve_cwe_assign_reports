# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.75 | Pillar | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.65 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-201 | Information Exposure Through Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights a **missing permission check** in `sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast` of `NetworkMonitor.java`. This allows a privileged app to receive WiFi BSSID and SSID without location permissions. This directly relates to **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) because access to sensitive information (WiFi BSSID and SSID) is not correctly restricted, and a **missing authorization** (CWE-862) check is the root cause. This also leads to **Information Exposure** (CWE-201) as the data is transmitted without proper restrictions. However, CWE-284 is a high-level pillar, and CWE-862 is a class level weakness. The root cause is more accurately represented by CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-284 is a Pillar, with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as children. In this case, the **missing permission check** maps directly to CWE-862. CWE-862 is related to CWE-201 (Information Exposure Through Sent Data) as the lack of authorization leads to the transmission of sensitive data. MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-862 with review, which is appropriate since it is a class-level weakness."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (Medium evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, focusing on the **missing permission check**.)

## Known Examples for CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708): Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24226**: In the AccessAlly WordPress plugin before 3.5.7, the file "resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php" responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode is dumping serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.
- **CVE-2021-33687**: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.
- **CVE-2021-3509**: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **CVE-2021-34771**: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.
- **CVE-2021-25122**: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.
- **CVE-2021-0644**: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462
- **CVE-2020-11922**: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
- **CVE-2021-24170**: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.
- **CVE-2021-24585**: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id
