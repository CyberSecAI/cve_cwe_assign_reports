# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-0590 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.75 | Pillar | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.65 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-201 | Information Exposure Through Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights a **missing permission check** in `sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast` of `NetworkMonitor.java`. This allows a privileged app to receive WiFi BSSID and SSID without location permissions. This directly relates to **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) because access to sensitive information (WiFi BSSID and SSID) is not correctly restricted, and a **missing authorization** (CWE-862) check is the root cause. This also leads to **Information Exposure** (CWE-201) as the data is transmitted without proper restrictions. However, CWE-284 is a high-level pillar, and CWE-862 is a class level weakness. The root cause is more accurately represented by CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-284 is a Pillar, with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as children. In this case, the **missing permission check** maps directly to CWE-862. CWE-862 is related to CWE-201 (Information Exposure Through Sent Data) as the lack of authorization leads to the transmission of sensitive data. MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-862 with review, which is appropriate since it is a class-level weakness."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (Medium evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, focusing on the **missing permission check**.)
