# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-29496

## Vulnerability Description
A **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in the BlynkConsole.h runCommand functionality of Blynk -Library v1.0.1. A specially-crafted network request can lead to command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** command execution
- **vector:** specially-crafted network request
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Blynk -Library
- **version:** v1.0.1
- **component:** runCommand functionality of BlynkConsole.h

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2022-29496.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `split_argv` function within the `runCommand` function in Blynk-Library does not validate the size of the input command against the size of the `argv` buffer allocated on the stack. This allows for a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `split_argv` function.
- Lack of bounds checking when splitting the command string into arguments, allowing the `argv` array to be overflowed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Overwriting the return address of the `runCommand` function.
- Arbitrary command execution by redirecting execution flow to attacker controlled data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted network request to the device containing a command with more arguments than the `argv` buffer can hold.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the device running the vulnerable Blynk-Library.
- No special privileges are needed.
