Specially-crafted configuration values can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker can modify a configuration value and then execute an XCMD to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from format string injection via the `default_key_id` and `key` configuration parameters, as used within the `testWifiAP` XCMD handler",
