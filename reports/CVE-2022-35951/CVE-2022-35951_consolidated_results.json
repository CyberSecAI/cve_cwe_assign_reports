  "query": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.",
