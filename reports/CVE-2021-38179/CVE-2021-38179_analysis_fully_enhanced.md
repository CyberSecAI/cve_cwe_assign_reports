# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-489 | Active Debug Code | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-497 | Information Leak Through System Calls | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The **rootcause** of this vulnerability is "**Debug function enabled by default**" which allows an Admin User to see captured packet contents including user credentials. This aligns well with CWE-489 (Active Debug Code). The description of CWE-489 states that "The product is deployed to unauthorized actors with debugging code still enabled or active, which can create unintended entry points or **expose sensitive information**." The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the exposure of user credentials. This aligns well with CWE-489's description.
  CWE-497 (Information Leak Through System Calls) is also a possibility, since the debugging functionality allows access to sensitive system-level information.
  CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) could be considered if the packets are transmitted in cleartext. But since the **rootcause** is enabling **debug function**, it is less relevant.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships shown for CWE-489, CWE-497, and CWE-319.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence aligns well with the weakness details. The description explicitly indicates that sensitive information is exposed due to debugging features being enabled by default)

## Known Examples for CWE-489: Active Debug Code
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-38179**: Debug function of Admin UI of SAP Business One Integration is enabled by default. This allows Admin User to see the captured packet contents which may include User credentials.
- **CVE-2021-23861**: By executing a special command, an user with administrative rights can get access to extended debug functionality on the VRM allowing an impact on integrity or availability of the installed software. This issue also affects installations of the DIVAR IP and BVMS with VRM installed.
- **CVE-2022-20089**: In aee driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to active debug code. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06240397; Issue ID: ALPS06240397.
- **CVE-2022-33323**: Active Debug Code vulnerability in robot controller of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation industrial robot MELFA SD/SQ Series and MELFA F-Series allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access by authentication bypass through an unauthorized telnet login. As for the affected model names, controller types and firmware versions, see the Mitsubishi Electric's advisory which is listed in [References] section.
- **CVE-2021-28112**: Draeger X-Dock Firmware before 03.00.13 has Active Debug Code on a debug port, leading to remote code execution by an authenticated attacker.
- **CVE-2022-36348**: Active debug code in some Intel (R) SPS firmware before version SPS_E5_04.04.04.300.0 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.
- **CVE-2022-24797**: Pomerium is an identity-aware access proxy. In distributed service mode, Pomerium's Authenticate service exposes pprof debug and prometheus metrics handlers to untrusted traffic. This can leak potentially sensitive environmental information or lead to limited denial of service conditions. This issue is patched in version v0.17.1 Workarounds: Block access to `/debug` and `/metrics` paths on the authenticate service. This can be done with any L7 proxy, including Pomerium's own proxy service.


## Known Examples for CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-32638** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32638](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32638): Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0291**: An Exposure of System Data vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, where a sensitive system-level resource is not being sufficiently protected, allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to send specific traffic which partially reaches this resource. A high rate of specific traffic may lead to a partial Denial of Service (DoS) as the CPU utilization of the RE is significantly increased. The SNMP Agent Extensibility (agentx) process should only be listening to TCP port 705 on the internal routing instance. External connections destined to port 705 should not be allowed. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.3R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 13.2R1.
- **CVE-2021-26067**: Affected versions of Atlassian Bamboo allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace that may reveal the path for the home directory in disk and if certain files exists on the tmp directory, via a Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability in the /chart endpoint. The affected versions are before version 7.2.2.
