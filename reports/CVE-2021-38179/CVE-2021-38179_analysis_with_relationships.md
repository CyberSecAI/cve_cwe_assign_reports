# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-489 | Active Debug Code | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-497 | Information Leak Through System Calls | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The **rootcause** of this vulnerability is "**Debug function enabled by default**" which allows an Admin User to see captured packet contents including user credentials. This aligns well with CWE-489 (Active Debug Code). The description of CWE-489 states that "The product is deployed to unauthorized actors with debugging code still enabled or active, which can create unintended entry points or **expose sensitive information**." The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the exposure of user credentials. This aligns well with CWE-489's description.
  CWE-497 (Information Leak Through System Calls) is also a possibility, since the debugging functionality allows access to sensitive system-level information.
  CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) could be considered if the packets are transmitted in cleartext. But since the **rootcause** is enabling **debug function**, it is less relevant.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships shown for CWE-489, CWE-497, and CWE-319.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence aligns well with the weakness details. The description explicitly indicates that sensitive information is exposed due to debugging features being enabled by default)
