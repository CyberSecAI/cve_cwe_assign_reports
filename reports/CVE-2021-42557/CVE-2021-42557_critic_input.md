### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **bug**
- **impact:** bypass API access and retrieve users credentials
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Jeedom
- **version:** through 4.1.19

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type juggling issue in the `jeedom::apiAccess` function within the Jeedom home automation software. The function uses a loose comparison (`==`) instead of a strict comparison (`===`) when verifying API keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Juggling:** The use of `==` allows for type coercion, meaning an integer `0` can be loosely equal to a string API key.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By providing an integer `0` as the API key, an attacker can bypass the authentication check within the `jeedom::apiAccess` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized API Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to the Jeedom API.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker can use the API to retrieve sensitive information, including user credentials such as usernames and passwords (including http and ssh credentials).
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Through the API and the web interface, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/core/api/proApi.php` or `/core/api/jeeApi.php` endpoints.
*   **API Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `apikey`, `api`, or `proapi` parameters in the POST request by setting them to the integer `0`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Jeedom server.
*   **No Prior Credentials:** The attacker does not need a valid API key to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability affects Jeedom versions 4.1.26 and below, and is fixed in version 4.1.27.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Synacktiv.
*   The report notes that thousands of Jeedom applications are exposed on the internet according to shodan.io and fofa.so, increasing the potential attack surface.
*   The advisory recommends using the strict comparison operator (`===`) to prevent the type juggling issue.

**Summary:** This is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to completely bypass authentication and gain control of a Jeedom system. The combination of API access and command execution makes it a high-severity issue.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description indicates that a **bug** allows a remote attacker to bypass API access and retrieve user credentials in Jeedom through 4.1.19. The CVE reference summary highlights the root cause as a **type juggling issue** due to the use of a loose comparison (`==`) instead of a strict comparison (`===`) in the `jeedom::apiAccess` function. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication by providing an integer `0` as the API key, leading to unauthorized API access and the retrieval of sensitive information, including user credentials. The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication for a critical function, aligning with CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The use of a loose comparison operator in string comparison, is also a contributing factor, aligning with CWE-597."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-306 is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the absence of authentication. CWE-597 is a variant that explains the specific type of **bug**, namely, a loose comparison operator, which is the root cause of the authentication bypass.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses the wrong operator when comparing a string, such as using "==" when the .equals() method should be used instead.

### Extended Description
In Java, using == or != to compare two strings for equality actually compares two objects for equality rather than their string values for equality. Chances are good that the two references will never be equal. While this weakness often only affects program correctness, if the equality is used for a security decision, the unintended comparison result could be leveraged to affect program security.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-595
ChildOf -> CWE-595
ChildOf -> CWE-480

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** Within Java, use .equals() to compare string values.
 Within JavaScript, use == to compare string values.
 Within PHP, use == to compare a numeric value to a string value. (PHP converts the string to a number.)






## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.

## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ParentOf -> CWE-288

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.
