# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-597 | Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison | 0.7 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description indicates that a **bug** allows a remote attacker to bypass API access and retrieve user credentials in Jeedom through 4.1.19. The CVE reference summary highlights the root cause as a **type juggling issue** due to the use of a loose comparison (`==`) instead of a strict comparison (`===`) in the `jeedom::apiAccess` function. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication by providing an integer `0` as the API key, leading to unauthorized API access and the retrieval of sensitive information, including user credentials. The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication for a critical function, aligning with CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The use of a loose comparison operator in string comparison, is also a contributing factor, aligning with CWE-597."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-306 is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the absence of authentication. CWE-597 is a variant that explains the specific type of **bug**, namely, a loose comparison operator, which is the root cause of the authentication bypass. CWE-200 is a Class that highlights the impact of the vulnerability. The attacker can retrieve users credentials."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials supporting CWE-306)
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Supporting evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials supporting CWE-597)
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Supporting evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials supporting CWE-200)
