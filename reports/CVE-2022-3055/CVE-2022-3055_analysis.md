*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

This aligns directly with the description of CWE-416, which is "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed." The reference links summary further confirms the root cause as "Use-after-free in the Passwords component of Chromium." The weakness results in "**heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page," as noted in the description. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, providing sufficient specificity for this vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-416 is a child of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry), directly mapping to CWE-416 is more precise given the explicit mention of "use after free" in the vulnerability description. The relationships of CWE-416 show that it CanFollow weaknesses like CWE-364 (Signal Handler Race Condition) and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), but these are not directly relevant to this specific case.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit statement of "use after free" aligns perfectly with CWE-416.)
