# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-2991

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states a heap-based buffer overflow. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data.|

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states that it is a **heap-based buffer overflow** due to the **lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data**. This aligns directly with CWE-122, which is a **heap-based buffer overflow**. Additionally, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is included as a secondary weakness because the root cause is the **lack of validation of the length of the input data** before copying it into the buffer. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data** as the root cause."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-1284 describes the root cause leading to the buffer overflow. CWE-1284 is related to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), but CWE-1284 is more specific as it relates to the validation of quantities like size or length."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence of heap-based buffer overflow and lack of input validation).

## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-11176**: While processing server certificate from IPSec server, certificate validation for subject alternative name API can cause heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
