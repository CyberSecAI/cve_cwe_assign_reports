# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-11256

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-822 | Untrusted Pointer Dereference | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.6
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions "**Memory corruption** due to lack of check of validation of pointer to buffer passed to trustzone". This suggests that a pointer is being used without proper validation, which could lead to it pointing to an unexpected memory location. CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) describes a scenario where "The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer." This aligns well with the provided description, since the pointer to buffer is passed to trustzone, and if the pointer is not validated, then trustzone will dereference an untrusted pointer, leading to memory corruption. The retriever results also list CWE-822 as the top candidate. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a possibility given the "**Memory corruption**" description, where memory outside the intended buffer is written to, which causes memory corruption.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-822 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for mapping root causes. It is related to pointer dereferences. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating that it is a more specific form of buffer-related weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Due to the clear indication of pointer validation issues)

## Known Examples for CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-5655** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5655](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5655): message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.
- **CVE-2010-2299** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2299](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2299): labeled as a "type confusion" issue, also referred to as a "stale pointer." However, the bug ID says "contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly". The "handle" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).
- **CVE-2009-1719** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1719](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1719): Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.
- **CVE-2009-1250** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1250](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1250): An error code is incorrectly checked and interpreted as a pointer, leading to a crash.
- **CVE-2009-0311** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0311](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0311): An untrusted value is obtained from a packet and directly called as a function pointer, leading to code execution.
- **CVE-2010-1818** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1818](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1818): Undocumented attribute in multimedia software allows "unmarshaling" of an untrusted pointer.
- **CVE-2010-3189** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3189](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3189): ActiveX control for security software accepts a parameter that is assumed to be an initialized pointer.
- **CVE-2010-1253** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1253): Spreadsheet software treats certain record values that lead to "user-controlled pointer" (might be untrusted offset, not untrusted pointer).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-22649**: Luxion KeyShot versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Viewer versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Network Rendering versions prior to 10.1, and Luxion KeyVR versions prior to 10.1 have multiple NULL pointer dereference issues while processing project files, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **CVE-2021-40157**: A user may be tricked into opening a malicious FBX file which may exploit an Untrusted Pointer Dereference vulnerability in FBXâ€™s Review version 1.5.0 and prior causing it to run arbitrary code on the system.
