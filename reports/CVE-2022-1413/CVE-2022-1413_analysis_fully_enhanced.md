## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a missing input masking issue leading to the disclosure of potentially sensitive integration properties in the web interface of GitLab. This directly corresponds to CWE-549, Missing Password Field Masking, as it describes a scenario where sensitive information is not properly masked during input or display, leading to potential exposure. The description states that "potentially sensitive integration properties to be disclosed in the web interface," which aligns with the core concept of CWE-549. The CVE reference link provides a commit log, but does not contain any vulnerability details, but the explicit phrasing in the description is strong supporting evidence. The retriever identified CWE-549 as the top candidate with a score of 0.7124, further supporting this mapping. The usage of CWE-549 is "Allowed" according to MITRE, making it appropriate for this scenario.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-549 does not have direct parent-child relationships listed in the provided information, it can be related to broader information exposure issues. If the sensitive information were logged, CWE-532 could also apply, or if the information was sent, CWE-201 might also apply.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and retriever results)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is considered as a secondary candidate. The vulnerability description focuses on the disclosure of sensitive properties in the web interface. However, it's possible that these properties are also being logged, which would make CWE-532 relevant. Without further information on whether logging is involved, this remains a potential but unconfirmed weakness. The retriever score of 0.3955 is moderate, indicating some relevance. The usage is "Allowed", but the evidence is weak.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-532 is related to information disclosure vulnerabilities. If the information is logged, CWE-532 could be a contributing factor to the overall vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Moderate confidence as logging is only a potential factor)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered as a secondary candidate. The vulnerability description focuses on the disclosure of sensitive properties in the web interface. There may be a scenario where the information is being sent somewhere, which would make CWE-201 relevant. Without further information on whether the information is sent, this remains a potential but unconfirmed weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-201 is related to information disclosure vulnerabilities. If the information is sent, CWE-201 could be a contributing factor to the overall vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Moderate confidence as sending is only a potential factor)



## Known Examples for CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2022-1413**: Missing input masking in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 1.0.2 before 14.8.6, all versions from 14.9.0 before 14.9.4, and all versions from 14.10.0 before 14.10.1 causes potentially sensitive integration properties to be disclosed in the web interface
- **CVE-2022-38663**: Jenkins Git Plugin 4.11.4 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding.
- **CVE-2022-1342**: A lack of password masking in Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager allows physically proximate attackers to observe sensitive data. A caching issue can cause sensitive fields to sometimes stay revealed when closing and reopening a panel, which could lead to involuntarily disclosing sensitive information. This issue affects: Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager 2022.1.24 version and prior versions.
- **CVE-2022-20914**: A vulnerability in the External RESTful Services (ERS) API of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a specific REST API output. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, including administrative credentials for an external authentication server. Note: To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid ERS administrative credentials.
- **CVE-2022-22550**: Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 8.2.2 and above, contain a password disclosure vulnerability. An unprivileged local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to account take over.
- **CVE-2022-23109**: Jenkins HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not mask Vault credentials in Pipeline build logs or in Pipeline step descriptions when Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.85 or later is installed.


## Known Examples for CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708): Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24226**: In the AccessAlly WordPress plugin before 3.5.7, the file "resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php" responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode is dumping serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.
- **CVE-2021-33687**: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.
- **CVE-2021-3509**: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
