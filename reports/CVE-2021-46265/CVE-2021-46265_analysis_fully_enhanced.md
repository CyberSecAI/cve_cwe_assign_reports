# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**stack buffer overflow**" in the `wanBasicCfg` module of the Tenda AC Series Router. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant level CWE that specifically describes this type of buffer overflow. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via crafted overflow data. The term "**stack buffer overflow**" aligns precisely with the definition of CWE-121. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section lists CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary match, however, since the description explicitly says "stack buffer overflow", CWE-121 is a more specific and appropriate choice. The retriever also lists CWE-121 as a candidate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but it provides a more specific classification by identifying the buffer's location on the stack. CWE-121 is also related to other buffer overflow variants.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description)
