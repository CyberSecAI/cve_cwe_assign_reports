# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a stack overflow, aligning with the characteristics of CWE-121. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**stack overflow** via the function formGetPassengerAnalyseData". CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability, where a buffer allocated on the stack is overwritten. The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-121 as a relevant CWE with a high score, supporting this mapping. The evidence points specifically to a stack-based buffer overflow, making CWE-121 a precise and appropriate classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED, making it suitable for this vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent weakness, CWE-121 provides more specificity by identifying the location of the buffer as the stack. This more detailed identification makes CWE-121 the preferred choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "stack overflow" in the vulnerability description)
