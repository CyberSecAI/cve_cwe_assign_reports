# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21901

## Vulnerability Description
A **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in the CMA check_udp_crc function of Garrett Metal Detectors iC Module CMA Version 5.0. A specially-crafted packet can lead to a **stack-based buffer overflow** during a call to memcpy. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **vector:** specially-crafted packet
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Garrett Metal Detectors iC Module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `check_udp_crc` function due to a size mismatch when copying the UDP payload. The `udp_thread` function receives a maximum of 512 bytes into a buffer, but the `check_udp_crc` function allocates only 256 bytes for its internal copy of the payload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Classic buffer overflow (CWE-120). The `memcpy` in `check_udp_crc` doesn't check the size of the input before copying data from the larger buffer in `udp_thread` to the smaller buffer in `check_udp_crc`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack during the buffer overflow. This is evidenced by the crash information showing the program counter (`$pc`) pointing to garbage data ('LMMM') after the overflow.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the vulnerable device on port 6877.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. No authentication is required.
