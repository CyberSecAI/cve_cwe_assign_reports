  "query": "A signal handler race condition exists in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS due to the absence of a specific protection mechanism to avoid a race condition which may allow an attacker to bypass the storm-control feature on devices. This issue is a corner case and only occurs during specific actions taken by an administrator of a device under certain specifics actions which triggers the event. The event occurs less frequently on devices which are not configured with Virtual Chassis configurations, and more frequently on devices configured in Virtual Chassis configurations. This issue is not specific to any particular Junos OS platform. An Indicator of Compromise (IoC) may be seen by reviewing log files for the following error message seen by executing the following show statement show log messages | grep storm Result to look for /kernel GENCFG op 58 (Storm Control Blob) failed err 1 (Unknown) This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D49 on EX Series 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S6 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D191, 15.1X49-D200 on SRX Series 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S7 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S11, 16.2R3 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S11, 17.1R3 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R2-S8, 17.2R3-S3 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S5, 17.3R3-S7 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S5 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S6, 18.2R3 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S7, 18.3R2-S3, 18.3R3 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S5, 18.4R2 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S4, 19.1R2.",
