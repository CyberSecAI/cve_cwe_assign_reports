# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-35508

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-364 | Signal Handler Race Condition | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | 0.65 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **race condition** and **incorrect initialization of the process id** in the Linux kernel's signal handler filtering, which directly aligns with CWE-364 (Signal Handler Race Condition) and CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource). The attack allows a local attacker to bypass checks and send signals to privileged processes. The **race condition** in signal handling during process cloning (specifically with the `CLONE_PARENT` flag) makes CWE-364 a strong candidate. The issue regarding the **incorrect initialization of the process ID** strongly suggests CWE-909.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-364 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. It is related to concurrency issues. CWE-909 is a Class level CWE, and might have more specific children, but the description fits here given the provided context.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results)
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium evidence, due to the abstraction level being Class)

## Known Examples for CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-20739** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-20739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-20739): A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage
- **CVE-2005-1036** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1036](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1036): Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-23994**: A WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough, resulting in memory corruption and an out of bound write. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.
- **CVE-2021-31919**: An issue was discovered in the rkyv crate before 0.6.0 for Rust. When an archive is created via serialization, the archive content may contain uninitialized values of certain parts of a struct.
- **CVE-2021-29647**: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a partially uninitialized data structure, aka CID-50535249f624.
- **CVE-2021-28687**: HVM soft-reset crashes toolstack libxl requires all data structures passed across its public interface to be initialized before use and disposed of afterwards by calling a specific set of functions. Many internal data structures also require this initialize / dispose discipline, but not all of them. When the "soft reset" feature was implemented, the libxl__domain_suspend_state structure didn't require any initialization or disposal. At some point later, an initialization function was introduced for the structure; but the "soft reset" path wasn't refactored to call the initialization function. When a guest nwo initiates a "soft reboot", uninitialized data structure leads to an assert() when later code finds the structure in an unexpected state. The effect of this is to crash the process monitoring the guest. How this affects the system depends on the structure of the toolstack. For xl, this will have no security-relevant effect: every VM has its own independent monitoring process, which contains no state. The domain in question will hang in a crashed state, but can be destroyed by `xl destroy` just like any other non-cooperating domain. For daemon-based toolstacks linked against libxl, such as libvirt, this will crash the toolstack, losing the state of any in-progress operations (localized DoS), and preventing further administrator operations unless the daemon is configured to restart automatically (system-wide DoS). If crashes "leak" resources, then repeated crashes could use up resources, also causing a system-wide DoS.
- **CVE-2021-23386**: This affects the package dns-packet before 5.2.2. It creates buffers with allocUnsafe and does not always fill them before forming network packets. This can expose internal application memory over unencrypted network when querying crafted invalid domain names.
- **CVE-2021-26333**: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) chipset driver. The discretionary access control list (DACL) may allow low privileged users to open a handle and send requests to the driver resulting in a potential data leak from uninitialized physical pages.
- **CVE-2021-36386**: report_vbuild in report.c in Fetchmail before 6.4.20 sometimes omits initialization of the vsnprintf va_list argument, which might allow mail servers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via long error messages. NOTE: it is unclear whether use of Fetchmail on any realistic platform results in an impact beyond an inconvenience to the client user.
- **CVE-2020-25579**: In FreeBSD 12.2-STABLE before r368969, 11.4-STABLE before r369047, 12.2-RELEASE before p3, 12.1-RELEASE before p13 and 11.4-RELEASE before p7 msdosfs(5) was failing to zero-fill a pair of padding fields in the dirent structure, resulting in a leak of three uninitialized bytes.
