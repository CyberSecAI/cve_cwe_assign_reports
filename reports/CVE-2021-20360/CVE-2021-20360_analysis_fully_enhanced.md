# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                  | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm          | 0.85       | Class                 | Allowed-with-Review             | Primary CWE                    |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information          | 0.70       | Base                  | Allowed                         | Secondary Candidate             |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the use of **"weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms"**, which directly aligns with CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates the **root cause** is "**Insecure HTTP communications are used** within IBM Cloud Pak for Applications v4.3". While CWE-327 is a Class-level CWE, it serves as an appropriate initial classification due to the high-level nature of the description. More detailed analysis would be needed to determine if a more specific Base or Variant CWE is applicable. Additionally, the use of insecure HTTP directly relates to transmitting sensitive information in cleartext, which is covered by CWE-319.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-327 is a Class-level CWE. The Retriever Results suggests children like CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) and CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort), but the description doesn't give any information about the type of crypto algorithms used. CWE-319 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Due to the explicit mention of weak crypto and good match to CWE-327 description)
  - Confidence: 0.70 (For CWE-319 since the **root cause** is insecure communication over HTTP)

## Known Examples for CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30273](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30273): SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30320](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30320): Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3775](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3775): Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.
- **CVE-2007-4150** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4150](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4150): product only uses "XOR" to obfuscate sensitive data
- **CVE-2007-5460** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5460](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5460): product only uses "XOR" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data
- **CVE-2005-4860** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4860](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4860): Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.
- **CVE-2002-2058** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-2058](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-2058): Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.
- **CVE-2008-3188** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3188](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3188): Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.
- **CVE-2005-2946** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2946](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2946): Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.
- **CVE-2007-6013** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-6013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-6013): Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.
