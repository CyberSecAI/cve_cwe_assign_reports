# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-20360 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                  | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm          | 0.85       | Class                 | Allowed-with-Review             | Primary CWE                    |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information          | 0.70       | Base                  | Allowed                         | Secondary Candidate             |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the use of **"weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms"**, which directly aligns with CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates the **root cause** is "**Insecure HTTP communications are used** within IBM Cloud Pak for Applications v4.3". While CWE-327 is a Class-level CWE, it serves as an appropriate initial classification due to the high-level nature of the description. More detailed analysis would be needed to determine if a more specific Base or Variant CWE is applicable. Additionally, the use of insecure HTTP directly relates to transmitting sensitive information in cleartext, which is covered by CWE-319.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-327 is a Class-level CWE. The Retriever Results suggests children like CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) and CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort), but the description doesn't give any information about the type of crypto algorithms used. CWE-319 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Due to the explicit mention of weak crypto and good match to CWE-327 description)
  - Confidence: 0.70 (For CWE-319 since the **root cause** is insecure communication over HTTP)
