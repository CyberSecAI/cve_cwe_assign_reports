# Analysis for CVE-2022-29642

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** vulnerability in the `setUrlFilterRules` function due to the `url` parameter. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the `strcpy` function copies the user-supplied `url` parameter into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without bounds checking, leading to a **stack buffer overflow**. This directly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), a Variant-level CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-121 with a high score. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a more general case of this vulnerability. However, the provided description is more specific to the stack, so CWE-121 is a better fit. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates that this is ALLOWED.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 is a parent of CWE-121, being a more general case of an out-of-bounds write.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials).
