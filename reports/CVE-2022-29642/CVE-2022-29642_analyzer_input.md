# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-29642

## Vulnerability Description
TOTOLINK A3100R V4.1.2cu.5050_B20200504 and V4.1.2cu.5247_B20211129 were discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the url parameter in the function setUrlFilterRules. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted POST request.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `setUrlFilterRules` function in the `firewall.so` module does not properly validate the length of the "url" parameter received in a POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the user-supplied "url" parameter into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without any bounds checking. If the provided "url" exceeds the buffer's capacity, it results in a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As mentioned in the analysis, a successful overflow can lead to a denial of service. By overwriting the stack, the attacker can crash the application/device.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution:** While the provided content mentions DoS specifically, the vulnerability could potentially be used to achieve remote code execution if the attacker crafts a specific overflow payload to overwrite the return address on the stack, though this is not explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.
- **"url" Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is "url" within the POST data.
- **Topicurl:** The `topicurl` is `"setting/setUrlFilterRules"`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device. This implies:
  - Network Access: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device, or have a way to reach the device over the network.
  - Knowledge of the target API endpoint and vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The content specifically names vulnerable firmware versions for the TOTOLINK A3100R router
- A proof-of-concept (POC) HTTP request is provided, showing how to trigger the vulnerability using an overly long "url" value.

This content provides more specific details about the vulnerability, affected software versions, and a functional PoC than the placeholder CVE description.
