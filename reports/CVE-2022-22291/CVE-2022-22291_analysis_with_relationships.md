# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                               | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.85       | Base                  | Allowed                         |                               |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Logging of excessive data**" leading to a privileged attacker being able to get "Cell Location Information". This directly aligns with CWE-532 "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", which is a Base level CWE and therefore preferred. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also confirms the **rootcause** as "Logging of excessive data vulnerability in telephony" and the **weakness** as "Logging of excessive data." The impact is that "Privileged attackers can get Cell Location Information through log of user device."
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-532 is related to information exposure, which is a child of CWE-200, but this vulnerability is not just information exposure, but specifically logging of sensitive information.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to explicit mention of logging sensitive information in the vulnerability description and confirmation in CVE reference links)
