# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1523

## Vulnerability Description
Fuji Electric D300win prior to version 3.7.1.17 is vulnerable to a **write-what-where condition**, which could allow an attacker to overwrite program memory to manipulate the flow of information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **write-what-where condition**
- **impact:** manipulate the flow of information
- **vector:** overwrite program memory
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Fuji Electric D300win
- **version:** prior to version 3.7.1.17

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a "write-what-where" condition in the Fuji Electric D300win software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition):** The software allows an attacker to write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to overwrite program memory and manipulate the flow of information. This could potentially lead to:
    - **Manipulation of information:** Attackers could alter data processed by the software.
    - **Control of program flow:** Attackers could redirect the execution of the program by overwriting memory containing program instructions or control data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit, meaning an attacker does not need to overcome many obstacles to perform the exploit.
- **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** User interaction is required for successful exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable software.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into performing an action (likely opening a malicious file) that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The affected software is Fuji Electric's D300win programming support tool for industrial control systems.
- The vulnerability affects versions prior to 3.7.1.17.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1.
- The CVSS vector string is `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N`.

This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by specifying the affected product, the nature of the vulnerability (write-what-where), the potential impact, and the attack vector, along with specific CVSS v3 score and vector string.
