| CWE-694 | Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier                     | 0.95       | Base                    | Primary                         | Allowed                       |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the Helm repository allowing duplicate chart entries within the index file. The Helm client then uses the last entry which allows an attacker to inject a bad chart into the repository. This aligns with CWE-694 (Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier) because the Helm repository uses multiple chart entries with the same identifier (chart name) and the last one is used, leading to the vulnerability. The **root cause** is the lack of deduplication allowing the **weakness** to exist.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
