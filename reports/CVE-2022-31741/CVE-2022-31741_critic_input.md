# Critic Input for CVE-2022-31741



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
A crafted CMS message could have been processed incorrectly, leading to an **invalid memory read**, and potentially further memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **invalid memory read**
- **impact:** potentially further memory corruption
- **vector:** crafted CMS message
- **product:** Thunderbird and Firefox and Firefox ESR
- **version:** < 91.10 and < 101 and < 91.10

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-31741:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an uninitialized variable (`dp`) within the `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishSingle` function in Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) library.
- The `dp` variable is intended to be initialized by a successful call to `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishMultiple`. However, under certain conditions (specifically when `cmsdigcx->saw_contents == 0`), `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishMultiple` can return success without actually initializing `dp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Uninitialized Variable:** The primary weakness is the usage of an uninitialized variable. When `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishMultiple` doesn't initialize `dp`, subsequent code attempts to dereference `dp` leading to undefined behavior.
- **Incorrect Function Contract:** The contract of `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishMultiple` is flawed, as it can return `SECSuccess` without initializing its output parameter under certain conditions. This violates the expectation that the output parameter would be initialized on success.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The uninitialized `dp` variable, when dereferenced, results in either:
  - A crash due to attempting to read from an invalid memory location
  - An invalid memory read, where the program reads from a random memory location. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash or further memory corruption if the attacker can control the uninitialized value.
- **Arbitrary Memory Read:** If the attacker can groom the stack memory, the uninitialized `dp` pointer could point to attacker controlled data, allowing the attacker to read `dp[0]->len` bytes from the `dp[0]->data` into an object.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted CMS Message:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted CMS message to `NSS_CMSDecoder_Update`. This function is used by applications like Thunderbird and Evolution when dealing with S/MIME encrypted emails.
- **Add-on Signature Verification:** The vulnerability can also be triggered in Firefox by parsing PKCS#7 signatures during add-on verification, as `NSS_CMSMessage_CreateFromDER` is used in that process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to send/deliver a crafted CMS message:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted CMS message to a vulnerable application such as by sending a malicious S/MIME encrypted email or by creating a malicious add-on.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code Path:** The attacker needs to craft the CMS message in a way that causes the vulnerable code path to be executed, specifically where `cmsdigcx->saw_contents == 0` in `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishMultiple`.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability centers around the use of an **uninitialized variable** `dp` within the `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishSingle` function. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the primary weakness is the **usage of an uninitialized variable**. When `NSS_CMSDigestContext_FinishMultiple` returns success without initializing `dp` (due to `cmsdigcx->saw_contents == 0`), subsequent code attempts to dereference `dp`, leading to undefined behavior. This aligns perfectly with CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable), which describes the condition where "The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results." The use of a crafted CMS message to trigger this condition is the attack vector, but the underlying problem is the uninitialized variable.
  - *Justification for CWE-125:* Additionally, the uninitialized variable leads to an **invalid memory read**, as the program attempts to read from a random memory location. The vulnerability description mentions "**invalid memory read**", and the CVE summary also details this impact. This aligns with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which describes when "The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer." The high graph score for CWE-125 also supports this selection.
  - *Why not CWE-787:* Although memory corruption is mentioned, the root cause isn't an out-of-bounds write. It stems from an uninitialized variable, making CWE-457 the primary weakness.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-457 is a variant of CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) and CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource). CWE-125 is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but is more specific to read operations.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials for CWE-457)
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Good evidence for CWE-125 as a secondary weakness)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-908
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-665
CanFollow -> CWE-456

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Assign all variables to an initial value.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Build and Compilation
- **Strategy:** Compilation or Build Hardening
- **Description:** Most compilers will complain about the use of uninitialized variables if warnings are turned on.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Operation
- **Description:** When using a language that does not require explicit declaration of variables, run or compile the software in a mode that reports undeclared or unknown variables. This may indicate the presence of a typographic error in the variable's name.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.
- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

### Extended Description
This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, in Java, if the programmer does not explicitly initialize a variable, then the code could produce a compile-time error (if the variable is local) or automatically initialize the variable to the default value for the variable's type. In Perl, if explicit initialization is not performed, then a default value of undef is assigned, which is interpreted as 0, false, or an equivalent value depending on the context in which the variable is accessed.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Identify all variables and data stores that receive information from external sources, and apply input validation to make sure that they are only initialized to expected values.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Explicitly initialize all your variables and other data stores, either during declaration or just before the first usage.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.
- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.



## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description
When a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Explicitly initialize the resource before use. If this is performed through an API function or standard procedure, follow all required steps.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Pay close attention to complex conditionals that affect initialization, since some branches might not perform the initialization.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Avoid race conditions (CWE-362) during initialization routines.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.
- **CVE-2008-2934:** Free of an uninitialized pointer leads to crash and possible code execution.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
