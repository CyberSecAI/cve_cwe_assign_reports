# Analysis for CVE-2021-46157

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 0.85 | Variant | Allowed | The vulnerability is a **buffer over-read** while parsing NEU files. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability also exhibits a **memory corruption** issue, which can lead to out-of-bounds writes. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **buffer over-read** issue when parsing NEU files, making CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) the most appropriate primary CWE. The description also mentions **memory corruption**, which can be related to out-of-bounds write, suggesting CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a secondary issue. CWE-126 is a Variant level CWE, which is preferred. The CVE reference summary points to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing NEU files.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and is related to other buffer-related weaknesses like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a child of CWE-119.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence for CWE-126, Medium for CWE-787 due to memory corruption implying potential writes)
