# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-46157

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 0.85 | Variant | Allowed | The vulnerability is a **buffer over-read** while parsing NEU files. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability also exhibits a **memory corruption** issue, which can lead to out-of-bounds writes. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **buffer over-read** issue when parsing NEU files, making CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) the most appropriate primary CWE. The description also mentions **memory corruption**, which can be related to out-of-bounds write, suggesting CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a secondary issue. CWE-126 is a Variant level CWE, which is preferred. The CVE reference summary points to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing NEU files.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and is related to other buffer-related weaknesses like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a child of CWE-119.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence for CWE-126, Medium for CWE-787 due to memory corruption implying potential writes)

## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
