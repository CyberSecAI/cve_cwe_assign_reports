# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an "**out of bounds write**" due to an "**incorrect calculation of buffer size**". This directly aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this. CWE-787 is selected as the primary CWE because the immediate result of the vulnerability is the out-of-bounds write. CWE-131 is added as a secondary CWE because it's the root cause that leads to the out-of-bounds write. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. MITRE mapping guidance indicates that both are ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-131 can precede CWE-119 as an incorrect buffer size calculation can cause out-of-bounds writes.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference)
