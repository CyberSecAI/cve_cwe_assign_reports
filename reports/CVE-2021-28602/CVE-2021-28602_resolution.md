# Final Resolution for CVE-2021-28602

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | If deeper analysis reveals a clear chain of events where, for example, an improper input validation leads to the out-of-bounds write, then consider adding CWE-1284 as a secondary CWE and explain the chain. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**), a base level CWE. The secondary CWE, CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**), could potentially precede CWE-787 if the crafted file contains a size that is not validated, leading to the out-of-bounds write.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted file. If **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** is present, the chain begins there, where the crafted file contains a size or length that is not properly validated. This leads to **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, where the product writes data past the end of the intended buffer, resulting in memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identifies CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description stating "memory corruption vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted file" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirming an "**Out-of-bounds Write**". The confidence level of 1.0 is maintained due to the explicit information. The criticism suggests considering CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**) as a secondary CWE if there is evidence of improper input validation leading to the out-of-bounds write.

Based on the provided information, the assessment concludes that CWE-787 is the most appropriate primary classification. The possibility of CWE-1284 as a secondary classification is considered but requires further investigation to confirm the presence of improper input validation in the vulnerability. Without additional evidence, the confidence in including CWE-1284 is lower (0.6).
