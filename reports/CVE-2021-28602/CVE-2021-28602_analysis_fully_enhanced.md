# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-28602

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**memory corruption** vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted file". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is an "**Out-of-bounds Write**" in Adobe After Effects. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses this weakness, where a product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The description of the vulnerability aligns perfectly with the characteristics of CWE-787. The impact, which is arbitrary code execution, further supports this classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE and has relationships to other CWEs related to buffer overflows and memory corruption.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
