# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-11267 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Acceptable-Use |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | Acceptable-Use |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **"Stack out-of-bounds write"** occurs. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses this type of weakness, where data is written beyond the intended buffer's boundaries. The description indicates that providing an IV length exceeding the maximum limit results in the out-of-bounds write. This aligns perfectly with CWE-787's core characteristic. The high retriever score and the explicit mention of out-of-bounds write in the description contribute to a high confidence level. CWE-1284 is included as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability occurs due to an improper validation of the IV length, a specified quantity in input.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and has parent relationships to more specific buffer overflow variants (CWE-121, CWE-122, etc.). This hierarchical relationship confirms that CWE-787 is the most appropriate base-level CWE for this vulnerability. CWE-1284 is related to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), and this relationship indicates that the root cause is a failure to properly validate the input length before using it to set up the cipher device.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description directly matching CWE-787 and supporting information hinting at a related input validation issue)
