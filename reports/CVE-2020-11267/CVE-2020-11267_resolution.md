# Final Resolution for CVE-2020-11267

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Acceptable-Use |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Acceptable-Use |

**Primary CWEs:** CWE-787
**Secondary Candidate CWEs:** CWE-1284

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is the cause-and-effect chain where improper validation of input quantity (**CWE-1284**) leads to an out-of-bounds write (**CWE-787**). **CWE-787** is a child of **CWE-119** (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating that it is a specific type of memory safety issue. **CWE-1284** is related to **CWE-20** (Improper Input Validation), highlighting the root cause of the vulnerability. The relationship between **CWE-1284** and **CWE-787** is that the former *CanPrecede* the latter in a vulnerability chain. While **CWE-121** was considered as a more specific variant of **CWE-787**, sticking with **CWE-787** provides a more general and acceptable base-level classification.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **ROOTCAUSE** being **CWE-1284** (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) where the IV length is not properly validated. This leads to the **WEAKNESS**, **CWE-787** (Out-of-bounds Write), where the program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack. The consequence is a potential crash, arbitrary code execution, or other security impacts.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified **CWE-787** as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of "Stack out-of-bounds write" in the vulnerability description. The inclusion of **CWE-1284** as a secondary weakness is also valid, as the improper validation of the IV length is the underlying cause.

The criticism suggested considering **CWE-121** (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as a more specific variant of **CWE-787**. While **CWE-121** might be applicable, the description doesn't provide enough detail to definitively confirm a buffer overflow, so sticking with **CWE-787** is more appropriate. The criticism also suggested considering **CWE-1285** (Improper Validation of Index/Position/Offset) as an alternative to **CWE-1284**. However, since the IV length is more of a general quantity rather than a direct index or offset, **CWE-1284** remains the more accurate choice.

The graph relationships confirm that the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-787** is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the out-of-bounds write, and **CWE-1284** is a base-level CWE that captures the root cause of the vulnerability.

The final decision is to keep **CWE-787** as the primary weakness and **CWE-1284** as a secondary weakness, with a slightly increased confidence score for **CWE-1284** based on the more detailed analysis. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the relationship analysis both support this classification.
