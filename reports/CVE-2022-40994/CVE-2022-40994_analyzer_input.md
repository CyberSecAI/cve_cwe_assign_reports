# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-40994

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no firmwall keyword WORD description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to construct strings based on user-provided input without proper size validation, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially-crafted network packets to the vulnerable router.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a sequence of requests to the device. This likely requires a privileged network position or successful authentication to the router management interface."
