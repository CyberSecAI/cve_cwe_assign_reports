# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3610

## Vulnerability Description
A **heap-based buffer overflow** vulnerability was found in ImageMagick in versions prior to 7.0.11-14 in ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c. This issue is due to an incorrect setting of the pixel array size, which can lead to a crash and segmentation fault.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect setting of pixel array size**
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** crash and segmentation fault
- **product:** ImageMagick
- **version:** prior to 7.0.11-14
- **component:** ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3610:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2021-3610 and describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in ImageMagick. This aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `ReadTIFFImage()` function within `coders/tiff.c` of ImageMagick.
- The root cause is an incorrect calculation of the `extent` variable, which is used to determine the size of a memory allocation via `AcquireQuantumMemory`.
- The calculated `extent` was too small, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when converting stripped TIFF images.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Heap-based buffer overflow: A memory buffer is allocated on the heap, and data is written beyond its boundaries.
- Incorrect size calculation: The size of the allocated memory for the pixel array is miscalculated, resulting in a smaller buffer than required.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- The primary impact of successful exploitation is a crash or segmentation fault due to out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in a denial of service.
- An attacker may also be able to overwrite adjacent memory on the heap.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted TIFF image.
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious TIFF image to ImageMagick.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to pass a crafted TIFF image to an application that uses the vulnerable ImageMagick library.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned in the provided information.

**Additional details from the content:**

- **Affected versions:** ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.0-0 and 7.0.11-14 are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The issue was addressed in commit `930ff0d1a9bc42925a7856e9ea53f5fc9f318bf3` which recalculates the `extent` to be a larger value and subsequent patches.
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `b874d50070557eb98bdc6a3095ef4769af583dd2` for version 6.9.10.88.
-  Partial fixes were introduced in versions Imagemagick6 <= 6.9.10-92, Imagemagick6 <= 6.9.11-10, and ImageMagick6 <= 6.9.11-54
-  Final fixes were introduced in ImageMagick6 [2/2] commit `c75ae771a00c38b757c5ef4b424b51e761b02552`
-  The fix involves modifying the calculation of the `extent` variable in `coders/tiff.c`.
- Red Hat tracks this issue under Bugzilla ID 1973689.
