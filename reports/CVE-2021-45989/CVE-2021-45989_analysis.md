# Analysis for CVE-2021-45989

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. This CWE accurately describes the vulnerability where a buffer on the stack is overwritten. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack overflow**" in the `guestWifiRuleRefresh` function of Tenda routers. The attack vector involves `qosGuestUpstream` and `qosGuestDownstream` parameters, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) precisely matches this scenario, where a buffer allocated on the stack is overwritten, causing the DoS. The description provides clear evidence of the weakness and the affected component.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a Variant and has no direct relationships found but it is a type of Buffer Overflow. The vulnerability description focuses on the stack, making CWE-121 the most specific and appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the clear mention of "stack overflow" and the attack vector involving specific parameters.)
