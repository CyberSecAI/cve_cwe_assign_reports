## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the root cause as an "**overly permissive cross-domain policy**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that "The User Behavior Analytics application add-on for IBM QRadar SIEM has an **overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy**." CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains) directly addresses this weakness, making it the most appropriate mapping. The retriever results also list CWE-942 as the top match.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-942 is a Variant of CWE-183 (Permissive List of Allowed Inputs) and CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints). While CWE-183 and CWE-923 are related, CWE-942 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability related to cross-domain policies.

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-40128**: A vulnerability in the account activation feature of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send an account activation email with an activation link that points to an arbitrary domain. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the account activation page of Cisco Webex Meetings. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send to any recipient an account activation email that contains a tampered activation link, which could direct the user to an attacker-controlled website.
- **CVE-2021-21415**: Prisma VS Code a VSCode extension for Prisma schema files. This is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability that affects all versions of the Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0. If a custom binary path for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that sets a value for "prismaFmtBinPath". That custom binary is executed when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation checks are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in versions 2.20.0 and 20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file or check if the binary is malicious and delete it.

This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Allowlist / Allow List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is denylist.
Safelist / Safe List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Whitelist / White List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-697
CanPrecede -> CWE-434
ParentOf -> CWE-942

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

- **CVE-2017-1000095:** sandbox bypass using unsafe methods that are on an allowlist



## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering
- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default



## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.

### Extended Description


A cross-domain policy file ("crossdomain.xml" in Flash and "clientaccesspolicy.xml" in Silverlight) defines a list of domains from which a server is allowed to make cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight client will first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found, and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.


Therefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains.


An overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). Once the user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.


In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-863
ChildOf -> CWE-923
ChildOf -> CWE-183
CanPrecede -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Avoid using wildcards in the cross-domain policy file. Any domain matching the wildcard expression will be implicitly trusted, and can perform two-way interaction with the target server.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** For Flash, modify crossdomain.xml to use meta-policy options such as 'master-only' or 'none' to reduce the possibility of an attacker planting extraneous cross-domain policy files on a server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** For Flash, modify crossdomain.xml to use meta-policy options such as 'master-only' or 'none' to reduce the possibility of an attacker planting extraneous cross-domain policy files on a server.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2012-2292:** Product has a Silverlight cross-domain policy that does not restrict access to another application, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy.
- **CVE-2014-2049:** The default Flash Cross Domain policies in a product allows remote attackers to access user files.
- **CVE-2007-6243:** Chain: Adobe Flash Player does not sufficiently restrict the interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
