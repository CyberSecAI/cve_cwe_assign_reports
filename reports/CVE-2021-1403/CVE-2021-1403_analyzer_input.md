# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-1403

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH) attack and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient HTTP protections** in the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the web UI to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt memory on the affected device, forcing it to reload and causing a DoS condition.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in Cisco devices running vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS XE software with the HTTP server feature enabled. The default state of the HTTP Server is version and platform dependent. The HTTP Server feature is enabled if the 'ip http server' or 'ip http secure-server' commands are present in the device configuration. If the configuration also contains 'ip http active-session-modules none' (for HTTP) or 'ip http secure-active-session-modules none' (for HTTPS), the vulnerability is not exploitable over that specific protocol. No workarounds are available beyond disabling the HTTP server feature."
