## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The software constructs a code segment using externally influenced input without properly neutralizing special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code. This is a code injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Code Injection (CWE-94): The software is susceptible to code injection due to improper handling of external input when constructing code segments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this code injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to take full control of the digital fault recorder (DFR), remotely execute code, and escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the input that the software uses to construct a code segment.
- The attacker would require network access to the affected device.
