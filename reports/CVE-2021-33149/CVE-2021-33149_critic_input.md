## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an "**observable behavioral discrepancy**" in Intel processors, which directly aligns with CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by stating "**Observable behavioral discrepancy** in some Intel(R) Processors" as one of the **weaknesses**. The vulnerability allows an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access, and the **root_cause** is "Improper conditions check in voltage settings." This behavioral difference, observable to a local user, can lead to information disclosure. CWE-203 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-203 is a parent of several more specific CWEs, including CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy), CWE-205 (Observable Behavioral Discrepancy), and CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy). While the description doesn't provide enough detail to pinpoint the specific type of discrepancy, the general "observable discrepancy" makes CWE-203 the most fitting primary classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "observable behavioral discrepancy" and supporting details in the CVE Reference Links)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-205 (Observable Behavioral Discrepancy) is a potential secondary candidate. The vulnerability description specifically mentions "Observable behavioral discrepancy," which directly aligns with CWE-205. This weakness allows information disclosure, suggesting that the internal state or decision process of the processor can be inferred from its behavior. CWE-205 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance. It's more specific than CWE-203, but without more details on the nature of the discrepancy, it is not the best primary match.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-205 is a child of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). This relationship supports its consideration as a secondary candidate, providing a slightly more specific categorization of the observed discrepancy.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence as the information is not detailed enough to select this as the primary CWE)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) is another potential candidate since timing discrepancies could potentially lead to information disclosure. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention timing, making this a less direct fit. CWE-208 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-208 is a child of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). The connection to the parent CWE supports its consideration as a possible secondary candidate, although less strongly than CWE-205.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Low confidence as the vulnerability description does not specifically mention any timing discrepancies)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is a potential candidate, as different responses from the processor could reveal internal state. However, similar to CWE-208, the description does not explicitly detail the nature of the discrepancy as a response-based issue. CWE-204 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-204 is a child of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). This relationship suggests that it could be a contributing factor, but its relevance is limited by the lack of specific evidence in the vulnerability description.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.55 (Low confidence because there is no specific information about response-based issues)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203
CanPrecede -> CWE-385
CanPrecede -> CWE-327
ParentOf -> CWE-1254

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.



## CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.

### Extended Description
Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203
CanPrecede -> CWE-514
ParentOf -> CWE-206
ParentOf -> CWE-207

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0208:** Product modifies TCP/IP stack and ICMP error messages in unusual ways that show the product is in use.
- **CVE-2004-2252:** Behavioral infoleak by responding to SYN-FIN packets.



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).

### Alternative Terms
None

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.


If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.


Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** can overlap errors related to escalated privileges



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2094:** This, and others, use ".." attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses
- **CVE-2001-1528:** Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
Side Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.
