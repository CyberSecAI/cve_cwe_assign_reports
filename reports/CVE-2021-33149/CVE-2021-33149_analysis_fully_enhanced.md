## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an "**observable behavioral discrepancy**" in Intel processors, which directly aligns with CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by stating "**Observable behavioral discrepancy** in some Intel(R) Processors" as one of the **weaknesses**. The vulnerability allows an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access, and the **root_cause** is "Improper conditions check in voltage settings." This behavioral difference, observable to a local user, can lead to information disclosure. CWE-203 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-203 is a parent of several more specific CWEs, including CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy), CWE-205 (Observable Behavioral Discrepancy), and CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy). While the description doesn't provide enough detail to pinpoint the specific type of discrepancy, the general "observable discrepancy" makes CWE-203 the most fitting primary classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "observable behavioral discrepancy" and supporting details in the CVE Reference Links)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-205 (Observable Behavioral Discrepancy) is a potential secondary candidate. The vulnerability description specifically mentions "Observable behavioral discrepancy," which directly aligns with CWE-205. This weakness allows information disclosure, suggesting that the internal state or decision process of the processor can be inferred from its behavior. CWE-205 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance. It's more specific than CWE-203, but without more details on the nature of the discrepancy, it is not the best primary match.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-205 is a child of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). This relationship supports its consideration as a secondary candidate, providing a slightly more specific categorization of the observed discrepancy.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence as the information is not detailed enough to select this as the primary CWE)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) is another potential candidate since timing discrepancies could potentially lead to information disclosure. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention timing, making this a less direct fit. CWE-208 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-208 is a child of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). The connection to the parent CWE supports its consideration as a possible secondary candidate, although less strongly than CWE-205.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Low confidence as the vulnerability description does not specifically mention any timing discrepancies)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is a potential candidate, as different responses from the processor could reveal internal state. However, similar to CWE-208, the description does not explicitly detail the nature of the discrepancy as a response-based issue. CWE-204 is a base-level CWE and is ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-204 is a child of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). This relationship suggests that it could be a contributing factor, but its relevance is limited by the lack of specific evidence in the vulnerability description.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.55 (Low confidence because there is no specific information about response-based issues)



## Known Examples for CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10071](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10071): Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10482](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10482): Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0984](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0984): Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.
- **CVE-2003-0078** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0078](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0078): SSL implementation does not perform a MAC computation if an incorrect block cipher padding is used, which causes an information leak (timing discrepancy) that may make it easier to launch cryptographic attacks that rely on distinguishing between padding and MAC verification errors, possibly leading to extraction of the original plaintext, aka the "Vaudenay timing attack."
- **CVE-2000-1117** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1117](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1117): Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.
- **CVE-2003-0637** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0637](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0637): Product uses a shorter timeout for a non-existent user than a valid user, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess usernames and conduct brute force password guessing.
- **CVE-2003-0190** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0190](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0190): Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.
- **CVE-2004-1602** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1602](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1602): FTP server responds in a different amount of time when a given username exists, which allows remote attackers to identify valid usernames by timing the server response.
- **CVE-2005-0918** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0918](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0918): Browser allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files by setting the src property to the target filename and using Javascript to determine if the web page immediately stops loading, which indicates whether the file exists or not.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-31403**: Non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens in UIDL request handler in com.vaadin:vaadin-server versions 7.0.0 through 7.7.23 (Vaadin 7.0.0 through 7.7.23), and 8.0.0 through 8.12.2 (Vaadin 8.0.0 through 8.12.2) allows attacker to guess a security token via timing attack
