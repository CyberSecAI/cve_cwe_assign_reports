# Critic Input for CVE-2020-15128



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468).

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue is that encrypted cookie values were not cryptographically tied to the cookie name. This means that an attacker could potentially reuse encrypted cookie values across different cookies if they had the ability to control content in a cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of cookie name binding:** The encryption process didn't include the cookie's name, making it possible to interchange encrypted values between cookies.
*   **Potential for replay attacks:** An attacker could potentially reuse encrypted values from one cookie in another cookie, if the attacker could control the initial cookie value.
*   **Exposure of plaintext values:** If the plaintext value of an encrypted cookie was exposed to the user, they could potentially use this to forge other encrypted cookies.
*   **Dependence on other vulnerabilities:**  This vulnerability is not directly exploitable without other vulnerabilities in the application to expose the plaintext or encrypted cookie values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie value substitution:** An attacker could potentially substitute an encrypted value from one cookie for another, potentially gaining unauthorized access or manipulating application behavior.
*   **Data exfiltration:** If an application stored user-provided data in cookies, an attacker could manipulate the application to disclose encrypted content or inject manipulated encrypted content.
*   **Session invalidation:** While the fix attempts to handle session cookies gracefully, users could potentially be logged out if the session driver uses cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-provided input:** If the application allows user-provided input to be stored in a cookie without proper sanitization and handling, an attacker could control the content of the encrypted cookie.
*   **Exposure of encrypted or plaintext values:** If the application exposes encrypted cookie values or their plaintext versions to the user, an attacker could leverage those to construct malicious cookie values.
*   **Man-in-the-middle:** If the attacker can intercept and modify the cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control or read cookie values:** The attacker needs the ability to control the value of a cookie or read the encrypted or plaintext value of a cookie in the targeted application.
*   **Understanding of the application's behavior:** An understanding of the application's logic is required to know which cookies to target and how to inject manipulated values.
*   **Ability to introduce other vulnerabilities**:  The exploit relies on other vulnerabilities within the application to be exploitable in the first place.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Laravel and reported to the October CMS team by Taylor Otwell.
*   The fix was implemented by prefixing the cookie value with a hash of the cookie name and encryption key using HMAC-SHA1 (with "v2" added to the hash input), ensuring that the encrypted value is tied to a specific cookie name.
*  The fix invalidates all existing cookies except the October CMS session cookie (which is updated in the response.)
* The vulnerability was assessed as low severity because it requires other vulnerabilities to be exploited.
* This is a more detailed analysis than the official CVE description.

**Summary:**
The core issue is a lack of proper binding between cookie names and their encrypted values, allowing for potential substitution attacks. The fix implements a cookie prefix to validate the cookie's origin. This is a low-severity vulnerability requiring other application vulnerabilities to be exploited, but can lead to session hijacking or data leakage.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability lies in the fact that encrypted cookie values are not tied to the name of the cookie. This allows an attacker to potentially reuse cookie values across different cookies if they have control over the content in a cookie. This directly relates to **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)** because without the cookie name binding, the encrypted value *could* be transmitted and used for other cookies, potentially revealing sensitive information if those other cookies are not properly secured. The CVE Reference mentions the exposure of plaintext values as well. Itâ€™s not clear if the sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext, but the weakness makes it vulnerable to it. The relationship analysis shows the exposure to plaintext values means that the cookie is not being used properly, which exposes the sensitive information. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-319 indicates this is ALLOWED for cases where sensitive data is transmitted without proper protection."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-319 is a Base level CWE. The vulnerability description states that the cookie's encrypted value could be exposed. The graph relationships show that this can lead to information disclosure."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability involves the encryption of cookie values without tying them to the cookie name. This could be seen as a form of **CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm)** because the encryption process is incomplete and doesn't provide the necessary security guarantees, such as preventing replay attacks or unauthorized substitution. However, the primary issue is the lack of cookie name binding, making the encryption process vulnerable to the specific attack. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-327 indicates this is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW because it is a Class-level CWE."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-327 is a Class level CWE, and there may be a more specific child CWE. However, without more details about the encryption algorithm, this is the closest match."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.40 (Low evidence because it's a potential related issue, but not the primary weakness)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

When there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.


For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification [REF-1192].


Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.


Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [REF-267]


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Description:** Ensure that the design allows one cryptographic algorithm to be replaced with another in the next generation or version. Where possible, use wrappers to make the interfaces uniform. This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms. With hardware, design the product at the Intellectual Property (IP) level so that one cryptographic algorithm can be replaced with another in the next generation of the hardware product.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys (see CWE-320). If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography itself is irrelevant.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.
