# Critic Input for CVE-2021-3674



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in rizin. The create_section_from_phdr function allocates space for ELF section data by processing the headers. Crafted values in the headers can cause **out of bounds reads**, which can lead to memory corruption and possibly code execution through the binary objects callback function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **out of bounds reads**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **vector:** Crafted values in the headers
- **product:** rizin
- **component:** create_section_from_phdr function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `vector_free_elems` function when parsing an ELF file with corrupted section headers. Specifically, when section headers are invalid, the `RzBinElfSection->name` pointer, which is supposed to point to the section name, can be overwritten with arbitrary data. This happens due to improper handling of corrupted section offsets during the creation of RzVectors for different sections in the binary.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to a use-after-free condition. The `vector_free_elems` iterates over `RzVector` structures that store section data. The `RzVector->free` callback (`rz_bin_elf_section_free`) attempts to `free()` the `RzBinElfSection->name` member. If a crafted or corrupted binary with invalid section offsets is parsed, this `name` pointer may be overwritten with an invalid memory address on the heap. When the code later attempts to `free()` this overwritten pointer, it results in a double-free or a free of an arbitrary memory address, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.
- **Uncontrolled Pointer Dereference:** The corrupted section headers lead to an uncontrolled pointer dereference when attempting to free the potentially invalid `RzBinElfSection->name` pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service. As evidenced by the provided crash logs, the incorrect free operation in `vector_free_elems` causes a segmentation fault, crashing the `rizin` tool. This makes it unusable for analyzing specially crafted ELF files.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities like this can sometimes be exploited for more serious issues, such as arbitrary code execution if an attacker can reliably control the value of the overwritten pointer and the state of the heap. However, the provided material only shows the crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious ELF file:** An attacker could craft a malicious ELF file with corrupted or invalid section headers. Loading or analyzing this file via `rizin` or `rz-bin` triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to provide a specially crafted ELF file to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through several means, including tricking a user into analyzing a malicious file or providing it as input to automated tooling that uses `rizin`.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The provided POC file contains the pattern `0xacabacabacabacab` within the section headers, which becomes the target of the free operation, demonstrating that the attacker can control the memory address to be freed.
- The vulnerability was fixed in pull request #1313, which also addresses related warnings when there are no sections in the binary.
- Test cases were created in rizin-testbins to confirm the fix.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**out of bounds reads**" which aligns directly with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section further elaborates that invalid section headers lead to memory corruption because the `RzBinElfSection->name` pointer can be overwritten with arbitrary data and later freed, leading to a double-free condition. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section describes a free of an arbitrary memory address, which leads to a crash or other undefined behavior.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a base level CWE, and the description aligns closely with the vulnerability. The retriever results also give it the highest score. While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset) are related, CWE-125 is the most accurate representation of the **out-of-bounds read** issue. The double-free condition can be represented with CWE-415, a variant level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.


Programs may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.


If an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.


### Alternative Terms
Untrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of "out-of-range" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

### Alternative Terms
Double-free

ChildOf -> CWE-672

CanFollow -> CWE-364

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that each allocation is freed only once. After freeing a chunk, set the pointer to NULL to ensure the pointer cannot be freed again. In complicated error conditions, be sure that clean-up routines respect the state of allocation properly. If the language is object oriented, ensure that object destructors delete each chunk of memory only once.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Use a static analysis tool to find double free instances.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).
- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
