## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper output neutralization** for Logs".

This directly aligns with CWE-117, "Improper Output Neutralization for Logs". The description and summary both indicate that an authenticated user can forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs, further supporting the classification as CWE-117. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-117 indicates this is ALLOWED.
