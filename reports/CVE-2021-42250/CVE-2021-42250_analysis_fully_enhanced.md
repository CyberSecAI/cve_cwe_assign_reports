# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-42250

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-117 | Improper Output Neutralization for Logs | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper output neutralization** for Logs". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper output neutralization for Logs." This directly aligns with CWE-117, "Improper Output Neutralization for Logs". The description and summary both indicate that an authenticated user can forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs, further supporting the classification as CWE-117. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-117 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-117 is a Base level CWE, there isn't a more specific CWE to select. No direct relationships found.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of improper output neutralization for logs in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary.)



## Known Examples for CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-4624** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4624](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4624): Chain: inject fake log entries with fake timestamps using CRLF injection
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-42250**: Improper output neutralization for Logs. A specific Apache Superset HTTP endpoint allowed for an authenticated user to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs.
- **CVE-2020-4851**: IBM Spectrum Scale 5.0.0 through 5.0.5.5 and 5.1.0 through 5.1.0.2 could allow a local user to poison log files which could impact support and development efforts. IBM X-Force ID: 190450.
- **CVE-2021-40323**: Cobbler before 3.3.0 allows log poisoning, and resultant Remote Code Execution, via an XMLRPC method that logs to the logfile for template injection.
- **CVE-2021-42010**: Heron versions <= 0.20.4-incubating allows CRLF log injection because of the lack of escaping in the log statements. Please update to version 0.20.5-incubating which addresses this issue.
- **CVE-2022-4011**: A vulnerability was found in Simple History Plugin. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component Header Handler. The manipulation of the argument X-Forwarded-For leads to improper output neutralization for logs. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-213785 was assigned to this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2022-43883**:  IBM Cognos Analytics 11.1.7, 11.2.0, and 11.2.1 could be vulnerable to a Log Injection attack by constructing URLs from user-controlled data. This could enable attackers to make arbitrary requests to the internal network or to the local file system. IBM X-Force ID: 240266.
