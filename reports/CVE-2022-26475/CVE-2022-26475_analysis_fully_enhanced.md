# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                         | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**out of bounds write** due to a **missing bounds check**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms "A missing bounds check in the wlan component leads to an out-of-bounds write." This directly aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which describes the product writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. The **missing bounds check** is the root cause that leads to this **out-of-bounds write**. CWE-787 is a base level CWE and the mapping guidance indicates it is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base CWE that is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is more specific than CWE-119 due to the explicit mention of a write operation.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
