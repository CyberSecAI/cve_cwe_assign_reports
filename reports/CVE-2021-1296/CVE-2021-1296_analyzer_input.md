# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-1296

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct **directory traversal** attacks and overwrite certain files that should be restricted on an affected system. These vulnerabilities are due to **insufficient input validation**. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using the web-based management interface to upload a file to location on an affected device that they should not have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on the file system of the affected device.
