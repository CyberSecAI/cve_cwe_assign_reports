# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-31620

## Vulnerability Description
In libjpeg before 1.64, BitStreamGet in bitstream.hpp has an assertion failure that may cause denial of service. This is related to **out-of-bounds array access** during arithmetically coded lossless scan or arithmetically coded sequential scan.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **out-of-bounds array access**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** arithmetically coded lossless scan and arithmetically coded sequential scan
- **product:** libjpeg
- **version:** before 1.64
- **component:** BitStreamGet in bitstream.hpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking during the decoding of lossless JPEG images, specifically within the arithmetic coding procedures and lossless symbol decoding. Out-of-bounds symbols could trigger out-of-bounds array access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The decoder could read beyond the allocated memory when processing specially crafted JPEG files, due to missing checks during symbol decoding in `BitStream<false>::Get`
- **Assertion failure:** An assertion in `BitStream<false>::Get` could be triggered by providing a crafted input that results in `bits > 0 && bits <= 24` condition failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability could lead to a crash of the application, causing a denial of service. This was identified by an assertion failure. As noted by the reporter, this is especially relevant when libjpeg is used in a service context.
- **Potential other memory corruption:** It's possible that other memory corruption issues could arise from the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious JPEG Files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted, malicious JPEG file to the library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide a malicious file:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG file to the vulnerable application or system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a stack trace, that shows that the `BitStream<false>::Get()` method can receive an invalid bits parameter (in the case reported, 236), that triggers the assertion.
- The fix implemented included out-of-bounds checks for lossless symbol decoding and AC context, specifically:
  - Checking if the parsed symbol is within valid range before processing the symbol in `LosslessScan::ParseMCU`.
  - Added explicit checks in the arithmetic decoding loops in `ACLosslessScan::ParseMCU`, `ACSequentialScan::DecodeBlock` to avoid out of bounds array access.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.64 of the libjpeg library.
