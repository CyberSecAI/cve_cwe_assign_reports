# Critic Input for CVE-2022-31620



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
In libjpeg before 1.64, BitStreamGet in bitstream.hpp has an assertion failure that may cause denial of service. This is related to **out-of-bounds array access** during arithmetically coded lossless scan or arithmetically coded sequential scan.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **out-of-bounds array access**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** arithmetically coded lossless scan and arithmetically coded sequential scan
- **product:** libjpeg
- **version:** before 1.64
- **component:** BitStreamGet in bitstream.hpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking during the decoding of lossless JPEG images, specifically within the arithmetic coding procedures and lossless symbol decoding. Out-of-bounds symbols could trigger out-of-bounds array access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The decoder could read beyond the allocated memory when processing specially crafted JPEG files, due to missing checks during symbol decoding in `BitStream<false>::Get`
- **Assertion failure:** An assertion in `BitStream<false>::Get` could be triggered by providing a crafted input that results in `bits > 0 && bits <= 24` condition failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability could lead to a crash of the application, causing a denial of service. This was identified by an assertion failure. As noted by the reporter, this is especially relevant when libjpeg is used in a service context.
- **Potential other memory corruption:** It's possible that other memory corruption issues could arise from the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious JPEG Files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted, malicious JPEG file to the library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide a malicious file:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG file to the vulnerable application or system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a stack trace, that shows that the `BitStream<false>::Get()` method can receive an invalid bits parameter (in the case reported, 236), that triggers the assertion.
- The fix implemented included out-of-bounds checks for lossless symbol decoding and AC context, specifically:
  - Checking if the parsed symbol is within valid range before processing the symbol in `LosslessScan::ParseMCU`.
  - Added explicit checks in the arithmetic decoding loops in `ACLosslessScan::ParseMCU`, `ACSequentialScan::DecodeBlock` to avoid out of bounds array access.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.64 of the libjpeg library.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as an **out-of-bounds array access** in `BitStreamGet` within libjpeg. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking during the decoding of lossless JPEG images" and "decoder could read beyond the allocated memory." This aligns directly with the description of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which states: "The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer." The impact is a denial of service, which is a common consequence of out-of-bounds reads. The Retriever Results also identify CWE-125 as a highly relevant candidate with a good score. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-125 indicates that it is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-125 is more specific and accurately describes the **out-of-bounds read**. CWE-125 can precede CWE-824 (Access of a Resource Using a Pointer that Has Been Dereferenced).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to clear evidence of out-of-bounds read and supporting CVE details.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions an "assertion failure that may cause denial of service." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary elaborates, stating "An assertion in `BitStream<false>::Get` could be triggered by providing a crafted input that results in `bits > 0 && bits <= 24` condition failure." This aligns with CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion), which states: "The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary." While the primary weakness is the out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), the assertion failure is a direct consequence and contributes to the denial of service impact. The Retriever Results identify CWE-617 as a relevant candidate. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-617 indicates that it is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-617 is a child of CWE-670 (Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation). CWE-617 itself doesn't directly relate to CWE-125 in a 'CanPrecede' or 'CanFollow' relationship, but it's a secondary issue directly triggered by the crafted input and leading to denial of service.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (The assertion failure is a secondary effect of the out-of-bounds read.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.



## CWE-670: Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement, leading to incorrect behavior any time this path is navigated.

### Extended Description
This weakness captures cases in which a particular code segment is always incorrect with respect to the algorithm that it is implementing. For example, if a C programmer intends to include multiple statements in a single block but does not include the enclosing braces (CWE-483), then the logic is always incorrect. This issue is in contrast to most weaknesses in which the code usually behaves correctly, except when it is externally manipulated in malicious ways.

### Alternative Terms
None

ParentOf -> CWE-480
ParentOf -> CWE-483
ParentOf -> CWE-484
ParentOf -> CWE-617
ParentOf -> CWE-698
ParentOf -> CWE-783

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This node could possibly be split into lower-level nodes. "Early Return" is for returning control to the caller too soon (e.g., CWE-584). "Excess Return" is when control is returned too far up the call stack (CWE-600, CWE-395). "Improper control limitation" occurs when the product maintains control at a lower level of execution, when control should be returned "further" up the call stack (CWE-455). "Incorrect syntax" covers code that's "just plain wrong" such as CWE-484 and CWE-483.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3011:** virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid value to a register, which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
assertion failure

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-670
ChildOf -> CWE-670
CanFollow -> CWE-193

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Make sensitive open/close operation non reachable by directly user-controlled data (e.g. open/close resources)

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Perform input validation on user data.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2006-6767:** FTP server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon abort) via crafted commands which trigger an assertion failure.
- **CVE-2006-6811:** Chat client allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message string when connecting to a server, which causes an assertion failure.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
