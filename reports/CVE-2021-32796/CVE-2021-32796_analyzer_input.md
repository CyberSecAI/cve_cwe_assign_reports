# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-32796

## Vulnerability Description
xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older **do not correctly escape special characters** when serializing elements removed from their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **do not correctly escape special characters**
- **impact:** unexpected syntactic changes
- **product:** xmldom
- **version:** 0.6.0 and older

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `xmldom` library's failure to properly escape special characters when serializing XML elements that have been removed from their ancestor. Specifically, when an XML document is parsed and then serialized, special characters within attribute values are not consistently escaped if the element is no longer part of its original parent structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Output Handling:** The core weakness is the incorrect handling of special characters (`<`, `&`, `"`) during XML serialization.
- **Inconsistent Escaping:** The library escapes special characters in some scenarios but fails to do so when elements are detached from their original context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XML Syntactic Changes:** Maliciously crafted XML input can be altered during processing because of incorrect serialization. This can lead to unexpected syntactic changes in XML during a round trip (parse and serialize).
- **Potential Application Vulnerabilities:** Downstream applications that process the serialized XML could be impacted if they assume consistent syntax and proper escaping. This may result in application logic errors or potentially security vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious XML Input:** An attacker provides specially crafted XML containing unescaped special characters within attribute values
- **Round-trip Processing:** The target application uses `xmldom` to parse the malicious XML, manipulates the parsed data (specifically removing nodes from their parent), then serializes this modified document using `xmldom`. The serialized output will contain unescaped special characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted XML document that will be processed by a vulnerable application.
- The target application must use `xmldom` for parsing and serialization, and manipulate the parsed data in a way that triggers the vulnerability (i.e., detaching elements from their parents).
- An attacker would need to understand the underlying XML processing logic and be able to introduce XML structures that are then modified (nodes removed from parents) by the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to vulnerabilities discovered in Go's `encoding/xml` library regarding round-trip transformations.
- The fix for this issue involves correctly escaping special characters in attribute values even when the element is no longer part of its ancestor.
- The vulnerability is considered moderate severity.
- The patched versions are `@xmldom/xmldom@>=0.7.0`.
