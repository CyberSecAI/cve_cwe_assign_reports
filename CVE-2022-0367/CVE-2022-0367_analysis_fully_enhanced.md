| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Acceptable-Use |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **heap-based buffer overflow** in `libmodbus`, specifically within the `modbus_reply()` function. The root cause is a copy-paste error in the sanity check that leads to insufficient input validation when handling `MODBUS_FC_WRITE_AND_READ_REGISTERS` requests. This allows an attacker to send a crafted Modbus request with an invalid address offset for writing, which is not properly validated, leading to out-of-bounds access. Given the specific mention of **heap-based buffer overflow** and the description of the mechanism by which it occurs, CWE-122 is the most accurate primary mapping.
  CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap portion of memory.

  The Retriever results contain CWE-122 with a relatively high score.

  CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is considered as a secondary weakness, since the **heap-based buffer overflow** occurs because of missing validation of the write offset address.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a parent of CWE-122.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples
