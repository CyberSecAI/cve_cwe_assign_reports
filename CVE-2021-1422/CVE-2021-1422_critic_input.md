# Critic Input for CVE-2021-1422



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker or an unauthenticated attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to cause an unexpected reload of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a **logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets over an established IPsec connection. A successful exploit could cause the device to crash, forcing it to reload. Important Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would not cause a compromise of any encrypted data. Note This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.1 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.0.0.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that there is a **logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors**. This **logic error** can cause an unexpected reload of the device. The **Retriever Results** identify CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion) as the top candidate with a high score, and CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) with lower score.

  A "reachable assertion" (CWE-617) indicates that an assert statement or similar condition check is triggered due to the **logic error** during decryption, leading to a program exit or unexpected behavior like a device reload. It's plausible because crypto modules often use assertions to validate intermediate results. Given the description mentions a **logic error**, this seems to be the root cause for the **denial of service (DoS)**.

  CWE-755 (Exception Handling Issues) is a broader class of weakness, but the description focuses on a specific **logic error** triggering the crash rather than general exception mismanagement. The Mapping Guidance DISCOURAGES use of CWE-755 and prefers lower-level children which supports the decision to use CWE-617.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-617 has no direct relationships, indicating it is a base level weakness. CWE-755 is a Class, making it less specific than CWE-617.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence aligns with the characteristics of CWE-617).

- **CVE-2021-28090**: Tor before 0.4.5.7 allows a remote attacker to cause Tor directory authorities to exit with an assertion failure, aka TROVE-2021-002.
- **CVE-2021-28543**: Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.


# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
assertion failure

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-670
ChildOf -> CWE-670
CanFollow -> CWE-193

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Make sensitive open/close operation non reachable by directly user-controlled data (e.g. open/close resources)

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Perform input validation on user data.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2006-6767:** FTP server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon abort) via crafted commands which trigger an assertion failure.
- **CVE-2006-6811:** Chat client allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message string when connecting to a server, which causes an assertion failure.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
