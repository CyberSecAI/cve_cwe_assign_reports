- **component:** UEFI DXE driver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of the `gRT->GetVariable` service within the `TcgPlatformSetupPolicy` driver. Specifically, two calls to `gRT->GetVariable` are made sequentially, and they improperly reuse a single `DataSize` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. The first `gRT->GetVariable` call with a large variable ("InternalDisallowTpmFlag") updates the `DataSize` variable with the size of the variable's data. The subsequent `gRT->GetVariable` call, intended to read the "TcgInternalSyncFlag" variable, uses the updated `DataSize`, potentially causing a stack buffer overflow if the second variable's data is larger than the allocated buffer size on the stack.
- **Improper NVRAM Variable Handling:** The code does not properly validate and manage the size of data read from NVRAM variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack, the attacker can overwrite the return address, thus achieving arbitrary code execution within the UEFI DXE driver context.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges from ring 3 or ring 0 (depending on the OS) to DXE Runtime UEFI application.
- **Malicious Code Persistence:** The exploit can be used to install malicious code that survives across OS boot processes because the vulnerability resides in the UEFI firmware, which is loaded before the OS, and NVRAM variables persist between boots. The attacker can modify the NVRAM area in SPI flash storage to gain persistence.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **NVRAM Variable Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating NVRAM variables, setting them to very large string values to cause the stack overflow during the driver execution.
- **UEFI Driver Loading:** The exploit occurs when the vulnerable driver `TcgPlatformSetupPolicy` is loaded during the UEFI boot process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Set NVRAM Variables:** The attacker needs the ability to set the values of specific NVRAM variables (`InternalDisallowTpmFlag` and `TcgInternalSyncFlag`). This may require a privileged position or some access to system configuration.
- **Ability to trigger UEFI Driver Load:** The attacker needs to trigger the loading of the vulnerable UEFI driver.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Models:** The document lists numerous Acer Altos servers and Aspire/Veriton laptop/desktop models that are affected by this vulnerability.
- **Exploitability:** The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates that the vulnerability is readily exploitable, showing the process of overwriting the return address and gaining code execution in the driver. The document even details how to create a simple shellcode to print a string.
- **Vendor Response:** Acer's security team stated the affected models were end-of-life and thus no fix was made available.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack buffer overflow**" vulnerability in the UEFI DXE driver, which perfectly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further elaborates on how the incorrect usage of `gRT->GetVariable` leads to overwriting data on the stack, resulting in arbitrary code execution. CWE-121 is a Variant level CWE, providing a specific classification for this type of buffer overflow. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of the broader CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but the specific nature of the overflow occurring on the stack makes CWE-121 the more appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The description directly indicates a stack buffer overflow, and the reference links confirm the root cause)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
