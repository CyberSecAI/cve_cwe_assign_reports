  "query": "Four format string injection vulnerabilities exist in the UPnP logging functionality of Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit 6.9Z and 6.9X. A specially-crafted UPnP negotiation can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service. An attacker can host a malicious UPnP service to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from format string injection via `ST` and `Location` HTTP response headers, as used within the `DoEnumUPnPService` action handler.",
