## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-22437:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Software integer overflow leading to a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Integer overflow
*   TOCTOU condition

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause random address access.

**Affected Versions:** EMUI 10.1.1, EMUI 10.1.0, Magic UI 3.1.1, Magic UI 3.1.0

**Attack Vectors:** The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but it involves an integer overflow leading to a TOCTOU condition, which suggests a race condition where a check on a resource's state is performed and then the resource is accessed, and the state can change between these steps.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The document doesn't specify the attacker capabilities or position required to exploit this vulnerability.
