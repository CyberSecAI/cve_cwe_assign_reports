# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-36718

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the attacker can log in to the system with **default credentials**. This directly aligns with CWE-1392, which describes the "Use of Default Credentials" for potentially critical functionality. The description also highlights that sensitive data (Employee name, Employee ID number, Working hours etc.) can be accessed after logging in. This exposure of sensitive information as an impact of using **default credentials** reinforces the selection of CWE-1392. The retriever results also give CWE-1392 the highest score, thus giving additional support to this choice. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1392 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1392 is a base-level CWE, making it an appropriate level of abstraction. While CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) could be considered, CWE-1392 is more specific to **default credentials**, which is the explicitly stated **root cause**. There are no direct relationships that strongly influence the mapping, but the overall context points towards the use of **default credentials** as the primary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to direct evidence and retriever score)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions that after logging in with **default credentials**, the attacker can export a report containing sensitive data. This aspect of exporting a report with sensitive data aligns with CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). While the primary issue is the use of **default credentials**, the act of exporting and potentially logging or storing sensitive data represents an additional weakness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-532 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). Although sensitive information is not necessarily logged to a *file*, exporting a report with sensitive data can be considered a similar action that places the information in a persistent medium. The retriever results also support this choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Moderate confidence because CWE-532 is a resulting impact)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-36718**: SYNEL - eharmonynew / Synel Reports - The attacker can log in to the system with default credentials and export a report of eharmony system with sensetive data (Employee name, Employee ID number, Working hours etc') The vulnerabilety has been addressed and fixed on version 11. Default credentials , Security miscommunication , Sensetive data exposure vulnerability in Synel Reports of SYNEL eharmonynew, Synel Reports allows an attacker to log into the system with default credentials. This issue affects: SYNEL eharmonynew, Synel Reports 8.0.2 version 11 and prior versions.
- **CVE-2022-20918**: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) access controls for Cisco FirePOWER Software for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) FirePOWER module, Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, and Cisco Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform an SNMP GET request using a default credential. This vulnerability is due to the presence of a default credential for SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) and SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 GET request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the device using the default credential. This attack will only be successful if SNMP is configured, and the attacker can only perform SNMP GET requests; write access using SNMP is not allowed.
- **CVE-2022-30270**: The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 has default credentials. It exposes an SSH interface on port 22/TCP. This interface is used for remote maintenance and for SFTP file-transfer operations that are part of engineering software functionality. Access to this interface is controlled by 5 preconfigured accounts (root, abuilder, acelogin, cappl, ace), all of which come with default credentials. Although the ACE1000 documentation mentions the root, abuilder and acelogin accounts and instructs users to change the default credentials, the cappl and ace accounts remain undocumented and thus are unlikely to have their credentials changed.
- **CVE-2022-36524**: D-Link GO-RT-AC750 GORTAC750_revA_v101b03 & GO-RT-AC750_revB_FWv200b02 is vulnerable to Static Default Credentials via /etc/init0.d/S80telnetd.sh.
- **CVE-2022-38556**: Trendnet TEW733GR v1.03B01 contains a Static Default Credential vulnerability in /etc/init0.d/S80telnetd.sh.
