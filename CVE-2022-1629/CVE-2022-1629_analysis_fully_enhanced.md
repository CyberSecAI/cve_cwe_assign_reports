# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-1629

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**Buffer Over-read in function find_next_quote**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by mentioning "**Buffer over-read**" as the weakness and "**Trailing backslash may cause reading past end of line**" as the root cause. This aligns directly with CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), which describes a product reading from a buffer using access mechanisms that reference memory locations *after* the targeted buffer. The impact, which includes crashing software and potential remote execution, is consistent with the consequences of a buffer over-read. CWE-126 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that its usage is "Allowed."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). While CWE-125 is a broader category, CWE-126 more accurately describes the specific type of out-of-bounds read occurring in this vulnerability (reading *after* the buffer). CWE-126 can precede CWE-170 (Improper Null Termination) if the over-read leads to a missing null terminator.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results).

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a potential secondary candidate because it is a parent of CWE-126 and the vulnerability involves reading data beyond the intended buffer. However, because the evidence specifically mentions "over-read," CWE-126 is a more precise classification. The retriever results also list CWE-125. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-125 indicates usage is "Allowed."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a broader category that encompasses both over-reads and under-reads. It is a parent of CWE-126.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Supporting evidence as a parent of the primary CWE. Not as strong as the primary CWE).



## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
