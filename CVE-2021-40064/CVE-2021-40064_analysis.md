## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**heap-based buffer overflow**" in system components. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as a "**heap-based buffer overflow**". CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE that directly addresses this type of vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of this CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), a more general class of buffer overflows. Since the description specifically identifies the overflow as heap-based, CWE-122 is the more appropriate and specific choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match with the vulnerability description)
