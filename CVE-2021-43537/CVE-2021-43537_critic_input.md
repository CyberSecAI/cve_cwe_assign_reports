### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers**
- **impact:** crash
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Thunderbird and Firefox ESR and Firefox
- **version:** < 91.4.0 and < 91.4.0 and < 95

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-43537:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect type conversion within the `nsStructuredCloneContainer::GetDataAsBase64` function. A 64-bit integer representing a size was being cast to a 32-bit integer without proper bounds checking. This led to an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Integer overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow when converting a 64-bit size value to a 32-bit integer.
- **Heap buffer overflow:** The integer overflow results in a smaller-than-needed buffer being allocated and subsequently written to, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Memory corruption:** The overflow corrupts memory on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Potentially exploitable crash:** The memory corruption caused by the heap buffer overflow could lead to a crash.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** If carefully crafted, this overflow can allow for arbitrary code execution due to the memory corruption on the heap.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered by exploiting the structured clone mechanism, which is used to serialize data in web browsers.
- The specific function `nsStructuredCloneContainer::GetDataAsBase64` is the vulnerable function.
- A crafted JavaScript can trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript within the context of the vulnerable application (e.g., via a malicious website).
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the size parameters in order to cause an integer overflow when calling the structured clone API.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is within the `nsStructuredCloneContainer::GetDataAsBase64` function. Specifically, at line marked as `#1` in the provided code, an integer `v10` of type `unsigned __int64` is converted to a 32 bit integer and passed as the length parameter to `nsTSubstring_char_::SetLength`.
```
  if ( (unsigned __int8)nsTSubstring_char_::SetLength(&v20, (unsigned int)v10, &std::nothrow) ) #1
```
- The `v10` value comes from `v8[7]`, where v8 points to a structured clone object.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a large size and passing it through structured clone, triggering the integer overflow.
- The integer overflow causes `SetLength` to allocate a smaller buffer than needed.
- Subsequently, when the application copies data using `memcpy_0`, the size value is still based on the un-truncated 64 bit value causing the overflow.
- The crash occurs inside `memcpy` because the destination buffer is smaller than the amount of data to be copied.
- The crash analysis showed the overflow happening at `VCRUNTIME140!memcpy+0x22e`

**Additional notes:**

- The bug was discovered by `bo13oy of Cyber Kunlun Lab`.
- The vulnerability is assigned `sec-high` severity in Bugzilla.
- The fix involves checking for the overflow before calling SetLength, ensuring correct buffer allocation.
- The issue is present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird.
- Patches have been applied to Firefox 95, Firefox ESR 91.4, and Thunderbird 91.4.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that this conversion results in an **integer overflow**. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) accurately describes this scenario where a calculation produces a value outside the representable range, and the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. The technical details highlight that `v10` of type `unsigned __int64` is converted to a 32 bit integer, causing an overflow. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-190 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a Base level CWE. The integer overflow leads to a heap buffer overflow because `SetLength` allocates a smaller buffer than needed, which is written to using `memcpy`, leading to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of integer overflow and confirming details in the CVE reference)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that the **integer overflow results in a smaller-than-needed buffer being allocated and subsequently written to, leading to a heap buffer overflow**, and the application copies data using `memcpy_0`, the size value is still based on the un-truncated 64 bit value causing the overflow. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) accurately describes the condition where the product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates this is ALLOWED. The technical description notes: "Subsequently, when the application copies data using `memcpy_0`, the size value is still based on the un-truncated 64 bit value causing the overflow. The crash occurs inside `memcpy` because the destination buffer is smaller than the amount of data to be copied."

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE and a consequence of CWE-190. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.80 (High confidence because the integer overflow directly leads to an out-of-bounds write.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* While the primary issue is an out-of-bounds write, the description also suggests the possibility of reading data beyond the buffer boundaries. Although not explicitly stated, the over-writing may cause reading of the memory locations of other variables. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) describes the condition where the product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-125 indicates this is ALLOWED. However, the description focuses more on the write aspect of the overflow.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a base-level CWE. CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Lower confidence because the description focuses more on writing past the buffer than reading.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The root cause of the vulnerability is an **incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers**. CWE-681 (Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types) describes this scenario where converting from one data type to another produces unexpected values. The technical details confirm that `v10` of type `unsigned __int64` is converted to a 32 bit integer. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-681 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-681 is a Base level CWE. CWE-681 can precede CWE-190.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 (Lower confidence because CWE-190 more accurately represents the overflow condition.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.

- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Ensure that all protocols are strictly defined, such that all out-of-bounds behavior can be identified simply, and require strict conformance to the protocol.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


If possible, choose a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Use libraries or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences.


Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++). [REF-106]




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.



## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
