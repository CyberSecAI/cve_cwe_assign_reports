# Final Resolution for CVE-2022-22070

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.90 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The **routing address** is not validated, leading to an invalid memory access. |
| CWE-823 | Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: If the offset is out of range, memory corruption is possible |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: Consequence of the out-of-range offset |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The analysis focuses on the relationships between CWE-1285, CWE-823, and CWE-787 to build a vulnerability chain.

*   **Parent-child hierarchical relationships:** CWE-1285 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-823 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119.
*   **Chain relationships showing progression of vulnerability:** The chain starts with CWE-1285, as the lack of validation of the **routing address** leads to CWE-823 (out-of-range pointer offset), which in turn leads to CWE-787 (out-of-bounds write), resulting in memory corruption.
*   **Peer relationships that offered alternative classifications:** There were peer relationships with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow), but based on the description, the integer overflow is not as strong a candidate as CWE-1285.
*   **Abstraction levels:** All the selected CWEs (CWE-1285, CWE-823, and CWE-787) are at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of check of invalid routing address into APR Routing table** (CWE-1285). This leads to an out-of-range pointer offset (CWE-823), which results in an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), leading to memory corruption.
  - The **lack of check of invalid routing address into APR Routing table** is the **ROOTCAUSE**.
  - The consequences are **out-of-range pointer offset**, and subsequently **out-of-bounds write**.
  - There are no missing links in the chain.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis provides a sound starting point, but the criticism helps to refine the selection of the primary CWE and build a more complete vulnerability chain.

The assessment is based on the provided evidence, which is "Memory corruption in audio due to **lack of check of invalid routing address into APR Routing table** in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables".

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the sequence of events:
1.  Improper input validation (CWE-1285)
2.  Use of out-of-range pointer offset (CWE-823)
3.  Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they are all at the Base level of abstraction and accurately reflect the **root cause** and consequences of the vulnerability. The **root cause** is the **lack of check of invalid routing address**, which is well represented by CWE-1285. The out-of-range pointer offset and out-of-bounds write are consequences of this lack of validation.
