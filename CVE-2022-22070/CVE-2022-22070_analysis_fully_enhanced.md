# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-823 | Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-822 | Untrusted Pointer Dereference | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description highlights a **lack of check of invalid routing address into APR Routing table**, leading to memory corruption. This aligns well with CWE-823, "Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset," as the **lack of validation** could allow a pointer to access memory outside the intended range. The "Retriever Results" also support CWE-823 as a high-scoring candidate. The description also indicates a potential for an **out-of-bounds read**, which can result from using out-of-range pointer offsets. Because there is a **lack of check of invalid routing address**, it is possible that an **untrusted pointer** is dereferenced. Thus, CWE-822 "Untrusted Pointer Dereference" is a secondary candidate. Also, because there is **lack of check of invalid routing address**, CWE-1285 "Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input" is a valid candidate.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-823 is a Base level CWE, and is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It can also be a cause of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to a clear description of the **rootcause** and the alignment with the CWE definition and Retriever Results.)
