|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.85 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap-buffer overflow**". CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) directly addresses this type of vulnerability, where the overflow occurs in the heap portion of memory. The description indicates that OTFCC v0.10.4 is vulnerable to this issue, specifically at `/release-x64/otfccdump+0x61731f`. Given this direct statement, CWE-122 is the most appropriate and specific CWE. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) are related to buffer overflows, CWE-122 pinpoints the location of the overflow within the heap. The Retriever Results also list CWE-122, further supporting this choice. MITRE's mapping guidance for CWE-122 indicates its usage is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The hierarchical relationship confirms that CWE-122 is a more specific classification of a general out-of-bounds write, happening specifically in the heap.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to the explicit mention of "heap-buffer overflow" in the description and support from retriever results)
