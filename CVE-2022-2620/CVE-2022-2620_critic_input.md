## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-2620:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free in WebUI component of Chromium.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (UAF). This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could lead to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, implying that an attacker could trigger this vulnerability through network access, such as by crafting malicious web content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious content that can trigger the use-after-free vulnerability in the WebUI component of a vulnerable Chromium-based browser. This could involve hosting a malicious website or embedding the exploit within a webpage or other content displayed by a Chromium-based browser.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "high" severity.
- This vulnerability was reported by Nan Wang(@eternalsakura13) and Guang Gong of 360 Alpha Lab on 2022-06-17
- The fix is included in Chromium version 104.0.5112.101 and later.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the root cause. The description also notes "**heap corruption**" as a weakness due to "specific UI interactions" in "WebUI in Google Chrome on Chrome OS". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms "**Root cause of vulnerability: Use-after-free** in WebUI component of Chromium." CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction and directly aligns with the **root cause** described. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of higher-level Class CWEs. While other CWEs like CWE-366 (Race Condition Within a Thread) have decent scores, they are not directly supported by the evidence.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "use after free" and the CVE summary confirms it.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.



## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ChildOf -> CWE-662
ChildOf -> CWE-662

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use locking functionality. This is the recommended solution. Implement some form of locking mechanism around code which alters or reads persistent data in a multithreaded environment.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Create resource-locking validation checks. If no inherent locking mechanisms exist, use flags and signals to enforce your own blocking scheme when resources are being used by other threads of execution.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
