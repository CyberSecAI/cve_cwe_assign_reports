# Critic Input for CVE-2021-46023



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An Untrusted Pointer Dereference was discovered in function mrb_vm_exec in mruby before 3.1.0-rc. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **untrusted pointer dereference**
- **impact:** segmentation fault and application crash
- **product:** mruby
- **version:** before 3.1.0-rc
- **component:** mrb_vm_exec function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   An untrusted pointer dereference in the `mrb_vm_exec()` function within the mruby virtual machine. This occurs due to incorrect handling of arguments within the `mrb_get_args()` function, specifically when used in conjunction with methods like `Array#shift`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:**  The core vulnerability is that `mrb_vm_exec()` attempts to dereference a pointer that may be invalid or point to freed memory.
*   **Reentrancy Issues:** The `mrb_get_args()` function was not designed to be reentrant to the mruby VM, which leads to incorrect state when functions like `mrb_as_int()` or `mrb_as_float()` are called within `mrb_get_args()`.
*   **Incorrect Argument Handling:** The length of arguments was not being correctly updated after the call to `mrb_get_args()`, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Segmentation Fault:**  The primary impact is a segmentation fault, which causes the application using mruby to crash.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crash of the application leads to a denial of service.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, if memory corruption occurs it could potentially be used for more severe exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious mruby Script:** An attacker can craft a malicious mruby script that exploits the vulnerability. This script triggers the `Array#shift` or other affected methods with arguments that cause the problematic code to execute, leading to the pointer dereference and the crash.
*   **Input to mruby program:** Exploitation requires the processing of a specially crafted input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute mruby code:** An attacker must be able to execute mruby code on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable methods:** They need to know which specific methods (e.g. `Array#shift`, `Array#rotate`, `Array#rotate!`, `String#byteslice`) trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by methods that internally call `mrb_get_args()`, such as array manipulation methods and string manipulation methods.
*   The fixes involved adjusting the logic in `mrb_get_args()` to avoid reentrancy issues, correctly updating argument lengths and adjusting the stack frame after it enters the virtual machine.
*   The vulnerability was present in mruby version 3.0.0.
*   The issue was resolved by pull requests #5619 and #5620.

**Summary of Fixes:**

1.  **`mrb_ary_shift_m()` Fix:**
    *   The length of the arguments, `len`, is assigned *after* the call to `mrb_get_args()`, preventing the vulnerability.
2.  **`mrb_get_args()` Refactor:**
    *   The variables `argv` and `ci` are adjusted *after* `mrb_as_int()` and `mrb_as_float()`. This prevents a crash inside `mrb_get_args()`.
3.  **Stack Adjustment:**
    *   The stack is adjusted after entering the virtual machine to account for changes in context.
4.  **`mrb_as_float()` Fix:**
    *   The `mrb_as_float` function was modified to avoid calling `to_f` for generic objects and to only call it for `Rational` and `Complex` numbers.

The provided information provides a good overview of the vulnerability and its fixes.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**untrusted pointer dereference**" in the `mrb_vm_exec` function. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), which describes a scenario where a product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts it to a pointer, and dereferences it. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section also confirms this as the **root cause**. The impact, a segmentation fault and application crash, is a typical consequence of this type of weakness. The retriever results also rank CWE-822 as the top candidate with a high score.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other pointer-related CWEs like CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference), CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer), and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset) were considered, the explicit mention of an "untrusted" source makes CWE-822 the most specific and appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.


Programs may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.


If an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.


### Alternative Terms
Untrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of "out-of-range" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Description:** Select a programming language that is not susceptible to these issues.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is non-null before acting upon it.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.
- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference
- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference



## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).


There are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:


  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.

  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between "userland" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).

  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.

- **CVE-2010-2299:** labeled as a "type confusion" issue, also referred to as a "stale pointer." However, the bug ID says "contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly". The "handle" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).
- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.
