# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2020-26558

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-301 | Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves reflection of the public key and authentication evidence, which allows a MITM attacker to identify the Passkey. |
| CWE-290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate one of the paired devices. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.50 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: Passkey information is transmitted without proper protection allowing sniffing. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device during Passkey authentication which permits a MITM attacker to obtain the Passkey. This aligns well with CWE-301, Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol. The attacker can use a crafted series of responses to determine each bit of the randomly generated Passkey selected by the pairing initiator. The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can impersonate one of the paired devices to the other, potentially gaining access to authenticated services. CWE-290 is also considered because the **weakness** allows for authentication bypass by spoofing, as the attacker can impersonate a device after obtaining the passkey. CWE-319 is considered as a potential secondary weakness because the passkey information is transmitted in a way that allows it to be sniffed, effectively transmitting sensitive information in cleartext.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-301 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-290 is a Base level CWE. CWE-319 is a Base level CWE. There are no direct relationships between these CWEs in the graph data but they are related by the common theme of authentication and secure communication.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

- **CVE-2009-1048** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1048](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1048): VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-29280**: In TP-Link Wireless N Router WR840N an ARP poisoning attack can cause buffer overflow
- **CVE-2021-0232**: An authentication bypass vulnerability in the Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center may allow an attacker with specific information about the deployment to mimic an already registered Test Agent and access its configuration including associated inventory details. If the issue occurs, the affected Test Agent will not be able to connect to the Control Center. This issue affects Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance Control Center All versions prior to 2.35.6; 2.36 versions prior to 2.36.2.
- **CVE-2021-22779**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing vulnerability exists in EcoStruxure Control Expert (all versions prior to V15.0 SP1, including all versions of Unity Pro), EcoStruxure Control Expert V15.0 SP1, EcoStruxure Process Expert (all versions, including all versions of EcoStruxure Hybrid DCS), SCADAPack RemoteConnect for x70 (all versions), Modicon M580 CPU (all versions - part numbers BMEP* and BMEH*), Modicon M340 CPU (all versions - part numbers BMXP34*), that could cause unauthorized access in read and write mode to the controller by spoofing the Modbus communication between the engineering software and the controller.
- **CVE-2020-19003**: An issue in Gate One 1.2.0 allows attackers to bypass to the verification check done by the origins list and connect to Gate One instances used by hosts not on the origins list.
- **CVE-2020-22001**: HomeAutomation 3.3.2 suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability when spoofing client IP address using the X-Forwarded-For header with the local (loopback) IP address value allowing remote control of the smart home solution.
- **CVE-2021-22002**: VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager, allow the /cfg web app and diagnostic endpoints, on port 8443, to be accessed via port 443 using a custom host header. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 could tamper with host headers to facilitate access to the /cfg web app, in addition a malicious actor could access /cfg diagnostic endpoints without authentication.
- **CVE-2021-23008**: On version 15.1.x before 15.1.3, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.4, 12.1.x before 12.1.6, and all versions of 16.0.x and 11.6.x., BIG-IP APM AD (Active Directory) authentication can be bypassed via a spoofed AS-REP (Kerberos Authentication Service Response) response sent over a hijacked KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) connection or from an AD server compromised by an attacker. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.
- **CVE-2021-41753**: A denial-of-service attack in WPA2, and WPA3-SAE authentication methods in D-Link DIR-X1560, v1.04B04, and DIR-X6060, v1.11B04 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to disconnect a wireless client via sending specific spoofed SAE authentication frames.
