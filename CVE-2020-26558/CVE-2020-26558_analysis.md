# Analysis for CVE-2020-26558

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-301 | Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves reflection of the public key and authentication evidence, which allows a MITM attacker to identify the Passkey. |
| CWE-290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate one of the paired devices. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.50 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: Passkey information is transmitted without proper protection allowing sniffing. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device during Passkey authentication which permits a MITM attacker to obtain the Passkey. This aligns well with CWE-301, Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol. The attacker can use a crafted series of responses to determine each bit of the randomly generated Passkey selected by the pairing initiator. The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can impersonate one of the paired devices to the other, potentially gaining access to authenticated services. CWE-290 is also considered because the **weakness** allows for authentication bypass by spoofing, as the attacker can impersonate a device after obtaining the passkey. CWE-319 is considered as a potential secondary weakness because the passkey information is transmitted in a way that allows it to be sniffed, effectively transmitting sensitive information in cleartext.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-301 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-290 is a Base level CWE. CWE-319 is a Base level CWE. There are no direct relationships between these CWEs in the graph data but they are related by the common theme of authentication and secure communication.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
