# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-23857

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-836 | Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the **login routine allows authentication using the password hash** instead of the actual password. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-836, "Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating "**Use of password hash instead of password for authentication (CWE-836)**" as one of the weaknesses present. CWE-836 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that the Usage for CWE-836 is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While there are no direct relationships specified for CWE-836, the nature of using password hashes for authentication can be linked to other weaknesses. In this case, if the hashing algorithm used is weak, it can lead to CWE-916.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (The description explicitly describes the use of a password hash instead of a password which aligns very well with the definition of CWE-836.)

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-916, "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", is considered as a secondary candidate. The vulnerability description does not explicitly state that the password hashing algorithm is weak or insufficient. However, given that the system allows login with the hash directly, it raises concerns that the hashing mechanism might not be robust enough to prevent attacks like pre-computation or rainbow table attacks. While the primary issue is using the hash directly, the potential weakness of the hashing algorithm contributes to the overall vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-916 is a child of CWE-328 "Use of Weak Hash", which means that the hashing algorithm may not provide adequate security strength. CWE-916 is also parent of CWE-760 "Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt" and CWE-759 "Missing Salt", these relationships illustrate how weak password hashing algorithms may be vulnerable.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (There isn't direct evidence of a weak hash, but the use of password hashes directly for login suggests the potential for a weak or easily reversible hash.)



## Known Examples for CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1526** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1526](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1526): Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2006-1058** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1058](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1058): Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21253**: OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub. OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in the voting system.
- **CVE-2021-22774**: A CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could lead an attacker to get knowledge of charging station user account credentials using dictionary attacks techniques.
- **CVE-2021-38979**: IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager 3.0, 3.0.1, 4.0, and 4.1 uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the software does not also use a salt as part of the input. IBM X-Force ID: 212785.
- **CVE-2022-40295**:  The application was vulnerable to an authenticated information disclosure, allowing administrators to view unsalted user passwords, which could lead to the compromise of plaintext passwords via offline attacks. 


## Known Examples for CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash

- **CVE-2005-4900** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4900](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4900): SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.
- **CVE-2020-25685** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-25685](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-25685): DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.
- **CVE-2012-6707** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-6707](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-6707): blogging product uses MD5-based algorithm for passwords.
