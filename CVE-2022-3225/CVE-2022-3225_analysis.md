## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources**" in the Budibase application. This directly aligns with the CWE-913 description. While the provided commit information doesn't introduce a new vulnerability, the initial description points to this class of weakness. CWE-913 is a Class-level CWE, and while a more specific Base CWE would be preferred, the information available doesn't allow for a more granular classification. The MITRE mapping guidance suggests "Allowed-with-Review" for Class CWEs, acknowledging that more specific children might be more appropriate if further information was available. A candidate secondary CWE is CWE-915, which is a Base CWE and a child of CWE-913; however, there is insufficient detail to map that CWE with high confidence.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-913 is a Class CWE with potential Base-level children. In this case, no child is clearly indicated in the available evidence.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate confidence due to limited information; relies heavily on the vulnerability title.)
