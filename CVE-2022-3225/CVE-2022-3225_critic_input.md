## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources**" in the Budibase application. This directly aligns with the CWE-913 description. While the provided commit information doesn't introduce a new vulnerability, the initial description points to this class of weakness. CWE-913 is a Class-level CWE, and while a more specific Base CWE would be preferred, the information available doesn't allow for a more granular classification. The MITRE mapping guidance suggests "Allowed-with-Review" for Class CWEs, acknowledging that more specific children might be more appropriate if further information was available. A candidate secondary CWE is CWE-915, which is a Base CWE and a child of CWE-913; however, there is insufficient detail to map that CWE with high confidence.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-913 is a Class CWE with potential Base-level children. In this case, no child is clearly indicated in the available evidence.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Moderate confidence due to limited information; relies heavily on the vulnerability title.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

### Extended Description


If the object contains attributes that were only intended for internal use, then their unexpected modification could lead to a vulnerability.


This weakness is sometimes known by the language-specific mechanisms that make it possible, such as mass assignment, autobinding, or object injection.


### Alternative Terms
Mass Assignment: "Mass assignment" is the name of a feature in Ruby on Rails that allows simultaneous modification of multiple object attributes.
AutoBinding: The "Autobinding" term is used in frameworks such as Spring MVC and ASP.NET MVC.
PHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term for attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function, but it is also used for CWE-502.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-913
PeerOf -> CWE-502
ParentOf -> CWE-1321

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

If available, use features of the language or framework that allow specification of allowlists of attributes or fields that are allowed to be modified. If possible, prefer allowlists over denylists.


For applications written with Ruby on Rails, use the attr_accessible (allowlist) or attr_protected (denylist) macros in each class that may be used in mass assignment.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** If available, use the signing/sealing features of the programming language to assure that deserialized data has not been tainted. For example, a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) could be used to ensure that data has not been modified.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** For any externally-influenced input, check the input against an allowlist of internal object attributes or fields that are allowed to be modified.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-3283:** Application for using LLMs allows modification of a sensitive variable using mass assignment.
- **CVE-2012-2054:** Mass assignment allows modification of arbitrary attributes using modified URL.
- **CVE-2012-2055:** Source version control product allows modification of trusted key using mass assignment.



## CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly restrict reading from or writing to dynamically-managed code resources such as variables, objects, classes, attributes, functions, or executable instructions or statements.

### Extended Description
Many languages offer powerful features that allow the programmer to dynamically create or modify existing code, or resources used by code such as variables and objects. While these features can offer significant flexibility and reduce development time, they can be extremely dangerous if attackers can directly influence these code resources in unexpected ways.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664
ParentOf -> CWE-1321
ParentOf -> CWE-470
ParentOf -> CWE-502
ParentOf -> CWE-914
ParentOf -> CWE-915
ParentOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** For any externally-influenced input, check the input against an allowlist of acceptable values.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation, Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Refactoring
- **Description:** Refactor the code so that it does not need to be dynamically managed.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2054:** Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.
- **CVE-2018-1000613:** Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key
- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.
