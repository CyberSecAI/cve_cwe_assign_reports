# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-1769

## Vulnerability Description
Buffer Over-read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4974.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer Over-read**
- **product:** vim/vim
- **version:** prior to 8.2.4974

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `scriptfile.c` file of Vim. This occurs when handling the ":so" (source) command. Specifically, it involves an improper calculation of the length of the text being read from the source file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Over-read:** The code attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service, though the exact mechanisms are not specified in these documents. A buffer over-read could result in a crash or other unexpected behavior.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, buffer over-reads can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if the read data influences subsequent operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the ":so" command in Vim, meaning that the attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted source file to vim. This could be done through various attack vectors:
    - **Local Attack:** A malicious user can create a file with the malicious content and source it.
    - **Remote Attack:** In some situations, users might unknowingly source files from a remote location. This is less common in modern vim configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a malicious source file:** An attacker must be able to supply a crafted file to be sourced using the `:so` command.
- **User interaction (potentially):**  The user needs to open the file with vim and use the `:so` command. In some cases, users may unintentionally source files automatically through a malicious .vimrc configuration file or similar.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided data shows that the vulnerability affects Vim, gVim, and vim-core.
- Patches for this issue have been included in version 8.2.4975 of vim according to Fedora and version 9.0.0060 for Gentoo.
- Apple indicates that they have patched the vulnerability in macOS Ventura 13.
- The vulnerability is considered "low severity" by Gentoo, and "remote" exploitable.
- The vulnerability is fixed in patch 8.2.4974 according to the Github commit referenced.

The information from the various sources confirms that CVE-2022-1769 is a buffer over-read in Vim's `scriptfile.c` related to the `:so` command. The root cause is improper length calculation, potentially leading to a DoS and potentially remote code execution, it requires the ability to supply a malicious source file, and has been patched by multiple vendors. The Gentoo advisory also mentions the impact could result in a denial of service.
