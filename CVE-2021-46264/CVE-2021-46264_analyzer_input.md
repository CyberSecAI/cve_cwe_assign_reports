## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `/goform/setQos` page of Tenda Router AC11. Specifically, the vulnerability resides within the `onlineList` module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The program reads user-supplied input from the `onlineList` parameter.
- This input is passed to the function `sub_800D23EC`.
- Inside this function, the `strncpy` function is used to copy the user input into a fixed-size memory buffer of 260 bytes.
- The lack of proper size validation of the user input before using `strncpy` leads to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by overflowing the buffer, causing the device to crash.
- With a carefully crafted payload, Remote Code Execution (RCE) is also possible, allowing the attacker to gain control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/setQos` page.
- The malicious payload is included within the `onlineList` parameter of this POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint on the Tenda router.
- It's implied that the attacker would have network access to the device, either locally or remotely (depending on router configuration).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable version mentioned is Tenda Router AC11 with firmware version AC11_V02.03.01.104_CN.
- The vulnerability was reported on 2022-01-09 and assigned CVE ID CVE-2021-46264 on 2022-02-16 and CNVD-2022-08888 on 2022-02-07.
