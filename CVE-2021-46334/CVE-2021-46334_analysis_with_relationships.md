|---------|--------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow    | 0.95       | Variant               | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a **stack buffer overflow** in the `__interceptor_strcat` function of the Moddable SDK. The analysis of the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the root cause is a **stack-based buffer overflow**. This perfectly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-121 is chosen because the overflow occurs on the stack. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions that the code does not properly check the length of the combined strings before the concatenation, which is relevant to CWE-120.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119, indicating a more specific type of buffer overflow. CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) is also relevant because the concatenation function `strcat` copies data without checking the buffer size. However, since the overflow occurs specifically on the stack, CWE-121 is the primary CWE. CWE-120 could be considered as a contributing factor, because the size of input is not validated before copying data to a buffer on the stack.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of **stack buffer overflow** and detailed root cause analysis.)
