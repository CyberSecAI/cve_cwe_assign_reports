## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states that the root cause is an **uncaught exception**. This directly aligns with CWE-248 (Uncaught Exception), which describes a scenario where an exception is thrown from a function but not caught. The impact of this **uncaught exception** is a denial of service, which further supports the identification of CWE-248 as the primary weakness. The 'Retriever Results' also lists CWE-248 with the highest score and is at the Base level of abstraction, confirming this selection. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-248 indicates this is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-248 does not have direct parent-child relationships. However, it falls under the broader category of exception handling issues. Although CWE-755 (Exception Handling Issues) is listed in similar CVE descriptions and retriever results, CWE-248 is more specific as it highlights the **uncaught** nature of the exception. The relationship analysis considered CWE-755, but the direct mention of the **uncaught exception** led to prioritizing CWE-248."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-248: Uncaught Exception
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-41151** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151): SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked for writing but the server tries to send an error
- **CVE-2023-21087** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-21087](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-21087): Java code in a smartphone OS can encounter a "boot loop" due to an uncaught exception
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0005**: Uncaught exception in firmware for Intel(R) Ethernet Adapters 800 Series Controllers and associated adapters before version 1.5.3.0 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.
- **CVE-2021-0007**: Uncaught exception in firmware for Intel(R) Ethernet Adapters 800 Series Controllers and associated adapters before version 1.5.1.0 may allow a privileged attacker to potentially enable denial of service via local access.
- **CVE-2021-39187**: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist.
- **CVE-2020-10604**: In OSIsoft PI System multiple products and versions, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could crash PI Network Manager service through specially crafted requests. This can result in blocking connections and queries to PI Data Archive.
- **CVE-2020-13410**: An issue was discovered in MoscaJS Aedes 0.42.0. lib/write.js does not properly consider exceptions during the writing of an invalid packet to a stream.
- **CVE-2020-15701**: An unhandled exception in check_ignored() in apport/report.py can be exploited by a local attacker to cause a denial of service. If the mtime attribute is a string value in apport-ignore.xml, it will trigger an unhandled exception, resulting in a crash. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.16, 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.6.
- **CVE-2020-19473**: An issue has been found in function DCTStream::decodeImage in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to an uncaught floating point exception.
- **CVE-2020-27121**: A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the Cisco XCP Authentication Service on an affected device to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted client login request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition for new login attempts. Users who are authenticated at the time of the attack would not be affected. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
