# Resolution Input for CVE-2021-0590

## Vulnerability Description
In sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast of NetworkMonitor.java, there is a possible way for a privileged app to receive WiFi BSSID and SSID without location permissions due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1 Android-9Android ID A-175213041

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.75 | Pillar | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.65 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-201 | Information Exposure Through Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description highlights a **missing permission check** in `sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast` of `NetworkMonitor.java`. This allows a privileged app to receive WiFi BSSID and SSID without location permissions. This directly relates to **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) because access to sensitive information (WiFi BSSID and SSID) is not correctly restricted, and a **missing authorization** (CWE-862) check is the root cause. This also leads to **Information Exposure** (CWE-201) as the data is transmitted without proper restrictions. However, CWE-284 is a high-level pillar, and CWE-862 is a class level weakness. The root cause is more accurately represented by CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-284 is a Pillar, with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as children. In this case, the **missing permission check** maps directly to CWE-862. CWE-862 is related to CWE-201 (Information Exposure Through Sent Data) as the lack of authorization leads to the transmission of sensitive data. MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-862 with review, which is appropriate since it is a class-level weakness."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (Medium evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, focusing on the **missing permission check**.)

## Criticism
Okay, here's a review of the CWE analysis provided, taking into account the full CWE specifications:

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally good and identifies relevant CWEs. The primary CWE, CWE-284, is correctly identified as being related to the problem, however, the final analysis correctly chooses CWE-862 as the more correct mapping. The inclusion of CWE-201 highlights the impact of the authorization failure. The confidence scoring is reasonable. The analysis also provides a sound explanation of the relationships between the chosen CWEs.

**Detailed Review:**

1.  **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:**

    *   **Assessment:** The initial selection of CWE-284 is understandable, as it broadly covers the issue. However, as the analysis itself points out, it is a high-level, Pillar CWE. Per the *Mapping Guidance* for CWE-284, it's *Discouraged* because it's too abstract. The recommendation is to use more specific descendants.
    *   **Critique:** The analysis correctly identifies that a more specific CWE is needed.  It correctly points out that CWE-862 and CWE-863 are children of CWE-284 and more appropriate.
    *   **Mitigations:** The mitigations for CWE-284 are very general ("Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges"). This reinforces the need to choose a more specific CWE for which more actionable mitigations can be recommended.

2.  **CWE-862: Missing Authorization:**

    *   **Assessment:**  This is the most accurate primary mapping based on the information provided, as the vulnerability stems from the *absence* of a necessary permission check.  The description of CWE-862 perfectly aligns: "The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action."  The "missing permission check" in the vulnerability description directly supports this mapping.
    *   **Critique:** The usage is *Allowed-with-Review*, pointing out that a more specific child may be available. However, there isn't a more specific child of CWE-862 that better describes the core issue. The permission check is what's missing, so `Missing Authorization` directly corresponds with the rootcause. The `Confidence` of 0.65 is a little low, and should be higher (0.75-0.8).
    *   **Mitigations:** The suggested mitigations for CWE-862 are helpful:  "Divide the product into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Reduce the attack surface by carefully mapping roles with data and functionality." This is directly applicable:  Ensure that the `sendNetworkConditionsBroadcast` function explicitly checks for the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission (or another appropriate permission) before allowing the broadcast to occur.

3.  **CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data:**

    *   **Assessment:** The inclusion of CWE-201 as a secondary CWE is appropriate.  The *Description* of CWE-201 states "The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor." This accurately describes the impact of the missing authorization.
    *   **Critique:** Good secondary mapping to cover impact. The examples provided with the full CWE specifications further reinforce its relevance.  The confidence score of 0.5 is a little too low and should be 0.6.
    *   **Mitigations:** The potential mitigations for CWE-201 are also relevant. "Specify which data in the software should be regarded as sensitive" and "Ensure that any possibly sensitive data specified in the requirements is verified with designers to ensure that it is either a calculated risk or mitigated elsewhere." These emphasize the importance of defining what data requires protection and implementing appropriate controls.

4.  **Retriever Results Assessment**
    *   **CWE-941, CWE-1021, CWE-223, CWE-927, CWE-248, CWE-203, CWE-514, CWE-732, CWE-909:**
        *   These are incorrectly mapped. The vulnerability is an access control vulnerability, not related to UI rendering, communication channels, unhandled exceptions, missing information, covert channels, incorrect permission assignments, or missing resource initialization. All retrievers would need to be re-trained.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

*   **Increase Confidence in CWE-862:** Given the direct correspondence between the vulnerability description ("missing permission check") and CWE-862, increase the confidence score.
*   **Refine Explanation of CWE-201's Role:** While CWE-201 is a good secondary mapping, slightly strengthen the explanation of *how* the missing authorization leads to information exposure.  Emphasize that the *unauthorized* transmission of SSID and BSSID is the core problem that CWE-201 captures.
*   **Consider Other Related CWEs (Optional):** While not essential, you could consider other more-specific CWEs *related* to permission checks, *if* the information is available to be more specific. It depends on the level of detail available about the specific Android permission system being used.
*   **Add Android Specific Mitigations:** While the CWE mitigations are good, adding Android-specific mitigations would improve the analysis. For example, in the mitigation section for CWE-862, you could explicitly mention: "Use the `checkCallingPermission()` or `enforceCallingPermission()` methods in Android to verify that the calling application has the required permission before broadcasting the intent."
*   **Improve Retriever Results:** The retriever results are poor. The training data for the retrievers needs to be improved.

**Revised Summary Table:**

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.75 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-201 | Information Exposure Through Sent Data | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

By implementing these suggestions, the analysis becomes even more robust and provides more actionable insights.
