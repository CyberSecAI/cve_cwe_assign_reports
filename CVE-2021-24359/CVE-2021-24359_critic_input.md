## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder" plugin, specifically an arbitrary password reset email sending issue (CVE-2021-24359).

**Root cause:**
The plugin's password reset functionality does not properly verify that the user requesting the reset is indeed the legitimate owner of the account. This allows an attacker to trigger password reset emails for any user by using the `theplus_ajax_forgot_password_ajax` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Improper access control: The plugin fails to adequately check the legitimacy of password reset requests.
- Lack of user verification: The password reset process does not include any mechanism to ensure that the request is coming from the legitimate user.
- Insecure handling of user input: The plugin accepts arbitrary user input (email subject and message) without proper sanitization when sending password reset emails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary password reset email: An attacker can send a password reset email to any registered user on the WordPress site.
- Account takeover: By chaining this vulnerability with an open redirect, an attacker can craft a password reset link in the email that redirects the victim to a malicious site after they click it. The attacker can then use the key obtained through the crafted link to complete the password reset process and take over the victim's account.
- Phishing: The attacker can include malicious links within the password reset email to potentially trick the user into providing credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network request: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the WordPress `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- Lack of CSRF protection: The plugin relies on a nonce which can be obtained from the page, making it possible to exploit this vulnerability without any special user privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a web browser or a tool that can send HTTP POST requests.
- The attacker also needs to be able to obtain the "tp\_user\_lost\_password\_nonce", which is present in the HTML source of any page where the vulnerable widget is placed.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site.
- The "WP Login & Register" widget must be activated and present on a page of the WordPress site.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description indicates that the Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.11 **did not properly check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user**. This aligns with CWE-620 [When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication]. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the **root cause** is that the plugin's password reset functionality **does not properly verify** that the user requesting the reset is indeed the legitimate owner of the account. CWE-620 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-620 does not have any direct relationships. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a related CWE as the password reset functionality is a critical function and lacks proper authentication. However, CWE-620 is more specific to password changes, making it the primary CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is a candidate because the plugin **did not properly check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user**, this can be interpreted as a missing authentication step for a critical function (password reset). The vulnerability description also highlights the impact of sending an arbitrary reset password email to a registered user. Although CWE-620 is a more specific match, CWE-306 could be considered as a secondary contributing factor. CWE-306 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). While relevant, the specificity of CWE-620 makes it a better primary match."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Supporting evidence from the CVE description)

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).



## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

### Extended Description
This could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** When prompting for a password change, force the user to provide the original password in addition to the new password.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Do not use "forgotten password" functionality. But if you must, ensure that you are only providing information to the actual user, e.g. by using an email address or challenge question that the legitimate user already provided in the past; do not allow the current user to change this identity information until the correct password has been provided.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.
- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.



## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ParentOf -> CWE-288

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.
