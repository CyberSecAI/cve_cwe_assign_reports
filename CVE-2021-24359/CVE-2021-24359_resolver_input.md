# Resolution Input for CVE-2021-24359

## Vulnerability Description
The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.11 did not properly check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user, allowing an attacker to send an arbitrary reset password email to a registered user on behalf of the WordPress site. Such issue could be chained with an open redirect (CVE-2021-24358) in version below 4.1.10, to include a crafted password reset link in the email, which would lead to an account takeover.

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-620 | Unverified Password Change | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description indicates that the Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.11 **did not properly check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user**. This aligns with CWE-620 [When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication]. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the **root cause** is that the plugin's password reset functionality **does not properly verify** that the user requesting the reset is indeed the legitimate owner of the account. CWE-620 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-620 does not have any direct relationships. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a related CWE as the password reset functionality is a critical function and lacks proper authentication. However, CWE-620 is more specific to password changes, making it the primary CWE."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is a candidate because the plugin **did not properly check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user**, this can be interpreted as a missing authentication step for a critical function (password reset). The vulnerability description also highlights the impact of sending an arbitrary reset password email to a registered user. Although CWE-620 is a more specific match, CWE-306 could be considered as a secondary contributing factor. CWE-306 is a Base level CWE and is ALLOWED."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). While relevant, the specificity of CWE-620 makes it a better primary match."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Supporting evidence from the CVE description)

## Criticism
Okay, here's a review of the provided analysis, incorporating the full CWE specifications.

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally well-reasoned and identifies relevant CWEs. The choice of CWE-620 as the primary CWE is appropriate, given the specific nature of the vulnerability. The secondary CWE-306 is also a reasonable consideration. The confidence scores are also appropriate based on the information.

**Detailed Review:**

**1. CWE-620: Unverified Password Change (Primary)**

*   **Assessment:** Excellent choice. This CWE precisely captures the core issue: the lack of verification during the password reset process.
*   **Justification:** The explanation accurately reflects the CWE definition. The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly point to a password reset mechanism that doesn't validate the user's identity. The analysis also correctly notes that CWE-620 is a Base-level CWE and therefore appropriate.
*   **Relationship Analysis:** The analysis correctly states that CWE-306 is related, but CWE-620 is more specific.
*   **Mitigation Relevance:** The provided mitigations for CWE-620 are directly applicable. Requiring the original password or using alternative authentication methods (security questions, email validation) are standard defenses against this vulnerability. The suggestion against using 'forgotten password' functionality is also good to highlight the risk. The mitigation of using email addresses or challenge questions that the legitimate user already provided in the past is very relevant.
*   **Confidence:** Justified at 0.95.  The evidence from both the vulnerability description and CVE details strongly supports this CWE.

**2. CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (Secondary)**

*   **Assessment:** A valid secondary consideration. While CWE-620 is more precise, CWE-306 highlights the broader lack of authentication for a critical function (password reset).
*   **Justification:** The explanation correctly points out that the lack of proper checking can be viewed as missing authentication.
*   **Relationship Analysis:**  The analysis is correct in stating that CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).
*   **Mitigation Relevance:** The provided mitigations for CWE-306 are generally applicable, though less specific than those for CWE-620.  The emphasis on centralized authentication and protecting all communication channels is good advice. Specifically Mitigation 1 that discusses dividing the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas is especially relevant.
*   **Confidence:** The confidence level of 0.75 is appropriate. While relevant, CWE-306 is a more general categorization of the problem.

**Additional CWE Considerations & Retriever Results Critique:**

*   **CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter:** The retriever suggested this, and it has some relevance, especially regarding the `tp_user_lost_password_nonce`. If the nonce can be manipulated, or if its absence isn't properly handled, it could contribute to the bypass. This could be considered a tertiary CWE if the nonce is not adequately protected. However, focusing on the nonce might obscure the primary issue, which is the lack of verification of the *user* making the request, regardless of the nonce.
*   **CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key:** This is less relevant as the primary issue isn't bypassing authorization to access *existing* data, but rather triggering an action (password reset) on another user's account.
*   **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'):** Not very relevant in this case. It's more about missing verification than directly accessing restricted resources.
*   **CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The description mentions the nonce (`tp_user_lost_password_nonce`) which can be obtained from the page. If the nonce is not properly validated or if CSRF protection is generally weak, it *could* be a contributing factor. However, the core vulnerability exists even without CSRF protection.  It's more of an *enabling factor* rather than a direct cause.
*   **CWE-862: Missing Authorization:** This is similar to CWE-306 but focuses more on *authorization* than *authentication*. In this case, authentication is the bigger issue, so 306 is a better fit.
*   **CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel:** Not really applicable here. There isn't an alternate, unauthenticated path. The main path itself lacks sufficient authentication.
*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**: This was listed as #7 in Retriever results. The description notes "The plugin accepts arbitrary user input (email subject and message) without proper sanitization when sending password reset emails." If the password reset email allows for HTML or script insertion, and the input is not properly sanitized, then CWE-79 *could* be applicable.
*   **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password**: Irrelevant in this case since its about password *reset* functionality.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Minor Enhancement:** Briefly acknowledge the potential relevance of CWE-472 and CWE-352 in the analysis, especially if the nonce is easily obtainable and predictable or if CSRF protection is generally weak.
2.  **Consider adding CWE-79:** If the password reset email is allowing for unescaped HTML or script insertion, then CWE-79 is a relevant secondary consideration.
3.  **Emphasize Mitigation:**  In the CWE-620 discussion, more strongly emphasize the email validation mitigation. Suggesting best practices for password recovery processes can add practical value.

In summary, the analysis is strong and well-supported by the evidence. The suggestions above provide some refinements to make the assessment more comprehensive.

Consider both the direct matches and the relationships between CWEs
when making your final determination.
