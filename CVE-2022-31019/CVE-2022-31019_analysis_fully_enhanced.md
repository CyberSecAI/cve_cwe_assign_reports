# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-674 | Improper Control of Recursion Depth | 0.70 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the server crashes due to a **stack overflow** caused by **unbounded stack growth** when parsing deeply nested URL-encoded form data. The attacker crafts a request body with excessive nesting, leading to the overflow. This aligns directly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of buffer overflow that occurs on the stack. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions CWE-121. Furthermore, CWE-674 (Improper Control of Recursion Depth) is also applicable, because the root cause involves uncontrolled recursion leading to excessive resource consumption (stack space). The fix involves adding a `maxRecursionDepth` limit, which directly addresses the improper control of recursion.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-674 does not have direct relationships, but it is a class level CWE and could have base-level children. CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) are also related to resource exhaustion, but are less applicable because the stack overflow is due to uncontrolled recursion, rather than simply allocating too much memory or too many resources. CWE-674 CanPrecede CWE-121, where the improper control of recursion depth causes a stack-based buffer overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of stack overflow and unbounded stack growth in the description and CVE reference, as well as the addition of recursion depth limit as a fix.)
