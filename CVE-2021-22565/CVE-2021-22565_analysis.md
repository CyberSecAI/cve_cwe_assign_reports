## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly point to **insufficient granularity of access control** as the root cause. An attacker with permission to expire verification codes could **expire codes from other realms** because the system did not properly validate if the user/API key had authorization to expire that *specific* code. This aligns directly with CWE-1220, "Insufficient Granularity of Access Control," which describes a scenario where access controls lack the necessary precision, allowing unauthorized access.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships mentioned for CWE-1220 in the provided information. However, the description of CWE-1220 aligns directly with the vulnerability, confirming its relevance.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
