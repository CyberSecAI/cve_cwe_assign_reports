## Vulnerability Description
An attacker could prematurely expire a verification code, making it unusable by the patient, making the patient unable to upload their TEKs to generate exposure notifications. We recommend upgrading the Exposure Notification server to V1.1.2 or greater.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** prematurely expire verification code
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Exposure Notification server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22565

**Root Cause:** Insufficient access control when expiring verification codes.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control:** The system allowed users or API keys with the permission to expire verification codes to potentially expire codes belonging to other realms. This was due to the system not properly validating if the user/API key had the authorization to expire the specific code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Code Expiration:** An attacker with the ability to expire verification codes could expire codes from other realms if they could guess the UUID of the target code. This could disrupt the intended functionality of the system by rendering valid codes unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Guessing UUIDs:** The attacker would need to guess the 64-bit UUID of a verification code belonging to a realm they don't have access to but have the general permission to expire codes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Permissions to Expire Codes:** The attacker must have user or API key access with the permission to expire verification codes.
*   **Ability to guess UUIDs:**  The attacker needs the capability to guess a valid 64 bit UUID.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to versions of the `exposure-notifications-verification-server` prior to 1.1.2.
*   The issue was addressed in version 1.1.2 and later.
*   Verification codes have a short lifespan, reducing the window of opportunity for exploitation.
*   There are no indications this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.
* The vulnerability has been classified as Moderate severity.
* The associated CWE is CWE-1220 which is "Insufficient Granularity of Access Control".

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly point to **insufficient granularity of access control** as the root cause. An attacker with permission to expire verification codes could **expire codes from other realms** because the system did not properly validate if the user/API key had authorization to expire that *specific* code. This aligns directly with CWE-1220, "Insufficient Granularity of Access Control," which describes a scenario where access controls lack the necessary precision, allowing unauthorized access.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* There are no direct relationships mentioned for CWE-1220 in the provided information. However, the description of CWE-1220 aligns directly with the vulnerability, confirming its relevance.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

### Extended Description


Integrated circuits and hardware engines can expose accesses to assets (device configuration, keys, etc.) to trusted firmware or a software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader). This access is typically access-controlled. Upon a power reset, the hardware or system usually starts with default values in registers, and the trusted firmware (Boot firmware) configures the necessary access-control protection.


A common weakness that can exist in such protection schemes is that access controls or policies are not granular enough. This condition allows agents beyond trusted agents to access assets and could lead to a loss of functionality or the ability to set up the device securely. This further results in security risks from leaked, sensitive, key material to modification of device configuration.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ParentOf -> CWE-1222

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation, Testing
- **Effectiveness:** High
- **Description:** 

  - Access-control-policy protections must be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses.

  - Access-control-policy definition and programming flow must be tested in pre-silicon, post-silicon testing.






### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2021-36934:** An operating system has an overly permission Access Control List onsome system files, including those related to user passwords
