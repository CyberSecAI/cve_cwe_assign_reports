- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a "**use after free**" in Google Chrome, which directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The **root cause** is explicitly stated as "Use after free" in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The impact is heap corruption, stemming from the **weakness**. The CWE-416 description states: "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed." This matches the vulnerability description precisely. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.
