# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-34435

## Vulnerability Description
In Eclipse Theia 0.3.9 to 1.8.1, the mini-browser extension allows a user to preview HTML files in an iframe inside the IDE. But with the way it is made it is possible for a previewed HTML file to trigger an RCE. This exploit only happens if a user previews a malicious file..

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34435:

**Verification:**

1. The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-34435" in the title of the bug report from bugs.eclipse.org, confirming the relevance to the specified CVE.
2. The description of the vulnerability in the bug report aligns with the information provided in the github content related to pull request 8759, specifically concerning the "mini-browser" extension in Theia.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way the Theia "mini-browser" extension handles HTML previews. It uses an iframe with `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` sandbox attributes, serving the HTML file from the same origin as the Theia backend. This allows a malicious HTML file to bypass CORS restrictions and directly connect to Theia's backend WebSocket endpoint.
    *   The core issue is the lack of proper WebSocket origin validation in the Theia backend, which is addressed by the fix introduced in the pull request 8759.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure iframe sandboxing:** The use of `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` on iframes serving user-provided HTML opens the door for XSS and RCE if the HTML is malicious.
    *   **Lack of WebSocket Origin Validation:** The Theia backend does not properly validate the origin of WebSocket upgrade requests, allowing connections from unauthorized origins.
    *   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The vulnerability exploits the same-origin policy and the ability for an iframe to execute Javascript to connect to the parent's websocket and send commands.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A malicious HTML file, when previewed by a user, can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Theia backend. This was demonstrated by the PoC HTML file creating a directory, and the vscode extension listing recent workspaces.
    *   **Data Access:** Through the WebSocket connection, an attacker can access and manipulate data and services exposed by the Theia backend, potentially leading to further unauthorized actions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious HTML File:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript code designed to exploit the vulnerability. This file needs to be previewed using Theia's mini-browser extension.
    *   **WebSocket Connection Hijacking**: The attack utilizes a websocket connection from the exploited iframe with the backend.
    *   **VSCode Extension**: It is also possible to exploit the vulnerability with a malicious VSCode extension as shown in the attached POC.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to get the victim to preview a malicious HTML file using Theia's mini-browser.
    *   The attacker does not require any credentials.
    *   The attacker does not require any special access or permissions within the Theia environment.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability impacts versions 0.3.9 to 1.8.1 of Theia, and is fixed in version 1.9.0.
*   The fix addresses the issue by implementing WebSocket origin validation and by serving mini-browser content from a separate origin.
*   The pull request 8759 introduces a `THEIA_HOSTS` environment variable for specifying allowed hosts for WebSocket upgrades.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable in the Electron version of Theia because it does not need to handle arbitrary origins.
*   The github content discusses using a Content Security Policy (CSP) but ultimately was rejected in favor of the implemented fix.

In summary, CVE-2021-34435 is a critical vulnerability that allows for RCE via a malicious HTML file due to insecure iframe sandboxing and a lack of WebSocket origin validation in the Theia "mini-browser" extension. The vulnerability was addressed in Theia 1.9.0 by serving mini-browser content from a separate origin and implementing origin validation for websocket requests.
