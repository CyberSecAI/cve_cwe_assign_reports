# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-34549

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-328 | Use of Weak Hash | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability stems from mishandling hashing, making it vulnerable to HashDoS attacks due to the use of an unsafe hash function. |
| CWE-407 | Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: The impact of the vulnerability is algorithm inefficiency, which can lead to denial of service. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description highlights a **mishandling of hashing** that leads to algorithm inefficiency. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `chanid_circid_entry_hash()` function employs an unsafe hash function, making it vulnerable to HashDoS attacks. This aligns with CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash), which describes the use of an algorithm that produces a digest that does not meet security expectations for a hash function. The provided MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-328 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED, making it a suitable choice. Additionally, the **impact** of the vulnerability, algorithm inefficiency, can be related to CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity), though this is less direct and more of a consequence of the weak hash. CWE-328 is chosen as the primary CWE due to its direct connection to the **root cause**, while CWE-407 is a secondary factor related to the **impact**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-328 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred according to the MITRE mapping guidance. It is also related to CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). CWE-407 is a Class-level CWE, and while less specific, it represents the inefficiency caused by the weak hashing algorithm.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to the clear technical description and CVE reference materials supporting the mapping to CWE-328, with CWE-407 as a relevant secondary factor).

## Known Examples for CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1526** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1526](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1526): Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2006-1058** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1058](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1058): Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2008-4905** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4905](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4905): Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.
- **CVE-2002-1657** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1657](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1657): Database server uses the username for a salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.
- **CVE-2001-0967** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0967](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0967): Server uses a constant salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.
- **CVE-2005-0408** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0408](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0408): chain: product generates predictable MD5 hashes using a constant value combined with username, allowing authentication bypass.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-25754**: An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.
- **CVE-2021-22741**: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort vulnerability exists in ClearSCADA (all versions), EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2019 (all versions), and EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2020 (V83.7742.1 and prior), which could cause the revealing of account credentials when server database files are available. Exposure of these files to an attacker can make the system vulnerable to password decryption attacks. Note that “.sde” configuration export files do not contain user account password hashes.
- **CVE-2021-32519**: Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort vulnerability in QSAN Storage Manager, XEVO, SANOS allows remote attackers to recover the plain-text password by brute-forcing the MD5 hash. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.2, QSAN XEVO v2.1.0, and QSAN SANOS v2.1.0.
- **CVE-2021-33003**: Delta Electronics DIAEnergie Version 1.7.5 and prior may allow an attacker to retrieve passwords in cleartext due to a weak hashing algorithm.
