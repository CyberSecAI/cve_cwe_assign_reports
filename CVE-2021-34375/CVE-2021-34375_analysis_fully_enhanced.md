# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-344 | Use of Invariant Value in Dynamically Changing Context | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **stack-based buffer overflow**. This aligns directly with CWE-121, which is a Variant-level CWE specifically for stack-based buffer overflows. The description also states the **root cause** is that the **stack cookie was not randomized**. This means a constant or predictable value is used where a dynamically generated one is needed, which matches the description of CWE-344 (Use of Invariant Value in Dynamically Changing Context). CWE-344 is a contributing factor, as the lack of stack cookie randomization makes the stack-based buffer overflow easier to exploit. The presence of a **stack-based buffer overflow** is the more direct and impactful weakness; therefore, CWE-121 is the primary weakness, and CWE-344 is a secondary weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates that it is ALLOWED for stack-based buffer overflows, and CWE-344 is ALLOWED as well.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-344 is related to CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) as the lack of randomization of the stack cookie implies the use of a predictable or constant value.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct mention of stack-based buffer overflow and the explicit root cause of lack of stack cookie randomization)
