# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-34375

## Vulnerability Description
Trusty contains a vulnerability in all trusted applications (TAs) where the **stack cookie was not randomized**, which might result in **stack-based buffer overflow**, leading to denial of service, escalation of privileges, and information disclosure.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **stack cookie was not randomized**
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** ['denial of service', 'escalation of privileges', 'information disclosure']
- **product:** Trusty
- **component:** all trusted applications (TAs)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The stack cookie was not randomized in all trusted applications (TAs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of stack cookie randomization. This can lead to stack-based buffer overflows.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Denial of service, escalation of privileges, and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Attacker needs local access with high privileges and must induce user interaction.
