# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                        | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :------- | :------------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.00      | Base                  | Allowed                         | Root cause of the vulnerability  |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.00
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Out-of-bounds Read**" as the **rootcause**. The description also mentions that the program "reads data past the end of the intended buffer," which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read]. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating "A 4-byte out-of-bounds read in the MSP430 disassembler" and "the code attempts to read 2 bytes for a jump address when the buffer has less than 4 bytes." The retriever results also show CWE-125 as a high-scoring candidate. Therefore, CWE-125 is the most appropriate mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read] is a Base level CWE. The retriever results also included CWE-126 [Buffer Over-read], which is a Variant of CWE-125, however, the description provided aligns more precisely with the Base CWE. CWE-125 can precede CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset) and CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer). While those could potentially be related, there is not enough evidence to confirm.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.00 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1733): Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160): Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18775**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-18778**: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.
- **CVE-2020-24119**: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.
- **CVE-2020-27824**: A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
- **CVE-2021-1404**: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- **CVE-2021-1952**: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music
- **CVE-2021-1977**: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music
