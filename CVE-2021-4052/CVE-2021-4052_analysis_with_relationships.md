# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name                      | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| CWE-416 | Use After Free                | 0.95      | Variant               | Allowed                       | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in web apps". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the **root cause** as "**use-after-free** in web apps." CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a Variant-level CWE that precisely matches this description: "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed." The description notes "**heap corruption**" as a weakness, which is a common consequence of use-after-free vulnerabilities, however, the root cause is the 'use after free', so CWE-416 is more appropriate. The Retriever Results also rank CWE-416 as the top candidate with a high combined score.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-416 does not have direct parent-child relationships listed in the provided information, it is often related to memory management issues. It can be a consequence of other weaknesses or lead to other vulnerabilities like CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
