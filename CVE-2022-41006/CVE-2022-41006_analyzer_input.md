# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41006

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no ip static route destination A.B.C.D gateway A.B.C.D mask A.B.C.D metric interface (lan|wan|vpn) description WORD command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to format command parameters into a stack buffer. The size of command parameters is not checked against the stack buffer size, which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow",
    "Improper input validation",
    "Use of `sprintf` without size checking"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution",
  "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted network packets sent to the `DetranCLI` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have the ability to issue commands via the `DetranCLI` interface. High privileges are required as indicated by the CVSS vector 'PR:H'."
}
