# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-26447

## Vulnerability Description
In BT firmware, there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to a **missing bounds check**. This could lead to remote code execution with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID ALPS06784478 Issue ID ALPS06784478.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing bounds check**
- **weakness:** **out of bounds write**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **product:** BT firmware

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in BT firmware leading to an out-of-bounds write due to a missing bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) without requiring additional execution privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**  Exploitation occurs through the Bluetooth firmware.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No user interaction is needed for exploitation. An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range to exploit the vulnerability.
