# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-27211

## Vulnerability Description
steghide 0.5.1 relies on a certain 32-bit seed value, which makes it easier for attackers to detect hidden data.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reliance on a certain 32-bit seed value**
- **impact:** detect hidden data
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** steghide
- **version:** 0.5.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-27211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Steghide generates the seed for embedding data. It takes the user-provided password, calculates its MD5 hash (128 bits), splits the hash into four 32-bit chunks, and then XORs these chunks together to produce a single 32-bit seed.
*   This process reduces the password's complexity to a 32-bit value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Brute-forceable Seed:** The 32-bit seed space (2^32 possible values) is small enough to be brute-forced. This means an attacker can bypass the password entirely by trying all possible seeds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Extraction:** An attacker can extract hidden data from a stego file without knowing the original password, bypassing the intended security measure.
*   If encryption was disabled during embedding, the extracted data will be in plain text. Otherwise, the extracted data will be encrypted and require the password for decryption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Brute-force:** The primary attack vector is to brute-force the 32-bit seed.
*   The attacker needs access to the stego file (the file with the embedded data).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the stego file.
*   The attacker needs a tool capable of trying all possible 32-bit seeds against the stego file (such as the `stegcrack` tool mentioned in the provided content).

**Additional Details:**

*   The `stegcrack` tool is designed to exploit this vulnerability. It works by iterating through possible seeds and checking if the generated data matches the metadata embedded by Steghide (e.g., the magic bytes 0x73 0x68 0x8d).
*   The vulnerability applies to Steghide, an open-source steganography tool.
*   The provided content includes descriptions of how Steghide works and how to use the stegcrack exploit.

In summary, CVE-2021-27211 arises from the use of a weak, brute-forceable 32-bit seed derived from a password in Steghide. This enables attackers to extract hidden data from stego files by trying all possible seed values.
