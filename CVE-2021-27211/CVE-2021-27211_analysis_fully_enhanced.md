# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name  | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-334 | Small Space of Random Values | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-335 | Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | 0.80 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-337 | Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | 0.70 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description and CVE reference clearly point to the **rootcause** being the **reliance on a certain 32-bit seed value**, which leads to a small space of random values. This aligns directly with CWE-334 (Small Space of Random Values). The attacker can brute-force this limited seed space to detect hidden data. The CVE reference specifies that the MD5 hash is split into four 32-bit chunks and XORed, reducing the password's complexity and making it brute-forceable. The `stegcrack` tool exploits this by iterating through possible seeds. While CWE-335 (Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) and CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) are also relevant, CWE-334 best captures the core issue of the limited seed space that enables the attack. MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-334 because it is at the Base level of abstraction.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-334 is a Base level CWE. It is related to CWE-335 (Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)), which has variants like CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)). CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) is a parent Class of CWE-334, but CWE-334 is more specific to the small seed space.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of the small seed value and brute-force attack in the CVE reference)

## Known Examples for CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0583** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0583](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0583): Product uses 5 alphanumeric characters for filenames of expense claim reports, stored under web root.
- **CVE-2002-0903** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0903](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0903): Product uses small number of random numbers for a code to approve an action, and also uses predictable new user IDs, allowing attackers to hijack new accounts.
- **CVE-2003-1230** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1230](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1230): SYN cookies implementation only uses 32-bit keys, making it easier to brute force ISN.
- **CVE-2004-0230** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0230](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0230): Complex predictability / randomness (reduced space).
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-26098**: An instance of small space of random values in the RPC API of FortiSandbox before 4.0.0 may allow an attacker in possession of a few information pieces about the state of the device to possibly predict valid session IDs.
- **CVE-2021-26909**: Automox Agent prior to version 31 uses an insufficiently protected S3 bucket endpoint for storing sensitive files, which could be brute-forced by an attacker to subvert an organization's security program. The issue has since been fixed in version 31 of the Automox Agent.
- **CVE-2021-44151**: An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. As the session cookies are small, an attacker can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application (e.g., /goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized content, when a valid cookie value is hit.
- **CVE-2022-3959**: A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in drogon up to 1.8.1. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component Session Hash Handler. The manipulation leads to small space of random values. The attack may be launched remotely. Upgrading to version 1.8.2 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is c0d48da99f66aaada17bcd28b07741cac8697647. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-213464.


## Known Examples for CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-7010** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7010](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7010): Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2019-11495** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-11495](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-11495): server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds
