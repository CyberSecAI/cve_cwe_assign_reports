# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" and "**heap corruption**." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms "**Use after free**" as the root cause. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is the most appropriate mapping because it directly addresses the vulnerability where memory is reused or referenced after it has been freed, leading to potential **heap corruption**. The vulnerability occurs in WebShare in Google Chrome, and a remote attacker can exploit it via a crafted HTML page, aligning with the typical use-after-free scenario. The "Retriever Results" also strongly suggest CWE-416 as the primary CWE with the highest score.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. While other CWEs like CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry) could be considered, CWE-416 is more precise given the explicit mention of "use after free." There are no direct parent-child relationships that influence the mapping decision significantly.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of "use after free" and high retriever score)
