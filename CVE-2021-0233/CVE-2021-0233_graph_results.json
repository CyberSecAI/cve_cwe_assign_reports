  "query": "A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS ACX500 Series, ACX4000 Series, may allow an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a high rate of specific packets to the device, resulting in a Forwarding Engine Board (FFEB) crash. Continued receipt of these packets will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on ACX500 Series, ACX4000 Series 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S2.",
