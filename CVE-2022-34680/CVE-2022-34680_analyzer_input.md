- **component:** kernel mode layer handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-34680:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer truncation in the kernel mode layer handler of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer truncation: A primitive value is truncated when cast to a smaller primitive, leading to data loss.
- Out-of-bounds read: The integer truncation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- An unprivileged regular user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a regular user account on the system.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the kernel mode layer handler of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux.
- The vulnerability is triggered by an integer truncation that results in an out-of-bounds read.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory also mentions this CVE as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities.
- Debian LTS advisory also mentions this CVE, specifying that the fix is included in `nvidia-graphics-drivers-legacy-390xx` version `390.157-1~deb10u1`.
