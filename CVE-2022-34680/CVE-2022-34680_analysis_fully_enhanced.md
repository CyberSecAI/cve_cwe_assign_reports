# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-197 | Numeric Truncation Error | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states that an **integer truncation** can lead to an out-of-bounds read within the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error), where a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, leading to data loss. The resulting out-of-bounds read is a consequence of this truncation. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating the root cause is **integer truncation** leading to an out-of-bounds read. CWE-197 is a Base level CWE and the mapping guidance allows the usage."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-197 doesn't have direct parent-child relationships in the provided information. However, it *CanPrecede* CWE-125 since the **integer truncation** directly causes the out-of-bounds read. While CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is similar, CWE-197 is more specific to the reported **integer truncation**."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of **integer truncation** as the root cause and its direct link to the out-of-bounds read).

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description also mentions that the **integer truncation** leads to an out-of-bounds read, which is represented by CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The *impact* of the **integer truncation** is an out-of-bounds read. The CWE-125 is a consequence of the **integer truncation**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). However, since the root cause is **integer truncation**, CWE-125 is marked as a secondary candidate."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.7 (Medium confidence because the root cause is **integer truncation**, making CWE-125 a secondary effect).



## Known Examples for CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545): Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.

- **CVE-2021-30663** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663): Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2018-10887** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887): Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **CVE-2019-1010006** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006): Chain: compiler optimization (CWE-733) removes or modifies code used to detect integer overflow (CWE-190), allowing out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2010-2753** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753): Chain: integer overflow leads to use-after-free
- **CVE-2005-1513** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513): Chain: integer overflow in securely-coded mail program leads to buffer overflow. In 2005, this was regarded as unrealistic to exploit, but in 2020, it was rediscovered to be easier to exploit due to evolutions of the technology.
