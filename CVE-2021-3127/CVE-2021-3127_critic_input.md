# Critic Input for CVE-2021-3127



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
NATS Server 2.x before 2.2.0 and JWT library before 2.0.1 have Incorrect Access Control because Import Token bindings are mishandled.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **mishandled Import Token bindings**
- **weakness:** **incorrect access control**
- **product:** NATS Server and JWT library
- **version:** 2.x before 2.2.0 and before 2.0.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NATS JWT library incorrectly handled import token validation. Instead of rejecting tokens with mismatched bindings, it only warned about the mismatches. This allowed an attacker to reuse an import token from another account for their own account and access any subject from the exporting account, not just the subject specified in the token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Incorrect import token validation: The JWT library failed to enforce correct binding of import tokens to the importing account.
    - Lack of rejection of invalid tokens: Instead of rejecting mismatched tokens, the library only issued a warning.
    - Account JWTs as semi-public information: The NATS account server system treated account JWTs as semi-public, enabling attackers to enumerate and retrieve import tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized access to subjects: A malicious actor could access any subject from an exporting account by reusing an import token, which should only have provided limited access.
    - Cross-account access: Attackers can gain access to subjects across different accounts, violating intended access restrictions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Tampered Account JWTs: Attackers upload their own manipulated account JWT to the account server.
    - Reusing Import tokens: Attackers reuse import tokens from other accounts to access subjects in exporting accounts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to update the account server with malicious JWTs: Attackers must be able to upload tampered Account JWTs to the NATS account server.
    - Knowledge of valid account JWTs and Import tokens: Attackers must be able to enumerate and retrieve import tokens from other accounts.

The provided content provides more detail than the official CVE description. It includes specifics on the JWT validation issue, the impact on cross-account subject access, and the steps required for exploitation. It also includes a python script for auditing JWTs for the vulnerability.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the **mishandling of Import Token bindings**, leading to **incorrect access control**. The CVE reference explains that the JWT library **failed to enforce correct binding of import tokens**, and instead of rejecting tokens with mismatched bindings, it only issued a warning. This allowed attackers to reuse import tokens from other accounts to access subjects in exporting accounts. The core issue is that the system is not sufficiently proving the identity or authorization of the actor (the user with the JWT), which directly aligns with CWE-287, Improper Authentication. The system incorrectly assumes that the JWT is valid for the current account, even though it might belong to another account.
  - The evidence supports CWE-287 with the description of JWT token mishandling. An attacker can reuse import tokens from another account to access restricted subjects. This vulnerability stems from the system insufficiently proving that the user claiming access through JWT is authorized to do so, aligning directly with CWE-287. The Retriever results list CWE-287, but mark it as DISCOURAGED. This is because CWE-287 is a class-level CWE, however, a more specific base-level CWE is not apparent. Therefore, it is appropriate to classify this vulnerability as CWE-287.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE. It is related to other authentication and authorization CWEs. Specifically, it can be related to CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, because the attacker is essentially bypassing authorization by using a key (the JWT) that is not properly validated against the current account. It is also related to CWE-347, Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, as the JWT's signature might be valid, but the system does not properly verify if the JWT is intended for the current account.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a secondary candidate. An attacker can gain access to data or records by using a user-controlled key (the import token) that isn't properly validated or restricted to the intended user. The vulnerability allows attackers to reuse import tokens from other accounts, which directly modifies the access control mechanism. This bypasses intended authorization checks.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-639 is a base-level CWE. It is child of CWE-284 Improper Access Control.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium evidence from CVE reference materials)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-347, Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, is another secondary candidate. While the signature itself might be valid, the vulnerability lies in the system's failure to properly verify that the token is intended for the current account. This stems from the **mishandling of Import Token bindings**, leading to the token being used in a context where it shouldn't be valid. The root cause is the incorrect handling of the JWT import token within the NATS server and JWT library. The library issues a warning instead of rejecting mismatched tokens.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-347 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-345, Improper Neutralization During Signature Processing.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.50 (Medium evidence from CVE reference materials)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-26315**: When the AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) boot rom loads, authenticates, and subsequently decrypts an encrypted FW, due to insufficient verification of the integrity of decrypted image, arbitrary code may be executed in the PSP when encrypted firmware images are used.
- **CVE-2021-41106**: JWT is a library to work with JSON Web Token and JSON Web Signature. Prior to versions 3.4.6, 4.0.4, and 4.1.5, users of HMAC-based algorithms (HS256, HS384, and HS512) combined with `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\LocalFileReference` as key are having their tokens issued/validated using the file path as hashing key - instead of the contents. The HMAC hashing functions take any string as input and, since users can issue and validate tokens, users are lead to believe that everything works properly. Versions 3.4.6, 4.0.4, and 4.1.5 have been patched to always load the file contents, deprecated the `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\LocalFileReference`, and suggest `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\InMemory` as the alternative. As a workaround, use `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\InMemory` instead of `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\LocalFileReference` to create the instances of one's keys.

- **CVE-2020-16122**: PackageKit's apt backend mistakenly treated all local debs as trusted. The apt security model is based on repository trust and not on the contents of individual files. On sites with configured PolicyKit rules this may allow users to install malicious packages.
- **CVE-2021-33840**: The server in Luca through 1.1.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (insertion of many fake records related to COVID-19) because Phone Number data lacks a digital signature.
- **CVE-2021-29462**: The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices is an SDK for development of UPnP device and control point applications. The server part of pupnp (libupnp) appears to be vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks because it does not check the value of the `Host` header. This can be mitigated by using DNS revolvers which block DNS-rebinding attacks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.14.6 and later.
- **CVE-2021-39689**: In multiple functions of odsign_main.cpp, there is a possible way to persist system attack due to a logic error in the code.

## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description


Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:


  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)

  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)

When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:


  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.



### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.




### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:


  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)

  - Group can perform undesired actions

  - ACL parse error does not fail closed





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

ChildOf -> CWE-863
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ParentOf -> CWE-566

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For each and every data access, ensure that the user has sufficient privilege to access the record that is being requested.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Description:** Make sure that the key that is used in the lookup of a specific user's record is not controllable externally by the user or that any tampering can be detected.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use encryption in order to make it more difficult to guess other legitimate values of the key or associate a digital signature with the key so that the server can verify that there has been no tampering.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.



## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** Use an authentication framework or library such as the OWASP ESAPI Authentication feature.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
