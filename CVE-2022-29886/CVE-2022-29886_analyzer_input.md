# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-29886

## Vulnerability Description
An **integer overflow** vulnerability exists in the way ESTsoft Alyac 2.5.8.544 parses OLE files. A specially-crafted OLE file can lead to a **heap buffer overflow**, which can result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **vector:** specially-crafted OLE file
- **product:** ESTsoft Alyac
- **version:** 2.5.8.544

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow during the calculation of the buffer size needed to store the Mini FAT sectors of an OLE file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to heap buffer overflow. Specifically, the multiplication of the "Number of Mini FAT sectors" and "sector size" is done using 32-bit integers, which can overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value, leading to allocating an undersized buffer. Later, when data is copied into this undersized buffer, a heap buffer overflow occurs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted OLE file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide the malicious file to be scanned by the vulnerable software.
