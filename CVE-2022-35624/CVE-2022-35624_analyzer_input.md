# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-35624

## Vulnerability Description
In Nordic nRF5 SDK for Mesh 5.0, a **heap overflow** vulnerability can be triggered by sending a series of segmented packets with SegO > SegN

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **vector:** series of segmented packets with SegO > SegN
- **product:** Nordic nRF5 SDK for Mesh
- **version:** 5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap overflow that occurs during the reassembly of transport packets in the Nordic Bluetooth Mesh SDK.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The document mentions "Unsaved changes to Drive", which suggests that successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to data corruption or loss. It could also potentially enable arbitrary code execution on the affected device if the attacker can control the overflowed data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists in the transport layer of the Bluetooth Mesh SDK, indicating that it is likely triggered through the receipt of maliciously crafted Mesh packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be within the range of the Bluetooth Mesh network and be able to send malicious mesh packets to a vulnerable device. They would need knowledge of the Bluetooth mesh protocol and the specific vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
The document mentions that JavaScript isn't enabled, so the file can't be opened and may not contain all the information on the vulnerability. It also doesn't specify the exact location in the code where the vulnerability occurs.
