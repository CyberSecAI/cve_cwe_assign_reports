# Analysis for CVE-2021-1047

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The root cause is an integer overflow. |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The integer overflow leads to an out-of-bounds read. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**out of bounds read** due to an **integer overflow**" in `valid_ipc_dram_addr` of `cm_access_control.c`. This directly aligns with CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) as the root cause. The resulting "**out of bounds read**" maps to CWE-125. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms information disclosure as a weakness. CWE-190 is selected as the primary CWE because the **integer overflow** is the triggering condition. The "Retriever Results" show a high score for CWE-190. Although CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) has the highest score, it's less relevant because the vulnerability's description clearly points to an integer overflow, rather than use of an uninitialized resource. CWE-125 is selected as the secondary CWE because the integer overflow directly causes the **out-of-bounds read**. MITRE mapping guidance for both CWE-190 and CWE-125 indicates that they are ALLOWED mappings.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a base level CWE. There are no direct relationships listed in the provided information that are highly relevant to this case. CWE-125 is also a base level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials).
