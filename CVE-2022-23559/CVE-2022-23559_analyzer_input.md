# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-23559

## Vulnerability Description
Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an **integer overflow** in embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user could trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain scenarios, this can then result in **heap OOB read/write**. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow and heap OOB read/write**
- **impact:** heap OOB read/write
- **vector:** crafting a TFLite model
- **product:** Tensorflow
