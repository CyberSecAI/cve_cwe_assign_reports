## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the FreeRDP `drive` channel is **missing input length validation**. A malicious server sends a path length without proper validation on the client-side. This leads to an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability where the client attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) accurately represents the **missing input length validation** aspect, as the server is sending a quantity (length) that the client isn't properly validating. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a direct consequence of the **missing input length validation** since the client reads past the buffer. The MITRE mapping guidance allows both CWEs."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-1284 is related to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), as it's a specific case of missing input validation. CWE-125 is a common consequence of CWE-1284. The graph shows that CWE-1284 can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) because an invalid length may be used for memory allocation."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to clear evidence from the description and CVE details)

## Known Examples for CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3701](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3701): program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1708): memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field
- **CVE-2008-0977** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0977](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0977): large value in a length field leads to memory consumption and crash when no more memory is available
- **CVE-2006-3791** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3791](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3791): large key size in game program triggers crash when a resizing function cannot allocate enough memory
- **CVE-2004-2589** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2589](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2589): large Content-Length HTTP header value triggers application crash in instant messaging application due to failure in memory allocation
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-18899**: An uncontrolled memory allocation in DataBufdata(subBox.length-sizeof(box)) function of Exiv2 0.27 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a crafted input.
- **CVE-2021-3527**: A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.
- **CVE-2021-36174**: A memory allocation with excessive size value vulnerability in the license verification function of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow an attacker to perform a denial of service attack via specially crafted license blobs.
- **CVE-2020-5802**: An attacker-controlled memory allocation size can be passed to the C++ new operator in RnaDaSvr.dll by sending a specially crafted ConfigureItems message to TCP port 4241. This will cause an unhandled exception, resulting in termination of RSLinxNG.exe. Observed in FactoryTalk 6.11. All versions of FactoryTalk Linx are affected.
