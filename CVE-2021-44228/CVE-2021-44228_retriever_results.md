# CWE Search Results for CVE-2021-44228

## Query
    Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.

### Retriever Score Interpretation
The scores are calculated with a sophisticated methodology that considers multiple factors:

- **Dense Vector Search**: Measures semantic similarity to the vulnerability description (0-1 scale)
- **Property Graph**: Identifies CWEs with relevant structural relationships (0-1 scale)
- **Sparse Retrieval**: Finds exact keyword matches using BM25, normalized to 0-1 scale (original scores capped at 1000)

The combined score is calculated as follows:

1. **Individual Scores**: Each retriever score is normalized to 0-1 scale and weighted according to retriever weights

2. **Quality-Adjusted Consensus Boost**: When multiple retrievers agree on a CWE:
- The boost is scaled by the average confidence score (higher confidence = higher boost)
- Different retriever combinations receive different boost modifiers:
    - Sparse + Dense (more independent signals): +20% boost
    - Sparse + Graph (partially independent): +10% boost  
    - Dense + Graph (more overlap): -10% boost reduction

3. **Relationship Boosting**: CWEs identified by the graph retriever with explicit relationships receive:
- Additional weight to the graph retriever's score
- A relationship bonus based on the number of relevant relationships

4. **Abstraction Level Adjustment**:
- Base CWEs: +30% boost
- Variant CWEs: +20% boost
- Class CWEs: -20% penalty
- Pillar CWEs: -40% penalty

This approach favors CWEs that are identified by multiple independent retrieval methods, and prioritizes those with explicit structural relationships to other CWEs.


### Result Analysis
- **10** CWEs were found by multiple retrievers, indicating stronger relevance.
- The **sparse** retriever found the most relevant CWEs (20).
- The results are primarily Base-level CWEs, which balance specificity and generality.

Higher scores indicate stronger relevance. CWEs found by multiple independent retrievers, with explicit relationships, and at appropriate abstraction levels are particularly significant.
