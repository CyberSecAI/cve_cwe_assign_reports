# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the tokio crate before 1.8.4, and 1.9.x through 1.13.x before 1.13.1, for Rust. In certain circumstances involving a closed oneshot channel, there is a **data race and memory corruption**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **data race and memory corruption**
- **product:** tokio crate
- **version:** before 1.8.4, and 1.9.x through 1.13.x before 1.13.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A data race occurs when a `tokio::sync::oneshot` channel is closed via `oneshot::Receiver::close` and, concurrently, `oneshot::Sender::send` is called while the corresponding `oneshot::Receiver` is being `await`ed or calling `try_recv`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Data race due to concurrent access of a shared memory location by the sender and receiver halves of the channel after the receiver has been closed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption can occur due to the data race.
- **Attack vectors**: Concurrent calls to `oneshot::Sender::send` and either `await` or `try_recv` on the `oneshot::Receiver` after `oneshot::Receiver::close` has been called.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trigger the described race condition by concurrently interacting with the `oneshot` channel after it has been closed. Specifically, they must trigger `close()` on the receiver end, and concurrently call `send()` on the sender, and either `await` or `try_recv` on the receiver.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **data race and memory corruption** issue within the tokio crate. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is a **data race** occurring when a `tokio::sync::oneshot` channel is closed via `oneshot::Receiver::close` and, concurrently, `oneshot::Sender::send` is called while the corresponding `oneshot::Receiver` is being `await`ed or calling `try_recv`. This directly aligns with CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread), which describes a scenario where two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, potentially leading to resources being used while invalid. The "Usage: Allowed" mapping guidance for CWE-366 reinforces its suitability. The description notes "memory corruption" as an impact. Since the root cause is the race condition, CWE-366 is the primary weakness. The concurrent access and potential for invalid resource state firmly establish this classification.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-366 is a Base level CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.90 (Strong alignment between vulnerability details and CWE definition)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions "**memory corruption**" as an impact of the data race. Given the context of a data race and concurrent access to memory, CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-415 (Double Free) are potential secondary candidates. If the **data race** leads to a memory location being freed and then subsequently accessed (Use After Free), or freed multiple times (Double Free), these CWEs could be relevant. Without specific details confirming that the race condition *directly* leads to a use-after-free or double-free scenario, these are considered secondary candidates. The "Usage: Allowed" mapping guidance for both CWE-416 and CWE-415 supports their potential relevance.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While CWE-416 and CWE-415 are plausible impacts of a data race, they are dependent on specific memory management behaviors triggered by the race condition.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.60 for CWE-416, 0.50 for CWE-415 (Moderate confidence, contingent on more detailed information about the memory corruption mechanism)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).

## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ChildOf -> CWE-662
ChildOf -> CWE-662

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use locking functionality. This is the recommended solution. Implement some form of locking mechanism around code which alters or reads persistent data in a multithreaded environment.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Create resource-locking validation checks. If no inherent locking mechanisms exist, use flags and signals to enforce your own blocking scheme when resources are being used by other threads of execution.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).



## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

### Alternative Terms
Double-free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Ensure that each allocation is freed only once. After freeing a chunk, set the pointer to NULL to ensure the pointer cannot be freed again. In complicated error conditions, be sure that clean-up routines respect the state of allocation properly. If the language is object oriented, ensure that object destructors delete each chunk of memory only once.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Use a static analysis tool to find double free instances.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).
- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
