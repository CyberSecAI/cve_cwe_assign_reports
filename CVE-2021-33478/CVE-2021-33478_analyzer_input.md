# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-33478

## Vulnerability Description
The TrustZone implementation in certain Broadcom MediaxChange firmware could allow an unauthenticated, physically proximate attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution in the TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of an affected device. This, for example, affects certain Cisco IP Phone and Wireless IP Phone products before 2021-07-07. Exploitation is possible only when the attacker can disassemble the device in order to control the voltage/current for chip pins.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **vector:** voltage/current manipulation of chip pins
- **attacker:** unauthenticated, physically proximate attacker
- **product:** Cisco IP Phone and Wireless IP Phone
- **version:** before 2021-07-07
- **component:** TrustZone implementation

  "technical_details": "The vulnerability lies in the TrustZone implementation of Broadcom MediaxChange firmware. To exploit, an attacker must physically access the device, dismount the backplate, and send a series of impulses to the chipset, which reloads the device into a special mode. This mode grants access to the bootshell. By issuing specific commands with crafted parameters, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "remediation": "Software updates have been released by Cisco to address the vulnerability. Customers are advised to refer to the Cisco bug IDs for each affected product for fixed software release information."
