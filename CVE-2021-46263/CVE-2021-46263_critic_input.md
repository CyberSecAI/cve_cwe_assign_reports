## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow located in the `/goform/setPowerSave` page of the Tenda Router AC series, specifically affecting the `wifiTime` module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The program does not check the length of the user-provided `wifiTimeClose` input before storing it in the `wl_wifictl_time_interval` nvram variable using `nvram_set`.
- **Uncontrolled Copy:** The program later retrieves the value from the nvram variable using `nvram_get` and copies it to a stack-allocated buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause the device to crash, leading to a DoS condition.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With carefully crafted overflow data, an attacker could potentially overwrite parts of the stack and achieve remote code execution on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/setPowerSave` page.
- **`wifiTimeClose` Parameter:** The malicious input is provided through the `wifiTimeClose` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This likely means being on the same local network or having access to the router's WAN interface if it's exposed to the internet.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to create and send HTTP POST requests with a specific payload for the `wifiTimeClose` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was found in Tenda Router AC11, specifically firmware version `AC11_V02.03.01.104_CN`.
- The content includes references to images that demonstrate the vulnerability but are not directly included in the text.
- The timeline indicates that the vulnerability was reported in January 2022 and assigned CVE-2021-46263 in February 2022.
- The content suggests that the user input for `wifiTimeClose` is initially stored in the variable `v10` before being set with `nvram_set`, then later retrieved with `nvram_get` into `v9` which is copied into `a2` which is where the overflow happens

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **stack buffer overflow** in the `wifiTime` module of the Tenda AC Series Router. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by detailing how the program copies user-provided input (`wifiTimeClose`) to a stack-allocated buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to the overflow. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. The impact is Denial of Service (DoS), which is a common consequence of buffer overflows. While CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) could be considered a broader category, CWE-121 is more specific because it identifies the location of the buffer on the stack.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a more general class of buffer overflows. Since the description specifically mentions "stack buffer overflow", using the more specific CWE-121 is appropriate. There are no direct relationships found for CWE-121, and the MITRE mapping guidance indicates that this is ALLOWED for stack buffer overflows.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from the technical description and CVE reference materials, which specifically identify a stack buffer overflow)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.
