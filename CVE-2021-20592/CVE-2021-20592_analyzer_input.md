# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-20592

## Vulnerability Description
**Missing synchronization** vulnerability in GOT2000 series GT27 model communication driver versions 01.19.000 through 01.39.010, GT25 model communication driver versions 01.19.000 through 01.39.010 and GT23 model communication driver versions 01.19.000 through 01.39.010 and GT SoftGOT2000 versions 1.170C through 1.256S allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause DoS condition on the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function of the products by rapidly and repeatedly connecting and disconnecting to and from the MODBUS/TCP communication port on a target. Restart or reset is required to recover.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper synchronization when accessing shared resources within the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function of Mitsubishi Electric's GOT2000 series and GT SoftGOT2000 products. This is identified as CWE-820 (Missing Synchronization).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Synchronization:** The core issue is the absence of proper synchronization mechanisms when multiple connections interact with the shared resources for MODBUS/TCP communication. This can lead to a race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By rapidly and repeatedly connecting to and disconnecting from the MODBUS/TCP communication port, an attacker can disrupt the communication capabilities of the affected devices. This renders the device unable to communicate properly on the network and could disrupt industrial processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the MODBUS/TCP port of the affected GOT devices. This could be from within the local network or potentially remotely if the device is exposed to the internet.
*   **Repeated Connections/Disconnections:** The attack involves sending a high volume of connection and disconnection requests to the MODBUS/TCP port on the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the MODBUS/TCP port on the affected device.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Some understanding of network communication, specifically how MODBUS/TCP works, is likely required to execute the attack effectively.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to authenticate to the device, making it easier to exploit.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   **GOT2000 Series:**
    *   Models: GT27, GT25, GT23
    *   Communication driver versions: 01.19.000 to 01.39.010 (inclusive) when using "MODBUS/TCP Slave, Gateway" communication driver.
*   **GT SoftGOT2000:**
    *   Software versions: 1.170C to 1.256S (inclusive) when configured to use "MODBUS/TCP Slave" communication.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Software Updates:** Mitsubishi Electric has released updated versions of the communication drivers for the GOT2000 series and GT SoftGOT2000 to address the vulnerability. Users are advised to update to the following versions:
    *   GOT2000 series: Communication driver version 01.40.000 or later.
    *   GT SoftGOT2000: Software version 1.260W or later.
*   **Network Security:** It is also recommended to use network security measures like firewalls and VPNs to protect affected devices from unauthorized access. Additionally, restricting network access to only trusted networks and hosts, and using antivirus software, is also advised.
