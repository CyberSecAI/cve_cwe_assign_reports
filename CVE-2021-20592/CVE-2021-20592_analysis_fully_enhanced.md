| CWE-820 | Missing Synchronization | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Missing synchronization** vulnerability...allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause DoS condition...by rapidly and repeatedly connecting and disconnecting...". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is "a lack of proper synchronization when accessing shared resources within the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function" which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-820 (Missing Synchronization): "The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to synchronize access to the resource." The attack vector of rapidly connecting and disconnecting highlights the concurrent access issue. The impact is a DoS, which is a typical consequence of synchronization issues. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-820 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found, but CWE-820 can often lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400) as a consequence, though that isn't the primary weakness here.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary).



## Known Examples for CWE-820: Missing Synchronization
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-20592**: Missing synchronization vulnerability in GOT2000 series GT27 model communication driver versions 01.19.000 through 01.39.010, GT25 model communication driver versions 01.19.000 through 01.39.010 and GT23 model communication driver versions 01.19.000 through 01.39.010 and GT SoftGOT2000 versions 1.170C through 1.256S allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause DoS condition on the MODBUS/TCP slave communication function of the products by rapidly and repeatedly connecting and disconnecting to and from the MODBUS/TCP communication port on a target. Restart or reset is required to recover.
- **CVE-2022-3565**: A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function del_timer of the file drivers/isdn/mISDN/l1oip_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211088.
