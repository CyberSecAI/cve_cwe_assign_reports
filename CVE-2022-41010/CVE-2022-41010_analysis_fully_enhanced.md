| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **stack-based buffer overflow** due to improper handling of input size when copying data to a buffer. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used without checking the size of the input, leading to a buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality. This directly aligns with CWE-120 [Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')], which describes copying an input buffer to an output buffer without proper size validation. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this by mentioning that the root cause is a **stack-based buffer overflow** and the use of `sprintf` without bounds checking. Although CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is also a potential candidate, CWE-120 is more specific to the **buffer copy** operation being performed without proper size checks, making it a more accurate primary mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-120 indicates that it is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW, with the rationale that it should only be used for "Buffer Copy" operations where there is no "Checking [the] Size of Input". This vulnerability fits that description.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-120 is a Base level CWE. It is related to other buffer overflow CWEs like CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). It can also be related to CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) if the size calculation is the root cause of the overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of **stack-based buffer overflow** and the use of `sprintf` without bounds checking, confirmed by the CVE reference content.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write] is considered as a secondary candidate because the root cause is a **buffer overflow**. While the primary issue is the lack of size checking during the copy operation (CWE-120), the ultimate result is writing data beyond the intended buffer boundaries. CWE-787 represents the outcome of the overflow. The retriever results also list CWE-787 as a highly relevant CWE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE and a parent of CWE-121 [Stack-based Buffer Overflow] and CWE-122 [Heap-based Buffer Overflow].

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.70 (Medium confidence as it describes the effect of the primary weakness.)

- **CVE-2021-33909**: fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05.
- **CVE-2021-3420**: A flaw was found in newlib in versions prior to 4.0.0. Improper overflow validation in the memory allocation functions mEMALIGn, pvALLOc, nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc could case an integer overflow, leading to an allocation of a small buffer and then to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2021-22659**: Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Version 21.6 and below may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted Modbus packet allowing the attacker to retrieve or modify random values in the register. If successfully exploited, this may lead to a buffer overflow resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The FAULT LED will flash RED and communications may be lost. Recovery from denial-of-service condition requires the fault to be cleared by the user.
