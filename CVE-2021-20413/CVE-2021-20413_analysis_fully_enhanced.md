|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that "IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 4.0.0.4 could allow a remote attacker to **obtain sensitive information** when a **detailed technical error message is returned in the browser**." This aligns directly with CWE-209 [Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information], which describes a product generating an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data. The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` confirms the root cause as multiple vulnerabilities and the impact as unspecified, but the fix is in a later version, GDE 4.0.0.5. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-209, reinforcing this assessment. The retriever results also lists CWE-209 as the top candidate with a high combined score. The usage for CWE-209 is "Allowed" according to MITRE mapping guidance. While CWE-200 (Information Exposure) is a parent, CWE-209 is more specific because it emphasizes the error message as the source of information exposure.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-209 is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure). It can also be related to other CWEs such as CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page). The graph relationships show that CWE-209 can precede and can also be a peer of itself.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and supporting evidence.)
