# Summary

| CWE-226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states "**missing zeroization of plaintext buffers** in mbedtls_ssl_read to erase unused application data from memory". This aligns with CWE-226 [Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse], where a resource (in this case, plaintext buffers) is not cleared or zeroized after use, potentially exposing sensitive information. The vulnerability lies in the failure to remove sensitive data from a resource before it is reallocated, which aligns directly with the CWE description.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships are listed for CWE-226 in the provided data. However, it can be inferred that a failure to zeroize memory might lead to information leakage or exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to vulnerabilities like CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor].

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from vulnerability description and alignment with CWE-226 description)
