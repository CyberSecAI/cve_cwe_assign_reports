|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" in "New Tab Page in Google Chrome prior to 99.0.4844.74 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via specific user interactions." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause as "Use after free" and lists "Use after free" as a weakness. This aligns perfectly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes the product reusing or referencing memory after it has been freed. The CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping root causes. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships were found but that does not impact the identification of this specific weakness. The description of the vulnerability aligns directly with the definition of CWE-416.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "use after free" in both the vulnerability description and CVE reference.)
