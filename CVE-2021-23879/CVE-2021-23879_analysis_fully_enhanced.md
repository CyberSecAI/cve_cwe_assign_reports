# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-428 | Unquoted Search Path or Element | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**unquoted service path**" as the **rootcause**. This directly aligns with CWE-428 [Unquoted Search Path or Element], which describes a scenario where a product uses a search path containing an unquoted element, leading to potential access of resources in a parent path. The vulnerability allows local administrators to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, thus exploiting the **weakness** related to the unquoted path. The retriever results also give CWE-428 the highest score. CWE-428 is at the Base level of abstraction and its usage is ALLOWED according to MITRE.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other CWEs such as CWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element] and CWE-23 [Relative Path Traversal] are also listed, CWE-428 specifically addresses the **unquoted path**, making it the most relevant and specific choice. CWE-428 is a peer of CWE-427 and related to path traversal issues, but the primary issue here is the unquoted path itself.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and vulnerability key phrases)



## Known Examples for CWE-428: Unquoted Search Path or Element
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1185** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1185): Small handful of others. Program doesn't quote the "C:\Program Files\" path when calling a program to be executed - or any other path with a directory or file whose name contains a space - so attacker can put a malicious program.exe into C:.
- **CVE-2005-2938** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2938](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2938): CreateProcess() and CreateProcessAsUser() can be misused by applications to allow "program.exe" style attacks in C:
- **CVE-2000-1128** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1128](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-1128): Applies to "Common Files" folder, with a malicious common.exe, instead of "Program Files"/program.exe.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-23879**: Unquoted service path vulnerability in McAfee Endpoint Product Removal (EPR) Tool prior to 21.2 allows local administrators to execute arbitrary code, with higher-level privileges, via execution from a compromised folder. The tool did not enforce and protect the execution path. Local admin privileges are required to place the files in the required location.
- **CVE-2022-39959**: Panini Everest Engine 2.0.4 allows unprivileged users to create a file named Everest.exe in the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini folder. This leads to privilege escalation because a service, running as SYSTEM, uses the unquoted path of %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest Engine\\EverestEngine.exe and therefore a Trojan horse %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest.exe may be executed instead of the intended vendor-supplied EverestEngine.exe file.


## Known Examples for CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-25815** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25815](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25815): chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.
- **CVE-2022-4826** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4826](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4826): Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious "..exe" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH
- **CVE-2020-26284** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-26284](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-26284): A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched
- **CVE-2022-24765** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24765](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24765): Windows-based fork of git creates a ".git" folder in the C: drive, allowing local attackers to create a .git folder with a malicious config file
- **CVE-2019-1552** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1552](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1552): SSL package searches under "C:/usr/local" for configuration files and other critical data, but C:/usr/local might be world-writable.
