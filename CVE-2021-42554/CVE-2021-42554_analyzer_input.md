# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-42554

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with Kernel 5.0 before 05.08.42, Kernel 5.1 before 05.16.42, Kernel 5.2 before 05.26.42, Kernel 5.3 before 05.35.42, Kernel 5.4 before 05.42.51, and Kernel 5.5 before 05.50.51. An **SMM memory corruption** vulnerability in FvbServicesRuntimeDxe allows a possible attacker to write fixed or predictable data to SMRAM. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42554:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `FvbServicesRuntimeDxe` driver within InsydeH2O firmware.
- It involves an SMM memory corruption issue that allows an attacker to write fixed or predictable data to System Management RAM (SMRAM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The vulnerability stems from improper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to write data outside the designated memory area. This is classified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).
-   **SMM Memory Corruption:** The ability to write fixed/predictable data to SMRAM allows the attacker to control the data and potentially modify SMM code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain System Management Mode (SMM) privileges.
- **Code Execution:** The ability to write to SMRAM opens the door for attackers to execute arbitrary code within SMM, which is the most privileged level of execution on the system.
- **Data Modification/Disclosure:** Attackers could modify or disclose sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required (UI:N) for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to run code on the affected system, although the privilege level for the initial code execution is not strictly defined (PR:N).
- The attacker needs the ability to leverage the vulnerable driver to write to SMRAM.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects a range of InsydeH2O Kernel versions (5.0 to 5.5)
- The vulnerability was reported by Binarly.
- Patches are available from Insyde and various vendors like Siemens and NetApp.
- The vulnerability is related to a broader set of InsydeH2O vulnerabilities that were disclosed around the same time.
- The advisory from Siemens and Netapp provide lists of their affected products, indicating the widespread impact of this vulnerability.
