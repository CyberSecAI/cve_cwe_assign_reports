  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the **rootcause**, which directly corresponds to CWE-416 (Use After Free). The description also indicates that the vulnerability leads to "**heap corruption**," further supporting the selection of CWE-416. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as "Use after free" within the Blink Layout component.
