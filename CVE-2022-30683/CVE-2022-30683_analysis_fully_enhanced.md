| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**violation of secure design principles**" which directly aligns with CWE-657. The impact of this **weakness** is the ability to "decrypt secrets," indicating a failure in the overall architecture or design of the security mechanisms. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary corroborates this by stating "root_cause": "Violation of Secure Design Principles" and listing "CWE-657" as a **weakness**. Given that the attacker needs to already possess the secrets to decrypt them, a likely secondary **weakness** is CWE-312, where sensitive information is stored in cleartext, making the decryption possible. However, the primary issue is with the flawed design, which enables this decryption in the first place. The retriever results also lists CWE-657 as one of the matches. The mapping guidance for CWE-657 is DISCOURAGED but I am overriding the recommendation as it's the root cause as documented by the CVE.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-657 is a Class-level CWE, and as such, MITRE recommends looking for more specific CWEs. However, in this case, the specific secure design violation isn't further elaborated upon, making CWE-657 the most appropriate high-level categorization. It is related to other CWEs that describe specific design flaws, but without more context, this is the best fit. CWE-312 is related as a possible vulnerability that could be exploited in conjunction with CWE-657.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
