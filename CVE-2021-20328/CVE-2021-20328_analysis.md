# Analysis for CVE-2021-20328

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that the Java driver **fails to perform correct host name verification** on the KMS servers certificate. This aligns directly with CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch), which describes a scenario where a product communicates with a host providing a certificate but doesn't ensure the certificate is associated with that host. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, highlighting "Improper hostname verification during TLS/SSL handshake with the KMS server." CWE-297 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It's also ALLOWED per MITRE mapping guidance.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-297 is related to CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation), which is a broader category. However, since the vulnerability specifically mentions hostname mismatch, CWE-297 is a more precise fit. CWE-370 (Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check) is a peer of CWE-297, but revocation isn't mentioned in the description, making CWE-297 the better choice. The interception of traffic could lead to **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**, so CWE-319 is included as a secondary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description, CVE reference, and retriever results.)
