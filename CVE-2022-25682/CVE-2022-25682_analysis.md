# Analysis for CVE-2022-25682

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-823 | Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the usage of an **out of range pointer offset**, which directly aligns with this CWE. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: Since an **out-of-range pointer offset** could lead to writing outside the allocated memory, this CWE is a potential consequence. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states 'Memory corruption in MODEM UIM due to usage of **out of range pointer offset** while decoding command from card'. The core issue is the use of a pointer offset that goes beyond the intended memory boundary. This directly corresponds to CWE-823, which describes the 'Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset'. The description provides a clear indication of the root cause being related to pointer arithmetic leading to an out-of-range access. The Retriever results also rank CWE-823 as the top match with a high combined score."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-823 can lead to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) if the offset causes a write operation beyond the allocated buffer. The relationship between pointer arithmetic and memory corruption supports this mapping."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct mention of **out of range pointer offset** and high retriever score for CWE-823)
