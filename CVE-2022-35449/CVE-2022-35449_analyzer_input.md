## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in `otfcc` and related to CVE-2022-35449:

**Note**: The provided document actually describes multiple vulnerabilities, not just one. The listed vulnerabilities here include heap buffer overflows, global heap buffer overflows, SEGV and use-after-free (CVE-2022-33047). The CVE ID CVE-2022-35449 is not explicitly mentioned in the text, therefore the analysis below will be a summary of the mentioned vulnerabilities.

**1. Heap Buffer Overflows:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is insufficient bounds checking when copying data to heap buffers. This leads to writing beyond the allocated memory region.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Heap buffer overflow vulnerability is present.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation leads to crashes and potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted font files that trigger the overflow conditions are used as the attack vector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious font file to the otfcc tool.

**2. Global Heap Buffer Overflows:**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to heap overflows, but the vulnerability occurs in global memory regions instead of dynamically allocated memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Global heap buffer overflow vulnerability is present.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  Exploitation leads to crashes and potential arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Crafted font files that trigger the overflow conditions are used as the attack vector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious font file to the otfcc tool.

**3. SEGV (Segmentation Faults):**

*   **Root Cause:**  These are various cases of the tool accessing invalid memory addresses, often zero page or out-of-bounds addresses which causes a segmentation fault. This suggests issues such as null pointer dereferences or memory corruption.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Segmentation fault vulnerability is present.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation leads to crashes and denial of service.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Crafted font files that trigger the invalid memory access conditions are used as the attack vector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious font file to the otfcc tool.

**4. CVE-2022-33047: Use-After-Free**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory location is freed and then accessed, causing a use-after-free.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Use-after-free vulnerability is present.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation leads to crashes and potential arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Crafted font files that trigger the use-after-free conditions are used as the attack vector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious font file to the otfcc tool.

**Summary:**

This document provides evidence of multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in `otfcc`.  These include heap-based overflows, global-based overflows, segmentation faults, and a use-after-free vulnerability. The root cause for most of these is related to improper memory handling or insufficient bounds checking when processing untrusted font files.  Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service, crashes, and in some cases, potential arbitrary code execution. The attack vector relies on providing the otfcc tool with specially crafted font files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided sample files and crash info are useful for further analysis and creating exploits.
*   The document indicates multiple areas within the otfcc code that are potentially problematic.
*  The document also shows how to reproduce the crashes, through the command ` ./otfccbuild -O3 -q --force-cid [sample file] -o /dev/null`.
