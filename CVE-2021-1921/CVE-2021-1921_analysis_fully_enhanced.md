## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description points to "**Improper handling of hypervisor unmap operations for concurrent memory operations**" leading to memory corruption. This indicates a potential race condition where memory is accessed or freed while it's being unmapped by the hypervisor. CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) describes a scenario where the state of a resource changes between the check and its use, which aligns with the hypervisor unmap operation occurring concurrently with other memory operations.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-367 is a base-level CWE. It can precede CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition), CWE-416 (Use After Free), and CWE-415 (Double Free), all of which could result from a race condition leading to memory corruption. Given the limited information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact outcome, but CWE-367 accurately captures the **concurrent access issue**.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium evidence, as the description focuses on concurrent operations but lacks details on the specific type of memory corruption)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a possible consequence of the race condition. If memory is freed by the hypervisor while another operation is still using a pointer to that memory, it could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. However, without more specific details, this is only a potential outcome.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant-level CWE and a child of CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release). It can be preceded by CWE-367, as the race condition could cause the use-after-free.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Less confidence than CWE-367, as it's a potential consequence rather than the root cause)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is another possible outcome of the memory corruption. If the memory operations are not properly synchronized with the hypervisor unmap operations, an out-of-bounds write could occur.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base-level CWE and a parent of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition), and CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.50 (Even less confidence than CWE-416, as it's just a potential consequence of memory corruption)



## Known Examples for CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1743): TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0813): A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0594): PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.
- **CVE-2008-2958** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2958): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
- **CVE-2008-1570** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1570): chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-1921**: Possible memory corruption due to Improper handling of hypervisor unmap operations for concurrent memory operations in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2021-29657**: arch/x86/kvm/svm/nested.c in the Linux kernel before 5.11.12 has a use-after-free in which an AMD KVM guest can bypass access control on host OS MSRs when there are nested guests, aka CID-a58d9166a756. This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.
- **CVE-2020-11233**: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition While processing partition entries due to newly created buffer was read again from mmc without validation in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables
- **CVE-2020-13882**: CISOfy Lynis before 3.0.0 has Incorrect Access Control because of a TOCTOU race condition. The routine to check the log and report file permissions was not working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the race, an unprivileged attacker can set up a log and report file, and control that up to the point where the specific routine is doing its check. After that, the file can be removed, recreated, and used for additional attacks.
- **CVE-2020-15702**: TOCTOU Race Condition vulnerability in apport allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may exit the crashed process and exploit PID recycling to spawn a root process with the same PID as the crashed process, which can then be used to escalate privileges. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9 versions prior to 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.16 and 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.6. Was ZDI-CAN-11234.
