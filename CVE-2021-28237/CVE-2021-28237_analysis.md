| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.90      | Variant               | Allowed                         | Primary CWE           |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap-buffer overflow** via decode_preR13". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `decode_preR13_section` function when processing malformed DWG files. The ASAN report confirms a write occurring outside the bounds of allocated memory on the heap. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a more general class. Since the vulnerability is specifically identified as a heap-based overflow, CWE-122 is the more appropriate and specific choice.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.90 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials indicating a heap-based buffer overflow.)
