# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-28237

## Vulnerability Description
LibreDWG v0.12.3 was discovered to contain a **heap-buffer overflow** via decode_preR13.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-buffer overflow**
- **product:** LibreDWG
- **version:** v0.12.3
- **component:** decode_preR13

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `decode_preR13_section` function within the `decode.c` file of the LibreDWG library. This occurs when processing malformed DWG files.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, which indicates that a write operation is occurring outside the bounds of an allocated memory region on the heap. Specifically, the ASAN report indicates a write of size 8 at address `0x6120000001c8` which is a wild pointer within the `decode_preR13_section` function at line 470 of `decode.c`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The heap-buffer-overflow could potentially lead to:
    *   Memory corruption
    *   Program crashes
    *   Possible arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical data such as function pointers. The provided ASAN output shows the program crashing due to memory corruption.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted DWG file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the `dwgread` tool.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to provide a malformed DWG file as input to the `dwgread` program. The attacker would need to be able to supply a file to be opened by the vulnerable program.

*   **Additional details:**
    * The issue was found by a fuzzer and reported by user `zodf0055980`.
    * The vulnerability is located in a code path that is not enabled by default unless a git checkout is performed.
    * The issue was fixed by commit `ea0b952` which added more protections to PREP_TABLE in the `decode_preR13` function.
