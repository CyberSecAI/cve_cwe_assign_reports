# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-0435

## Vulnerability Description
A **stack overflow** flaw was found in the Linux kernels TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **stack overflow**
- **impact:** crash the system and escalate privileges
- **vector:** packet with malicious content
- **attacker:** remote user
- **product:** Linux kernels
- **component:** TIPC protocol functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `tipc_mon_rcv` function in the Linux kernel's TIPC module does not validate that the `member_cnt` field in a received `tipc_mon_domain` structure is below `MAX_MON_DOMAIN` before allocating memory. This allows an attacker to send a crafted packet with a large `member_cnt` value, leading to a stack overflow when a later, valid domain record is processed via memcpy.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds check",
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (kernel panic) by triggering a stack overflow. Without stack canaries or with a canary leak, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor can send a crafted `STATE_MSG` with a `tipc_mon_domain` that has a `member_cnt` larger than `MAX_MON_DOMAIN`. This crafted message can be sent remotely or locally if the system uses the TIPC protocol. If the TIPC module is loaded, the vulnerability can be triggered.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets as if it's a TIPC peer node, establishing a connection with the target system that is running a vulnerable kernel with the TIPC module loaded. The attacker must have the ability to manipulate the content of the messages sent, setting up an initial malicious message and then a trigger message."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "Linux kernel versions 4.8 and later prior to the fix (commit 9aa422ad3266)",
    "mitigations": "Disabling the TIPC module if not needed or updating to a patched kernel. If TIPC is required, network configurations should be reviewed to prevent unauthorized nodes from interacting with the cluster. It is also noted that with `CONFIG_FORTIFY_SRC=y` set there is a hard mitigation which will cause a kernel panic.",
