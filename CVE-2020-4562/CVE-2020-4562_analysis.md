# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-942 | Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains | 0.80 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.40 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that IBM Planning Analytics 2.0 "could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information by **allowing cross-window communication with unrestricted target origin via documentation frames**." This aligns with the description of CWE-942, "Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains," which describes a situation where a product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted. Allowing cross-window communication with an unrestricted target origin is essentially the same as having a permissive cross-domain policy with untrusted domains. The impact of obtaining sensitive information is a potential consequence of this **weakness**.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-942 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It is a child of CWE-183 (Permissive List of Allowed Inputs) and CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel). CWE-942 CanPrecede CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.80 (The vulnerability description strongly suggests a cross-domain policy issue, but lacks precise technical details.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions that a remote attacker could "obtain sensitive information". This impact is related to CWE-200. However, CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged because it represents the impact rather than the root cause. Since the primary **weakness** lies in the permissive cross-domain policy, CWE-200 is a secondary consideration, representing the potential impact of the **weakness**.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, which makes it less preferable than a Base or Variant level CWE if one is available. CWE-200 is often the result of other vulnerabilities.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.40 (CWE-200 is a potential impact of the vulnerability, but the root cause is more accurately represented by CWE-942.)
