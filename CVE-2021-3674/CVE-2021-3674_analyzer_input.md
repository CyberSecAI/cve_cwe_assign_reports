# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-3674

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in rizin. The create_section_from_phdr function allocates space for ELF section data by processing the headers. Crafted values in the headers can cause **out of bounds reads**, which can lead to memory corruption and possibly code execution through the binary objects callback function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **out of bounds reads**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **vector:** Crafted values in the headers
- **product:** rizin
- **component:** create_section_from_phdr function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `vector_free_elems` function when parsing an ELF file with corrupted section headers. Specifically, when section headers are invalid, the `RzBinElfSection->name` pointer, which is supposed to point to the section name, can be overwritten with arbitrary data. This happens due to improper handling of corrupted section offsets during the creation of RzVectors for different sections in the binary.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to a use-after-free condition. The `vector_free_elems` iterates over `RzVector` structures that store section data. The `RzVector->free` callback (`rz_bin_elf_section_free`) attempts to `free()` the `RzBinElfSection->name` member. If a crafted or corrupted binary with invalid section offsets is parsed, this `name` pointer may be overwritten with an invalid memory address on the heap. When the code later attempts to `free()` this overwritten pointer, it results in a double-free or a free of an arbitrary memory address, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.
- **Uncontrolled Pointer Dereference:** The corrupted section headers lead to an uncontrolled pointer dereference when attempting to free the potentially invalid `RzBinElfSection->name` pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service. As evidenced by the provided crash logs, the incorrect free operation in `vector_free_elems` causes a segmentation fault, crashing the `rizin` tool. This makes it unusable for analyzing specially crafted ELF files.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities like this can sometimes be exploited for more serious issues, such as arbitrary code execution if an attacker can reliably control the value of the overwritten pointer and the state of the heap. However, the provided material only shows the crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious ELF file:** An attacker could craft a malicious ELF file with corrupted or invalid section headers. Loading or analyzing this file via `rizin` or `rz-bin` triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to provide a specially crafted ELF file to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through several means, including tricking a user into analyzing a malicious file or providing it as input to automated tooling that uses `rizin`.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The provided POC file contains the pattern `0xacabacabacabacab` within the section headers, which becomes the target of the free operation, demonstrating that the attacker can control the memory address to be freed.
- The vulnerability was fixed in pull request #1313, which also addresses related warnings when there are no sections in the binary.
- Test cases were created in rizin-testbins to confirm the fix.
