# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-40401

## Vulnerability Description
A **use-after-free** vulnerability exists in the RS-274X aperture definition tokenization functionality of Gerbv 2.7.0 and dev (commit b5f1eacd) and Gerbv forked 2.7.1. A specially-crafted gerber file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-40401:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `parse_aperture_definition` function of Gerbv when parsing RS-274X files. The function uses `gerb_fgetstring` to read a string from the file, then tokenizes it using `strtok`. If `gerb_fgetstring` returns NULL in a subsequent call, the following call to `strtok` can operate on a previously freed buffer, causing the use-after-free condition. The use of `strtok` also introduces a heap corruption issue, by writing null bytes into the freed memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. After a buffer is allocated, used, and freed, the code attempts to access that freed memory through the internal pointer used by `strtok`.
*   **Heap Corruption:**  `strtok` overwrites delimiter characters with null bytes, causing heap corruption when used on a freed buffer.
*   **Unchecked Return Values:** The code does not check the return value of `gerb_fgetstring` against NULL before passing the result to `strtok`, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Improper Usage of strtok:** The code does not adhere to the strtok's expected usage by not passing NULL as the first argument of `strtok` for subsequent calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** The use-after-free can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code by carefully crafting the heap and controlling the contents of the freed memory region that is accessed via `strtok`.
*   **Information Leak:** The use-after-free allows an attacker to leak heap memory by controlling the value returned by `strtok` through heap manipulation.
*   **Denial of Service:** A crash can occur from a NULL dereference if `strtok` operates on a freed buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Gerber File:** An attacker provides a specially crafted RS-274X Gerber file to the vulnerable software.
*   **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when `gerbv_open_image` attempts to parse the malicious file, leading to the use-after-free during aperture definition parsing (`parse_aperture_definition`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious Gerber file to be processed by Gerbv.
*   No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability if Gerbv is used as a server-side component (e.g. converting Gerber files into images), making it reachable via network without user interaction or privilege requirements.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the function `parse_aperture_definition` in `src/gerber.c`.
*   The vulnerable code is triggered by the `%ADD` command in RS-274X files.
*   The exploit requires calling `parse_aperture_definition` multiple times, causing `strtok` to operate on a freed buffer due to a NULL return value from `gerb_fgetstring`.
*   The provided PoCs demonstrate heap corruption, information leak, and a potential crash.
*   The Talos report provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and an exploit approach using memory leak and macro redefinition.
