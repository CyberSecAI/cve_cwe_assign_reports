# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-29247 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1004 | Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-614 | Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute | 0.5 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag for a cookie**, which directly matches the description of CWE-1004, "Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag". The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by stating the **root cause** is the "Lack of httponly" and the **weakness** is "Missing `HttpOnly` flag on a cookie". CWE-1004 is a Variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance indicates that the usage is ALLOWED. The description indicates a remote attacker could obtain sensitive information.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1004 does not have any direct relationships. The retriever results also suggest CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) as potential matches.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (Strong evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary candidate because the absence of the `HttpOnly` flag could lead to the cookie being transmitted over an insecure channel, although this is not explicitly stated. However, the primary issue is the missing flag, not necessarily the transmission itself. The vulnerability details suggest a potential attack vector involving the injection of malicious Javascript or XSS. If the cookie is transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS, this would be a more direct fit for CWE-319.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-319 is a Base level CWE. There are no direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.6 (Reasonable evidence based on potential for insecure transmission)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) is a potential secondary candidate if the cookies are used in HTTPS session without secure attribute, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session. It is not clear from the description if the Secure attribute is also missing.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-614 is a Variant level CWE. There are no direct relationships.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.5 (Limited evidence, depends on HTTPS session details)
