## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the **rootcause**, which is a direct match for CWE-416 (Use After Free). The vulnerability occurs in "Safe Browsing" in Google Chrome on Android, and the attacker can trigger the vulnerability by convincing a user to engage with a crafted HTML page, potentially leading to **heap corruption**. CWE-416 describes the condition where memory is reused or referenced after it has been freed, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section lists CWE-416 as the primary match and the most frequent CWE in similar descriptions, strengthening the selection. The Retriever Results also list CWE-416, further supporting this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match with explicit root cause in vulnerability description and supporting evidence from similar CVEs and retriever results)
