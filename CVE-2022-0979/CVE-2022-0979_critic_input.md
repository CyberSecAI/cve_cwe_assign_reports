## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free**" as the **rootcause**, which is a direct match for CWE-416 (Use After Free). The vulnerability occurs in "Safe Browsing" in Google Chrome on Android, and the attacker can trigger the vulnerability by convincing a user to engage with a crafted HTML page, potentially leading to **heap corruption**. CWE-416 describes the condition where memory is reused or referenced after it has been freed, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section lists CWE-416 as the primary match and the most frequent CWE in similar descriptions, strengthening the selection. The Retriever Results also list CWE-416, further supporting this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct match with explicit root cause in vulnerability description and supporting evidence from similar CVEs and retriever results)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).

## CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses, accesses, or otherwise operates on a resource after that resource has been expired, released, or revoked.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-3547:** Chain: race condition (CWE-362) might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference (CWE-476)
