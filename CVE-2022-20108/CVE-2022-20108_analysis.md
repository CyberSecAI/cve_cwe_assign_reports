# Analysis for CVE-2022-20108

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability is explicitly described as a stack-based buffer overflow. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds write, a direct consequence of the buffer overflow. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" leading to an "**out of bounds write**". The CVE reference summary confirms this. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) directly matches the stated root cause. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) represents the consequence of overflowing the buffer. Since the overflow occurs on the stack, CWE-121 is more specific than a general buffer overflow (CWE-119) and more precise than out-of-bounds write alone. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-121 and CWE-787.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119 and represents the result of writing beyond the allocated buffer, which is a direct consequence of the stack-based buffer overflow. CWE-121 can precede CWE-787 as the overflow leads to the out-of-bounds write.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match with vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
