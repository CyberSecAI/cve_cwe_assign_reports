# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-3031

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-212 | Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that "**Padding bytes in Ethernet packets ... are not cleared** before the data frame is created," leading to the leakage of random information from firewall memory. This directly corresponds to CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), where sensitive information is not properly removed before being made available to unauthorized actors. The **root cause** centers around the failure to clear sensitive data, which aligns perfectly with CWE-212's description. CWE-212 is also a base level CWE.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-212 can precede CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), as the uncleared information is then transmitted. CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) is related because memory is being reused without being cleared first, though CWE-212 is more specific to the transfer of information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct match with the **root cause** and the base level abstraction.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) is a potential secondary CWE. The **root cause** that padding bytes in Ethernet packets are not cleared before being used. If memory is allocated for these padding bytes, and that memory isn't cleared before being included in the Ethernet packet, then it could be argued that the vulnerability falls under CWE-226, as the resource (memory) is reused without properly removing sensitive information. However, CWE-212 is the stronger match.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-226 is a peer of CWE-212. CWE-226 focuses on resources not being cleared before reuse, while CWE-212 focuses on removing sensitive information before storage or transfer.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium confidence as CWE-212 is more specific, but CWE-226 is still relevant)



## Known Examples for CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0708): Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-24226**: In the AccessAlly WordPress plugin before 3.5.7, the file "resource/frontend/product/product-shortcode.php" responsible for the [accessally_order_form] shortcode is dumping serialize($_SERVER), which contains all environment variables. The leakage occurs on all public facing pages containing the [accessally_order_form] shortcode, no login or administrator role is required.
- **CVE-2021-33687**: SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (Enterprise Portal), versions - 7.10, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50 reveals sensitive information in one of their HTTP requests, an attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.
- **CVE-2021-3509**: A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **CVE-2021-34771**: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. This vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration information that their privileges might not otherwise allow them to access.
- **CVE-2021-25122**: When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.
- **CVE-2021-0644**: In conditionallyRemoveIdentifiers of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a trackable identifier due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11 Android-10Android ID: A-181053462
- **CVE-2020-11922**: An issue was discovered in WiZ Colors A60 1.14.0. The device sends unnecessary information to the cloud controller server. Although this information is sent encrypted and has low risk in isolation, it decreases the privacy of the end user. The information sent includes the local IP address being used and the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the device is connected to. (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
- **CVE-2021-24170**: The REST API endpoint get_users in the User Profile Picture WordPress plugin before 2.5.0 returned more information than was required for its functionality to users with the upload_files capability. This included password hashes, hashed user activation keys, usernames, emails, and other less sensitive information.
- **CVE-2021-24585**: The Timetable and Event Schedule WordPress plugin before 2.4.0 outputs the Hashed Password, Username and Email Address (along other less sensitive data) of the user related to the Even Head of the Timeslot in the response when requesting the event Timeslot data with a user with the edit_posts capability. Combined with the other Unauthorised Event Timeslot Modification issue (https://wpscan.com/reports/submissions/4699/) where an arbitrary user ID can be set, this could allow low privilege users with the edit_posts capability (such as author) to retrieve sensitive User data by iterating over the user_id
