This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18 PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12 PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.",
