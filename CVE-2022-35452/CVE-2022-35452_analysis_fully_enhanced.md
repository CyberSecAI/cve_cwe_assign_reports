| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write         | 0.90       | Base                  | ALLOWED                       | Primary CWE                     |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**heap-buffer overflow**" in OTFCC v0.10.4, aligning with the description of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms the presence of heap buffer overflows due to improper bounds checking when copying data to a heap allocated buffer. Although CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is also related, CWE-787 is more general and captures the essence of writing beyond buffer boundaries, regardless of allocation type. The "Top CWEs" section lists CWE-787 as the primary match for similar CVE descriptions, further supporting this classification. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates it is ALLOWED for out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a base-level CWE. It has child CWEs like CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which specify the memory allocation region. CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent of CWE-787, but is a Class level and thus less specific.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "heap-buffer overflow" and supporting evidence.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is considered a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description specifies a "heap-buffer overflow," making it a relevant, albeit less encompassing, classification. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms the **heap-buffer overflow** due to improper bounds checking. While CWE-787 is a more direct match representing the root cause (out-of-bounds write), CWE-122 provides additional context by specifying the heap as the memory region affected.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), specifying that the buffer is allocated in the heap. It is also a child of the class-level CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Medium-high confidence due to specific mention of a heap-based overflow, but less direct than CWE-787)



## Known Examples for CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268): Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2523): Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2021-29529** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29529): Chain: machine-learning product can have a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when some integer-oriented bounds are calculated by using ceiling() and floor() on floating point values (CWE-1339)
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
### Top 25 Examples

- **CVE-2020-11182**: Possible heap overflow while parsing NAL header due to lack of check of length of data received from user in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile
- **CVE-2020-18900**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the libexe_io_handle_read_coff_optional_header function of libyal libexe before 20181128. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this as described in libyal/libexe issue 1 on GitHub
- **CVE-2020-21600**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
- **CVE-2020-21602**: libde265 v1.0.4 contains a heap buffer overflow in the put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback function, which can be exploited via a crafted a file.
