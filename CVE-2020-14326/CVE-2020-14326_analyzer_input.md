# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-14326

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in RESTEasy, where RootNode incorrectly caches routes. This issue results in hash flooding, leading to slower requests with higher CPU time spent searching and adding the entry. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** hash flooding
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** RESTEasy
- **component:** RootNode
