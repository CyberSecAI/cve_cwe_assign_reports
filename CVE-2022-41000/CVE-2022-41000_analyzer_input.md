# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41000

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no gre index tunnel A.B.C.D source (A.B.C.D|null) dest A.B.C.D keepalive (on|off) interval (|null) retry (|null) description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` with unchecked input sizes when parsing commands, leading to stack-based buffer overflows. The size of the `command_parameter_X` is not checked against the size of `stack_buffer`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked input sizes in `sprintf` calls within `DetranCLI` command parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted network packet with an overly long string for a command parameter to trigger the vulnerable `sprintf` within `DetranCLI`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device and have access to the `DetranCLI` interface. Based on the CVSS vector, the attacker requires high privileges."
