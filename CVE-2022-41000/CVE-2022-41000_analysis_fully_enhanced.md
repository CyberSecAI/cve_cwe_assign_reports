# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.95 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability is described as a "**stack-based buffer overflow**" in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality. The root cause is the use of `sprintf` with unchecked input sizes, where the size of the `command_parameter_X` is not checked against the size of `stack_buffer`. This directly matches the description of CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input). While CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is also relevant, CWE-120 captures the fundamental issue of missing size validation during the buffer copy operation using `sprintf`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the size of input is not checked, which is the key characteristic of CWE-120. Although the overflow occurs on the stack, the lack of input size checking during the copy operation is the primary weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-120 indicates that it is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW, emphasizing that it is appropriate for buffer copy operations where there is no "Checking [the] Size of Input".
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-120 is a base level CWE. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of buffer overflow, specifying where the buffer is located (on the stack). CWE-120 CanPrecede CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, combined with the retriever results.)
