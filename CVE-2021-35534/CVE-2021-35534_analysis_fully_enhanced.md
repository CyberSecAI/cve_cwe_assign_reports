# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-35534

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.85 | Class | Primary | The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks, leading to unauthorized access to an internal database. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.65 | Class | Secondary | The internal database is exposed to users who should not have access to it, resulting in unauthorized data modifications. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.50 | Base | Secondary | Authentication may be missing for certain database functions, exacerbating the authorization issue. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description highlights an **insufficient security control** in the internal database access mechanism, enabling attackers with user credentials to bypass enforced security controls. This leads to unauthorized modifications of data/firmware and potentially disabling the product. The core issue here is the lack of proper authorization checks when accessing the internal database, which aligns with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). While CWE-285 is a class-level CWE, it appropriately describes the high-level issue. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a related weakness, as the internal database is exposed to users who should not have access. The description also suggests a possible lack of authentication for certain critical database functions, which maps to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE and is a child of CWE Pillar: Concurrency. CWE-668 represents a scenario where a resource is exposed to the wrong control sphere, potentially overlapping with the authorization issue. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) relates to scenarios where authentication is absent for critical functions, and it is a child of CWE-287(Improper Authentication). CWE-285 is the primary issue as it focuses on authorization problems, while CWE-668 and CWE-306 provide additional context on related missing security controls.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (The description clearly states a problem with authorization to the database.)

## Known Examples for CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-16247**: Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform, Versions 12.2.1 and prior. The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.
- **CVE-2020-15824**: In JetBrains Kotlin from 1.4-M1 to 1.4-RC (as Kotlin 1.3.7x is not affected by the issue. Fixed version is 1.4.0) there is a script-cache privilege escalation vulnerability due to kotlin-main-kts cached scripts in the system temp directory, which is shared by all users by default.
- **CVE-2021-22118**: In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and versions 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7, a WebFlux application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation: by (re)creating the temporary storage directory, a locally authenticated malicious user can read or modify files that have been uploaded to the WebFlux application, or overwrite arbitrary files with multipart request data.
- **CVE-2021-21334**: In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.
- **CVE-2021-22047**: In Spring Data REST versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.13, 3.5.0 - 3.5.5, and older unsupported versions, HTTP resources implemented by custom controllers using a configured base API path and a controller type-level request mapping are additionally exposed under URIs that can potentially be exposed for unauthorized access depending on the Spring Security configuration.
- **CVE-2021-22550**: An attacker can modify the pointers in enclave memory to overwrite arbitrary memory addresses within the secure enclave. It is recommended to update past 0.6.3 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/a47ef55db2337d29de19c50cd29b0deb2871d31c
- **CVE-2021-38712**: OneNav 0.9.12 allows Information Disclosure of the onenav.db3 contents. NOTE: the vendor's recommended solution is to block the access via an NGINX configuration file.
- **CVE-2021-40496**: SAP Internet Communication framework (ICM) - versions 700, 701, 702, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 785, allows an attacker with logon functionality, to exploit the authentication function by using POST and form field to repeat executions of the initial command by a GET request and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can lead to exposure of data like system details.
- **CVE-2021-40497**: SAP BusinessObjects Analysis (edition for OLAP) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to exploit certain application endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation could lead to exposure of some system specific data like its version.
- **CVE-2021-22044**: In Spring Cloud OpenFeign 3.0.0 to 3.0.4, 2.2.0.RELEASE to 2.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions, applications using type-level `@RequestMapping`annotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to `@RequestMapping`-annotated interface methods.
