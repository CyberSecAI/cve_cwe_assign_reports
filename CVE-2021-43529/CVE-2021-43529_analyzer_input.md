# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-43529

## Vulnerability Description
Thunderbird versions prior to 91.3.0 are vulnerable to the **heap overflow** described in CVE-2021-43527 when processing S/MIME messages. Thunderbird versions 91.3.0 and later will not call the vulnerable code when processing S/MIME messages that contain certificates with DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap overflow**
- **product:** Thunderbird
- **version:** prior to 91.3.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the automatic import of S/MIME certificates during the processing of signed emails. The existing certificate verification process in Thunderbird's S/MIME implementation was insufficient, particularly with regard to revocation checking and handling of specific signature algorithms. Specifically, the vulnerability is a result of an insufficient verification process during automatic import of S/MIME certificates. This is coupled with a dependency on the vulnerable code in `decodeECorDsaSignature` as described in CVE-2021-43527.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Certificate Verification:** The classic NSS verification had limitations, especially with revocation checking and proxy configurations.
*   **Missing `mozilla::pkix` Check:** While `mozilla::pkix` was used for initial validity checks of the signing certificate, the automatically imported certificates were not checked with it. This allowed for the potential import of invalid or malicious certificates without proper validation.
*  **Dependence on vulnerable code:** The vulnerability is directly linked to a heap overflow described in CVE-2021-43527 during the processing of DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures in S/MIME messages. Thunderbird was still calling vulnerable code with insufficient certificate verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Processing a specially crafted S/MIME message with maliciously crafted certificates could lead to a heap overflow. This is due to the vulnerable code in `decodeECorDsaSignature` as described in CVE-2021-43527 being called with insufficient verification.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities often have the potential to be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, although that was not the primary focus in this case.
*  **Compromised S/MIME Security:** By importing certificates without proper validation, attackers could undermine the security of S/MIME communications by introducing malicious certificates into the user's trust store. This could enable various attacks, such as impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** The primary attack vector is through email containing S/MIME signed messages that include malicious or invalid certificates, particularly those with DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.
*   **Automatic Certificate Import:** The vulnerability is triggered when Thunderbird automatically imports certificates included within a digitally signed email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the targeted user.
*   **Crafted S/MIME Message:** The attacker needs to be able to create an S/MIME message with malicious certificates, specifically those with DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures that would trigger the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes**

*   The fix involved adding a check using `mozilla::pkix` to verify all automatically imported certificates, thus addressing the insufficient verification.
*   The vulnerability is linked to the memory corruption issue described in CVE-2021-43527.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "sec-critical".
*   The fix was implemented in Thunderbird versions 91.3.0 and later.
*   Versions of Thunderbird prior to 91.3.0 are vulnerable to the heap overflow described in CVE-2021-43527 when processing S/MIME messages.
