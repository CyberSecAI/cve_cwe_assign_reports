# Final Resolution for CVE-2021-32077

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-202** | **Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries** | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| **CWE-306** | **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between **CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries)** and the broader **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)**. Choosing **CWE-202** provided a more specific classification. The relationship between **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)** and its parent **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)** highlights the authentication aspect.mermaid

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**, allowing unauthenticated access to the system. This leads to **CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries)**, where an attacker can then discover Social Security Numbers (SSNs) via a brute-force attack on a search field.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis and criticism both correctly identified **CWE-202** as the primary weakness due to the direct exposure of sensitive information through data queries. The assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description: "allows an anonymous internet user to discover Social Security Number (SSN) values via a brute-force attack on a (sometimes hidden) search field, because the last four SSN digits are part of the supported combination of search selectors". The vulnerability description directly states the ability to "discover Social Security Number (SSN) values" which is strong evidence. The addition of **CWE-306** as a secondary weakness is also valid, as the lack of authentication is a contributing factor. The final selection reflects the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-202** being more specific than its parent **CWE-200**. The confidence score has been slightly increased to 0.95 for **CWE-202** to reflect the strong evidence. The confidence score has been slightly increased to 0.75 for **CWE-306** to reflect acknowledgement of missing authentication as a secondary factor.
