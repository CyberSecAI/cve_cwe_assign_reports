## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability, which is assigned the identifier PSV-2019-0214, and not CVE-2021-45605. However, since the content is indeed a security advisory, here's the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A stack overflow vulnerability is present in the firmware of specific Netgear router models.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The advisory states the CVSS vector indicates a high impact on "Availability" (A:H). While it doesn't explicitly state the impact of exploitation, a stack overflow can lead to denial of service (DoS) by crashing the device, or potentially remote code execution (RCE) depending on exploit details, though RCE is not directly stated here.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local (AV:L). The advisory states it is a post-authentication vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) and needs to have already authenticated to the device. This implies that the attacker would need access to the admin interface, using valid credentials.

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
*   R6400, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.68
*   R7000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.11.116
*   R6900P, firmware versions prior to 1.3.3.140
*   R7000P, firmware versions prior to 1.3.3.140
*   R7900, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.38
*   RAX75, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.102
*   RAX80, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.102
*   XR300, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.50
