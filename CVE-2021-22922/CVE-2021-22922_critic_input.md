# Critic Input for CVE-2021-22922



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file.The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different servers and theclient can then download the file from one or several of them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **download of malicious content**
- **vector:** malicious content in metalink XML file
- **product:** curl
- **component:** metalink feature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-22922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how `curl` handles Metalink files. When a Metalink file specifies multiple URLs for downloading content, `curl` verifies the downloaded content against a hash provided in the Metalink file. However, if a downloaded file from one of the URLs has a hash mismatch, `curl` does not discard the file. Instead, it keeps the potentially malicious content, even though a hash mismatch indicates that it's corrupted/modified, and only mentions the hash mismatch in a text message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** `curl` does not properly validate the integrity of downloaded content when using Metalink. It fails to discard content with mismatched hashes, which could be malicious.
*   **Lack of Automatic Fallback:** Instead of automatically discarding a file with a hash mismatch and attempting download from other URLs in Metalink file, curl stops after receiving the first file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Delivery of malicious content:**  An attacker could potentially compromise one of the servers listed in the Metalink file, replace the legitimate content with malicious content and cause `curl` to download the altered, malicious file, while still displaying a hash mismatch message.
*   **User Misinterpretation:** The user might miss the hash mismatch message and believe that the file is correct.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is not required, the attack can be done by compromising one of the servers hosting the file listed in the Metalink file.
*   The attack vector involves exploiting a flaw in how `curl` processes Metalink files when downloading content from multiple sources specified in the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to compromise at least one of the servers hosting content specified in the Metalink XML file.
*   The attacker needs to be able to replace the legitimate file with a malicious version on the compromised server.
*   The attacker's server must be among the mirrors/locations listed in the Metalink file that `curl` uses.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability exists only in the `curl` tool, not in the `libcurl` library.
*   The vulnerability exists from `curl` version 7.27.0 up to and including 7.77.0.
*   The `curl` project decided to remove Metalink support in version 7.78.0 instead of fixing the issue.
*   The issue is identified as CWE-354, which is "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value."
*   The vulnerability is classified as having medium severity.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the fact that `curl` doesn't properly validate the integrity of the downloaded content when using Metalink. Even when the hash of the downloaded file mismatches the hash provided in the metalink file, `curl` keeps the file. This aligns with CWE-354 (**Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value**). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly identifies CWE-354 as the root cause: "The issue is identified as CWE-354, which is 'Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value.'"
  - The retriever results also suggests CWE-354 but this was based on less information.
  - Additionally, the vulnerability description mentions that the hash mismatch is "only mentioned in text" and the content is kept, which suggests that there is no action taken on the error condition, which can be attributed to CWE-390 (**Detection of Error Condition Without Action**). While the primary issue is the lack of proper validation, the fact that the error is detected but ignored contributes to the vulnerability's impact.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-354 is a Base level weakness, which is the preferred level. While there are child CWEs like CWE-347 (**Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**), the description mentions a general integrity check rather than a cryptographic signature specifically. CWE-354 is related to CWE-345 (**Insufficient Verification of Data Integrity**), which is a parent. CWE-390, the secondary CWE, can precede CWE-401 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) because ignoring the error condition could lead to resource exhaustion if the malicious content is processed further.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials, as well as explicit mention in the CVE details)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms
Memory Leak

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-772
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404
CanFollow -> CWE-390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Choose a language or tool that provides automatic memory management, or makes manual memory management less error-prone.


For example, glibc in Linux provides protection against free of invalid pointers.


When using Xcode to target OS X or iOS, enable automatic reference counting (ARC) [REF-391].


To help correctly and consistently manage memory when programming in C++, consider using a smart pointer class such as std::auto_ptr (defined by ISO/IEC ISO/IEC 14882:2003), std::shared_ptr and std::unique_ptr (specified by an upcoming revision of the C++ standard, informally referred to as C++ 1x), or equivalent solutions such as Boost.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Build and Compilation
- **Description:** The Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector or valgrind can be used to detect leaks in code.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "origin validation" could fall under this.

**[Maintenance]** The specific ways in which the origin is not properly identified should be laid out as separate weaknesses. In some sense, this is more like a category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums



## CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product detects a specific error, but takes no actions to handle the error.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-755
CanPrecede -> CWE-401

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Properly handle each exception. This is the recommended solution. Ensure that all exceptions are handled in such a way that you can be sure of the state of your system at any given moment.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** If a function returns an error, it is important to either fix the problem and try again, alert the user that an error has happened and let the program continue, or alert the user and close and cleanup the program.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Testing
- **Description:** Subject the product to extensive testing to discover some of the possible instances of where/how errors or return values are not handled. Consider testing techniques such as ad hoc, equivalence partitioning, robustness and fault tolerance, mutation, and fuzzing.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21820:** A GPU data center manager detects an error due to a malformed request but does not act on it, leading to memory corruption.



## CWE-354: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or "checksums" of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.

### Extended Description
Improper validation of checksums before use results in an unnecessary risk that can easily be mitigated. The protocol specification describes the algorithm used for calculating the checksum. It is then a simple matter of implementing the calculation and verifying that the calculated checksum and the received checksum match. Improper verification of the calculated checksum and the received checksum can lead to far greater consequences.
