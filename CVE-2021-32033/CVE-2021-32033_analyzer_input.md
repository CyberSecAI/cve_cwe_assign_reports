# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-32033

## Vulnerability Description
Protectimus SLIM NFC 70 10.01 devices allow a **Time Traveler attack** in which attackers can predict TOTP passwords in certain situations. The **time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value** for generating time-based one-time passwords, without authentication. Thus, an attacker with short-time physical access to a device can set the internal real-time clock (RTC) to the future, generate one-time passwords, and reset the clock to the current time. This allows the generation of valid future time-based one-time passwords without having further access to the hardware token.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value**
- **weakness:** **Time Traveler attack**
- **impact:** predict TOTP passwords
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Protectimus SLIM NFC 70
- **version:** 10.01

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32033:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Protectimus SLIM NFC, a reprogrammable TOTP hardware token, has a design flaw that allows the internal real-time clock (RTC) to be set independently of the secret key (seed) used for generating one-time passwords. This is possible without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-15 External Control of System or Configuration Setting:** The primary weakness is that the device allows external, unauthenticated control over its time setting, a critical parameter for generating TOTP.
-  The device lacks proper authentication or authorization controls on the time-setting mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Time Traveler Attack:** An attacker with brief physical access can manipulate the token's RTC by setting it to a future time, generating valid future one-time passwords. The attacker can then reset the clock back to the current time. This allows the attacker to gain valid OTPs without needing continuous access to the physical token.
- By controlling the time, the attacker can essentially predict or create valid OTPs for a chosen time, which would allow them to bypass two-factor authentication that relies on the token.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the Protectimus SLIM NFC hardware token.
- **NFC Interface:** The time is manipulated via the NFC interface, likely using a tool like Proxmark3 and a custom script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Physical Proximity:** An attacker needs short-term physical access to the token.
- **NFC Tooling:** The attacker needs an NFC tool capable of communicating with the token, along with a script (e.g., the provided Lua script for Proxmark3).
- **Technical Knowledge:**  The attacker requires technical knowledge to use the provided script and NFC tooling.
