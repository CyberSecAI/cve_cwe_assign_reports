# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-32033

## Query
Protectimus SLIM NFC 70 10.01 devices allow a Time Traveler attack in which attackers can predict TOTP passwords in certain situations. The time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value for generating time-based one-time passwords, without authentication. Thus, an attacker with short-time physical access to a device can set the internal real-time clock (RTC) to the future, generate one-time passwords, and reset the clock to the current time. This allows the generation of valid future time-based one-time passwords without having further access to the hardware token.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value
- **weakness**: Time Traveler attack
