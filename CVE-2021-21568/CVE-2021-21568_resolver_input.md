# Resolution Input for CVE-2021-21568

## Vulnerability Description
Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.2.x contain an insufficient logging vulnerability. An authenticated user with ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI could make un-audited and un-trackable configuration changes to settings that their roles have privileges to change.

## Initial Analysis
# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-778 | Insufficient Logging | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it. |
| CWE-280 | Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**insufficient logging**" issue, which directly maps to CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by highlighting "**Insufficient Logging**" as a key weakness. An authenticated user with specific privileges can make configuration changes without these changes being properly audited or tracked, leading to a lack of accountability. The CWE-778 description precisely matches this scenario: "When a security-critical event occurs, the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it." The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-778 indicates it is ALLOWED, further solidifying its appropriateness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-778 is a base-level CWE. While it has child CWEs, they are less relevant to the core issue of missing or incomplete logging. There are no direct relationships that significantly influence the mapping decision in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is considered as a secondary CWE. While the primary issue is the lack of logging, the fact that users with "ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI" can make unauthorized configuration changes *suggests* that privilege handling might also be a contributing factor. If the logging were more robust, such changes might be detected and prevented, highlighting a potential issue with how permissions are managed in conjunction with logging. However, the primary **rootcause** identified remains the **insufficient logging**. The retriever result also supports this with a score of 0.6957.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-280 is a base-level CWE and is related to access control issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (There is some evidence to support, but it is less direct than the evidence supporting CWE-778.)

## Criticism
Okay, let's review the analysis with the full CWE specifications, focusing on mapping guidance and mitigations.

**Overall Assessment:**

The analysis is generally well-reasoned and the choice of CWE-778 as the primary weakness is correct and justified. The inclusion of CWE-280 as a secondary weakness is less compelling, but not entirely incorrect. The confidence scores assigned are appropriate.

**Detailed Review:**

**CWE-778: Insufficient Logging (Primary CWE)**

*   **Mapping Justification:** The justification is excellent. The description directly states "insufficient logging," and the impact aligns perfectly with the CWE description.  The MITRE mapping guidance confirms it's `Allowed`.
*   **Confidence Score:** The 0.95 confidence score is appropriate given the directness of the vulnerability description and the corroborating information.
*   **Mitigations:** The provided mitigations in the CWE specification are relevant.  Mitigation 1 (centralized logging) is a good architectural approach. Mitigation 2 (ensuring security-related events are logged) is directly applicable.  Mitigation 3 (setting the level of logging appropriately) highlights the importance of balancing detail and performance overhead.

**CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges (Secondary CWE)**

*   **Mapping Justification:** This is where the analysis is weaker, although defensible. The reasoning is that insufficient logging *could* mask privilege-related issues and that if the logging were more robust, such changes might be detected and prevented, highlighting a potential issue with how permissions are managed in conjunction with logging.  This is an *indirect* relationship. The core problem isn't that the system mishandles privileges directly, but rather that the *lack of logging* allows potential improper privilege handling to go unnoticed. It's a resultant effect more than a root cause in this particular case.
*   **Confidence Score:** A confidence score of 0.6 is fair. The connection to the primary weakness is indirect, and the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention privilege handling errors.
*   **Mitigations:** The mitigations provided in the CWE specification for CWE-280 are relevant *in general* to systems with privilege management. Mitigation 1 (separation of privilege) is a good design principle. Mitigation 2 (checking for successful resource access) is a good practice, *but* doesn't directly address the root cause of the insufficient logging. In this case they would just be good security practices to follow.

**Improvements and Alternative Considerations:**

1.  **CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information:** Considering the nature of logging and configuration changes made by users, the choice of CWE-223 may be a good replacement for CWE-280. This would have a better relationship to CWE-778, as the configuration changes are the security-relevant information that is omitted.

2.  **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:** This could be an alternative to CWE-280, if the root cause was found to be an overly permissive resource (i.e. a configuration file). In this case, the user with ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI could make unauthorised changes because of the misconfigured resource.

3.  **CWE-285: Improper Authorization:** This could be an alternative to CWE-280, if the system did not correctly perform an authorisation check when a user tried to make a configuration change. In this case, the user with ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI could be making changes they shouldn't be making.

4.  **Specificity:** The analysis could be slightly improved by specifying *what* is not being logged. Is it the user who made the change? The specific setting that was modified? The timestamp? Providing this level of detail would make the CWE-778 mapping even more precise and assist with remediation.

**Conclusion:**

The analysis is sound, with a good understanding of the primary weakness. The choice of CWE-280 as a secondary weakness is weaker but not incorrect. The confidence scores reflect the strength of the evidence. Considering the alternative suggestions and increased specificity could improve the analysis further.
