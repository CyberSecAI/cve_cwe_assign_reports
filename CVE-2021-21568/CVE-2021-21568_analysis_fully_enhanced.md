# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-21568

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-778 | Insufficient Logging | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it. |
| CWE-280 | Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states an "**insufficient logging**" issue, which directly maps to CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by highlighting "**Insufficient Logging**" as a key weakness. An authenticated user with specific privileges can make configuration changes without these changes being properly audited or tracked, leading to a lack of accountability. The CWE-778 description precisely matches this scenario: "When a security-critical event occurs, the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it." The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-778 indicates it is ALLOWED, further solidifying its appropriateness.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-778 is a base-level CWE. While it has child CWEs, they are less relevant to the core issue of missing or incomplete logging. There are no direct relationships that significantly influence the mapping decision in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is considered as a secondary CWE. While the primary issue is the lack of logging, the fact that users with "ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI" can make unauthorized configuration changes *suggests* that privilege handling might also be a contributing factor. If the logging were more robust, such changes might be detected and prevented, highlighting a potential issue with how permissions are managed in conjunction with logging. However, the primary **rootcause** identified remains the **insufficient logging**. The retriever result also supports this with a score of 0.6957.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-280 is a base-level CWE and is related to access control issues.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.6 (There is some evidence to support, but it is less direct than the evidence supporting CWE-778.)



## Known Examples for CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0501** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0501](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0501): Special file system allows attackers to prevent ownership/permission change of certain entries by opening the entries before calling a setuid program.
- **CVE-2004-0148** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0148](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0148): FTP server places a user in the root directory when the user's permissions prevent access to the their own home directory.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-26195**: Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.1.2 â€“ 9.1.0 contain an issue where the OneFS SMB directory auto-create may erroneously create a directory for a user. A remote unauthenticated attacker may take advantage of this issue to slow down the system.
- **CVE-2021-37175**: A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM ROX MX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1400 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1500 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1501 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1510 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1511 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1512 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1524 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX1536 (All versions < V2.14.1), RUGGEDCOM ROX RX5000 (All versions < V2.14.1). The affected devices do not properly handle permissions to traverse the file system. If exploited, an attacker could gain access to an overview of the complete file system on the affected devices.
- **CVE-2022-39885**: Improper access control vulnerability in BootCompletedReceiver_CMCC in DeviceManagement prior to SMR Nov-2022 Release 1 allows local attacker to access to Device information.
- **CVE-2022-39886**: Improper access control vulnerability in IpcRxServiceModeBigDataInfo in RIL prior to SMR Nov-2022 Release 1 allows local attacker to access Device information.
- **CVE-2022-21813**: NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel driver, where improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges may allow an unprivileged local user limited write access to protected memory, which can lead to denial of service.
- **CVE-2022-21814**: NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel driver package, where improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges may allow an unprivileged local user limited write access to protected memory, which can lead to denial of service.
- **CVE-2022-22300**: A improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges in Fortinet FortiAnalyzer version 5.6.0 through 5.6.11, FortiAnalyzer version 6.0.0 through 6.0.11, FortiAnalyzer version 6.2.0 through 6.2.9, FortiAnalyzer version 6.4.0 through 6.4.7, FortiAnalyzer version 7.0.0 through 7 .0.2, FortiManager version 5.6.0 through 5.6.11, FortiManager version 6.0.0 through 6.0.11, FortiManager version 6.2.0 through 6.2.9, FortiManager version 6.4.0 through 6.4.7, FortiManager version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2 allows attacker to bypass the device policy and force the password-change action for its user.
- **CVE-2022-34368**: Dell EMC NetWorker 19.2.1.x 19.3.x, 19.4.x, 19.5.x, 19.6.x and 19.7.0.0 contain an Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges vulnerability. Authenticated non admin user could exploit this vulnerability and gain access to restricted resources.
