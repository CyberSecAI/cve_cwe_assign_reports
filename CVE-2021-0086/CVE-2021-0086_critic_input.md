# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
**Observable response discrepancy in floating-point operations** for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Observable response discrepancy in floating-point operations**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **attacker:** authorized user
- **product:** Intel(R) Processors

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0086:

**CVE-2021-0086** is related to **Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI)**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a microarchitectural behavior in some CPUs where speculative execution of floating point operations may lead to type confusion in registers, potentially leaking data. Specifically, it involves observable response discrepancies in floating-point operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Speculative Execution:** Modern processors speculatively execute instructions, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the speculation is based on incorrect or attacker-controlled data. In this case, the vulnerability exists due to transient execution behavior of floating-point operations.
- **Type Confusion:** During speculative execution, the processor may misinterpret the type of data in registers. This can result in a state where, even though the outcome of the operation is discarded, the transient state can leak data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially infer the contents of arbitrary host memory, including memory assigned to other guests in a virtualized environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, requiring an authorized user on the system. The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target CPU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authorized user with the ability to execute code on the targeted system.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence floating point operations and observe their results.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is related to, but distinct from, "Speculative Code Store Bypass" (SCSB).
- Xen is believed to be not vulnerable to FPVI. This is because, although Xen on x86 emulates floating-point operations, it does not have subsequent control flow dependent on the transient or otherwise results of the operation.
- Intel recommends following certain guidelines in software, such as process isolation and avoiding NaN-boxing techniques.

The provided content details the nature of the FPVI vulnerability, its potential impact, and that it was discovered alongside the SCSB vulnerability. The information is consistent with and expands upon the official CVE description. It also notes that Xen itself is considered not vulnerable to FPVI, even though the underlying hardware is susceptible.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an "**Observable response discrepancy in floating-point operations**," which aligns well with CWE-205 (Observable Behavioral Discrepancy). The core issue is that floating-point operations behave in an inconsistent way, observable to an attacker. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights that speculative execution leads to type confusion and data leakage, further supporting the observability aspect. CWE-205 is a base level CWE and is ALLOWED, making it a suitable choice. Other CWEs like CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) are similar, but less general than CWE-205.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-205 is a child of CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy), indicating a broader category. CWE-205 is preferred as it directly captures the behavioral aspect of the discrepancy. While timing is a component, the primary issue is not just timing, but also the observable difference in behavior based on the internal state of the processor due to speculative execution. CWE-205 can precede CWE-514 (Covert Channel), as the observable discrepancy could potentially be exploited to create a covert channel for information leakage.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Based on the direct match of the vulnerability description and CVE details with the CWE definition.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1420 (Exposure of Sensitive Information during Transient Execution) is a strong candidate because the vulnerability involves speculative execution leading to potential data leakage. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary specifically mentions speculative execution and the potential for information disclosure, which aligns directly with CWE-1420. The "Transient Execution" aspect is key to this vulnerability. However, CWE-1420 is marked as "Allowed-with-Review". Given that CWE-205 is a more encompassing and direct match to the observable discrepancy, CWE-1420 serves as a secondary CWE to highlight the transient execution aspect of the vulnerability.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1420 doesn't have explicit relationships listed. It's closely related to the broader category of speculative execution vulnerabilities. The graph scores are fairly high for this CWE.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium confidence as it captures the transient execution aspect, but CWE-205 better reflects the core observable discrepancy.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) is a weaker candidate. While timing differences might be present in floating-point operations, the core of the vulnerability is the observable behavioral difference, not strictly the timing. The primary observable difference is the output, which may expose information. If the vulnerability were strictly about timing differences revealing information, CWE-208 would be more appropriate.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-208 is related to CWE-205, where behavioral discrepancies can often manifest as timing discrepancies. It is a base level CWE and is ALLOWED.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.50 (Low confidence as timing discrepancy is not the primary characteristic.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.


If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.


Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.

## CWE-1420: Exposure of Sensitive Information during Transient Execution
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A processor event or prediction may allow incorrect operations (or correct operations with incorrect data) to execute transiently, potentially exposing data over a covert channel.

### Extended Description


When operations execute but do not commit to the processor's architectural state, this is commonly referred to as transient execution. This behavior can occur when the processor mis-predicts an outcome (such as a branch target), or when a processor event (such as an exception or microcode assist, etc.) is handled after younger operations have already executed. Operations that execute transiently may exhibit observable discrepancies (CWE-203) in covert channels [REF-1400] such as data caches. Observable discrepancies of this kind can be detected and analyzed using timing or power analysis techniques, which may allow an attacker to infer information about the operations that executed transiently. For example, the attacker may be able to infer confidential data that was accessed or used by those operations.


Transient execution weaknesses may be exploited using one of two methods. In the first method, the attacker generates a code sequence that exposes data through a covert channel when it is executed transiently (the attacker must also be able to trigger transient execution). Some transient execution weaknesses can only expose data that is accessible within the attacker's processor context. For example, an attacker executing code in a software sandbox may be able to use a transient execution weakness to expose data within the same address space, but outside of the attacker's sandbox. Other transient execution weaknesses can expose data that is architecturally inaccessible, that is, data protected by hardware-enforced boundaries such as page tables or privilege rings. These weaknesses are the subject of CWE-1421.


In the second exploitation method, the attacker first identifies a code sequence in a victim program that, when executed transiently, can expose data that is architecturally accessible within the victim's processor context. For instance, the attacker may search the victim program for code sequences that resemble a bounds-check bypass sequence (see Demonstrative Example 1). If the attacker can trigger a mis-prediction of the conditional branch and influence the index of the out-of-bounds array access, then the attacker may be able to infer the value of out-of-bounds data by monitoring observable discrepancies in a covert channel.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Description:** The hardware designer can attempt to prevent transient execution from causing observable discrepancies in specific covert channels.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Effectiveness:** Moderate
- **Description:** 

Processor designers may expose instructions or other architectural features that allow software to mitigate the effects of transient execution, but without disabling predictors. These features may also help to limit opportunities for data exposure.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Effectiveness:** Limited
- **Description:** 

Processor designers may expose registers (for example, control registers or model-specific registers) that allow privileged and/or user software to disable specific predictors or other hardware features that can cause confidential data to be exposed during transient execution.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2017-5753:** Microarchitectural conditional branch predictors may allow operations to execute transiently after a misprediction, potentially exposing data over a covert channel.
- **CVE-2021-0089:** A machine clear triggered by self-modifying code may allow incorrect operations to execute transiently, potentially exposing data over a covert channel.
- **CVE-2022-0002:** Microarchitectural indirect branch predictors may allow incorrect operations to execute transiently after a misprediction, potentially exposing data over a covert channel.



## CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.

### Extended Description
Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

- **CVE-2002-0208:** Product modifies TCP/IP stack and ICMP error messages in unusual ways that show the product is in use.
- **CVE-2004-2252:** Behavioral infoleak by responding to SYN-FIN packets.



## CWE-514: Covert Channel
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A covert channel is a path that can be used to transfer information in a way not intended by the system's designers.

### Extended Description
Typically the system has not given authorization for the transmission and has no knowledge of its occurrence.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1229
CanFollow -> CWE-205
ParentOf -> CWE-385
ParentOf -> CWE-515

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A covert channel can be thought of as an emergent resource, meaning that it was not an originally intended resource, however it exists due the application's behaviors.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.





## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
Side Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.
- **CVE-2019-14353:** Crypto hardware wallet's power consumption relates to total number of pixels illuminated, creating a side channel in the USB connection that allows attackers to determine secrets displayed such as PIN numbers and passwords
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies



## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.
