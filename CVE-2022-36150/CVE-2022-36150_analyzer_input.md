# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-36150

## Vulnerability Description
tifig v0.2.2 was discovered to contain a **heap-buffer overflow** via __asan_memmove at /asan/asan_interceptors_memintrinsics.cpp.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-buffer overflow**
- **product:** tifig
- **version:** v0.2.2
- **component:** __asan_memmove at /asan/asan_interceptors_memintrinsics.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap buffer overflow in the `__asan_memmove` function, triggered during a vector insert operation within the `BitStream::read8BitsArray` function, ultimately caused by a large size parameter in the vulnerable code path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap buffer overflow. The issue arises when copying data into a vector, where the size of the data to be copied exceeds the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Program crash due to heap corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a crafted input file, specifically a HEIF image with a large size value in a particular field, an attacker can trigger the heap buffer overflow. The provided command line suggests the `-p` and `-v` flags may play a role, although not fully explained.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HEIF file as input to the vulnerable program (`tifig`). The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is reachable by any user able to run the vulnerable tool on a malicious file.
