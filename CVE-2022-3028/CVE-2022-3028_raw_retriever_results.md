# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-3028

## Query
A race condition was found in the Linux kernels IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: race condition
