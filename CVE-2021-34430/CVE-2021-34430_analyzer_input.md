# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-34430

## Vulnerability Description
Eclipse TinyDTLS through 0.9-rc1 relies on the rand function in the C library, which makes it easier for remote attackers to compute the master key and then decrypt DTLS traffic.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reliance on rand function**
- **impact:** decrypt DTLS traffic
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** Eclipse TinyDTLS
- **version:** through 0.9-rc1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34430:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2021-34430. It describes a vulnerability in the TinyDTLS library, which is the subject of the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- TinyDTLS uses the standard library's `rand()` function as its pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) after seeding it with entropy from `/dev/urandom`.
- The `rand()` function, typically a linear congruential generator (LCG) or similar, has predictable output based on its internal state.
- The `dtls_prng` function in TinyDTLS, which uses `rand()`, produces a sequence of pseudo-random bytes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure PRNG:** Using `rand()` is not cryptographically secure. The output of `rand()` is predictable if its internal state is known.
- **State Exposure:**  The `server_random` (and `client_random`) values in the DTLS handshake are derived from the output of the insecure PRNG, revealing parts of its state.
- **Small State Size:**  The internal state of `rand()` in many standard libraries (like glibc) is small (around 32 bits), making it easier to brute force.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Secret Key Recovery:** An attacker can observe the `server_random` value, use this to recover the internal state of the PRNG, and then predict the secret scalar used for elliptic curve calculations.
- **Compromised Communication:** By knowing the secret scalar, an attacker can derive symmetric keys, compromising the entire DTLS communication. This allows them to intercept, decrypt and potentially modify encrypted communication.
- **Both Client and Server Vulnerable:** The attack works for both client-side and server-side of the DTLS connection if either side is using TinyDTLS.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Passive Observation:** The attacker needs to passively observe a DTLS handshake to obtain the `server_random` value.
- **Local/Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can be local or remote as long as they can intercept the network traffic.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Sniffing:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic in order to capture the handshake, particularly the `server_random` value.
- **Computational Power:** The attacker needs some computational power to brute-force the PRNG state. However, the described exploit shows this is not a high bar (0.014 seconds on the reporter's CPU).
- **Knowledge of TinyDTLS implementation:** An attacker would need knowledge of the vulnerable implementation and the details on how it uses the PRNG function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content mentions that increasing the seed value width does not resolve the vulnerability. The internal state is still predictable even with a larger initial seed value.
- The report provides an attached exploit code along with a network dump to test against.
- The report also highlights the need for a cryptographically secure PRNG (CSPRNG) or to directly read bytes from `/dev/urandom` as a solution.
