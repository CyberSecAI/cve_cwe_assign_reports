# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-33438

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in mjs (mJS Restricted JavaScript engine), ES6 (JavaScript version 6). There is **stack buffer overflow** in json_parse_array() in mjs.c.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**
- **product:** mjs
- **component:** json_parse_array() in mjs.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a stack buffer overflow in the `json_parse_array()` function within the `mjs.c` file of the mjs (mJS: Restricted JavaScript engine) project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `json_parse_array()` function is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow. This occurs when the function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. By triggering the stack overflow, an attacker can cause the program to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to execute the vulnerable code.
*   **Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted file, which contains malicious JSON data that causes the `json_parse_array()` function to write beyond the stack buffer boundaries. The specific file is mentioned as being located at `https://github.com/Clingto/POC/blob/master/MSA/mjs/mjs-5fb78-json_parse_array-stack-overflow`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable mjs application.
*   The attacker needs to have a malicious crafted file that will cause the overflow when parsed by the `json_parse_array()` function.
