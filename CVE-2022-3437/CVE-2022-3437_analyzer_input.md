# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-3437

## Vulnerability Description
A **heap-based buffer overflow** vulnerability was found in Samba within the GSSAPI unwrap_des() and unwrap_des3() routines of Heimdal. The DES and Triple-DES decryption routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited **write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory** when presented with a maliciously small packet. This flaw allows a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the application, possibly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory**
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** specially crafted malicious data
- **attacker:** remote user
- **product:** Samba
- **component:** GSSAPI unwrap_des() and unwrap_des3() routines of Heimdal

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-3437:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Heimdal GSSAPI library, specifically in the `unwrap_des()` and `unwrap_des3()` routines used for DES and Triple-DES decryption. These routines are part of the Heimdal Kerberos implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The decryption routines allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on memory allocated with `malloc()`. This occurs when processing a maliciously small packet, leading to writing beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can send specially crafted malicious data that triggers the buffer overflow. This can crash the vulnerable application, leading to a DoS.
*  **Potential for Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap-based buffer overflows can be leveraged for remote code execution under certain circumstances, though this is not the primary impact listed. The description focuses on DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending a malicious network packet to a service that uses Heimdal for GSSAPI operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable service or application.
*   **Ability to Send Malicious Packets:**  The attacker must be able to craft and send a malicious packet that triggers the vulnerability during the decryption process.
*  **Low privileges:** The attacker can be a user with low privileges.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of Samba since 4.0 compiled with Heimdal Kerberos are affected. Samba is vulnerable if it uses its internal Heimdal Kerberos library (which is the default). If Samba is compiled to use the system MIT Kerberos library (using the `--with-system-mitkrb5` argument), it is not affected.
* **Affected Use Cases:** Samba can use GSSAPI for SMB1 (unix extensions), DCE/RPC, and LDAP in Active Directory Domain Controller setups.
*  **Samba versions 4.15.11, 4.16.6, and 4.17.2** contain fixes for this vulnerability.
*   The single-DES use case and the equally vulnerable `unwrap_des()` are only compiled into Samba 4.11 and earlier.
*   **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)

**Summary**
CVE-2022-3437 describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Heimdal GSSAPI library's DES and Triple-DES decryption routines, specifically affecting Samba when compiled with the internal Heimdal library. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a maliciously crafted packet, potentially leading to denial of service. The vulnerability is addressed in updated versions of Samba.
