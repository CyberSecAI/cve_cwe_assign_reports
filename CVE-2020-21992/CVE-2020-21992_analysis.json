  "description": "Inim Electronics SmartLiving SmartLAN/G/SI <=6.x suffers from an authenticated remote command injection vulnerability. The issue exist due to the par POST parameter not being sanitized when called with the testemail module through web.cgi binary. The vulnerable CGI binary (ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM) is calling the sh executable via the system() function to issue a command using the mailx service and its vulnerable string format parameter allowing for OS command injection with root privileges. An attacker can remotely execute system commands as the root user using default credentials and bypass access controls in place.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21992:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies in the `web.cgi` binary of Inim Electronics SmartLiving SmartLAN devices. Specifically, the `testemail` module within this binary is vulnerable.\n*   The `par` POST parameter, when used with the `testemail` module, is not properly sanitized.\n*   The `web.cgi` binary (an ARM executable) uses the `system()` function to execute commands via the `mailx` service.\n*   A format string vulnerability in how `mailx` is used allows for OS command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Remote Command Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `par` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a `system()` call.\n*   **Use of `system()`:** The use of `system()` with unsanitized input is a classic security risk.\n*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The manner in which mailx is called allows for format string exploitation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the vulnerable device with root privileges.\n*   **Full System Access:**  Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control of the device.\n*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** Default credentials can be used to bypass access restrictions.\n*   **Potential DoS:** Although the primary impact is RCE, DoS is also listed as an impact.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over HTTP/HTTPS.\n*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker sends a POST request to the `web.cgi` with the `mod=testemail` parameter.\n*   **`par` Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious OS commands into the `par` parameter, which are executed when the `system()` function is called by the vulnerable code.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device (SmartLAN).\n*   **Authentication Credentials:** The attacker requires valid credentials for the web interface. The exploit code indicates that default credentials such as `user=admin;pass=pass;code=9999` can be used.\n\n**Additional Technical Details:**\n\n*   The `web.cgi` binary is an ELF 32-bit LSB executable for ARM architecture.\n*   The vulnerable code calls `snprintf` to construct the command string, incorporating the attacker-controlled `par` parameter.\n*   The assembled command string passed to `system()` looks something like this: `sh -c echo \"Hello!\" | mailx -s \"Email test\" <injected-command>`.\n*   The vulnerability is triggered due to the `mailx` command usage which allows for format string injection.\n\n**Affected Devices:**\n\n*   SmartLiving 505\n*   SmartLiving 515\n*   SmartLiving 1050, SmartLiving 1050/G3\n*   SmartLiving 10100L, SmartLiving10100L/G3\n*   SmartLAN/SI and SmartLAN/G boards\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nThe Ubuntu security notice explicitly states: \"Does not apply to software found in Ubuntu.\" This indicates that while the CVE is registered, the vulnerability does not affect any software within Ubuntu's repositories, it's an issue with the embedded device firmware.\n\nThe provided exploit script, `smartlan_exploit.sh`, clearly demonstrates the exploitation process by sending a crafted POST request containing the malicious command within the `par` parameter.\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic of Zero Science Lab.",

  "criticism": "Okay, I've reviewed the analysis against the full CWE specifications provided. Here's a detailed critique:\n\n**Overall Assessment**\n\nThe analysis correctly identifies CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) as the primary weakness.  It also appropriately includes CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Data) as a secondary CWE related to the root cause. The confidence levels assigned are reasonable. The explanations are clear and justifiable.\n\n**Detailed Critique:**\n\n**1. CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**\n\n*   **CWE Score:** Correct Mapping. The provided analysis makes a strong case for CWE-78 as the primary vulnerability.\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   The description explicitly states \"command injection\" and \"par POST parameter not being sanitized.\" This maps directly to the core concept of CWE-78. The vulnerability enables arbitrary OS command execution.\n    *   The use of `system()` is also directly indicative of OS Command Injection.\n    *   The exploit description confirms this by showing how malicious commands are injected into the `par` parameter and then executed.\n*   **CWE Mapping Guidance Review:** The analysis correctly states that the MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-78 for OS command injection vulnerabilities.\n*   **CWE Relationships:** The analysis correctly notes the relationship between CWE-78, CWE-77, and CWE-74, positioning CWE-78 as a more specific child of the other more general CWEs. Also the potential of privilege escalation linking to CWE-269.\n*   **Potential Mitigations:** The analysis appropriately suggests the use of library calls instead of external processes, statically created external commands, or strong input validation as potential mitigations. The mitigations are directly applicable to the vulnerability described.\n*   **Confidence:** The confidence level of 1.0 is well-justified given the clear evidence and direct alignment with the CWE description.\n\n**2. CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**\n\n*   **CWE Score:** The Analysis appropriately added the CWE, however is some what missunderstood here.\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   The explanation notes the \"par POST parameter not being sanitized\" and \"improper encoding of data.\" This is linked to the command injection.\n    *   Lack of sanitization can be seen as a failure to properly encode or escape the input before using it in the `system()` call.\n*   **CWE Mapping Guidance Review:**\n    *   The analysis correctly notes that the MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-116, but advises caution as it is a class-level CWE.\n    *   \"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\" from the CWE Specification isn't really explored or considered.\n*   **CWE Relationships:** The analysis correctly states that CWE-116 is a class-level CWE, and its children may be more specific.\n*   **Potential Mitigations:** The analysis appropriately suggests libraries, frameworks, or parameterization as mitigations. The MITRE guidances in the CWE specifications could be more clearly referenced to provide support for this.\n*   **Confidence:** The confidence level of 0.75 is reasonable, and is correct to include the phrase \"with review\". There is appropriate base children CWE to this that may provide more accurate mappings.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n*   **CWE-116 Alternatives:** The specification says \"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\". While it is true that improper encoding is the root cause, it might be worthwhile to consider more specific children of CWE-116. One potentially more accurate CWE would be \"CWE-1287: Specified Type\". As we know the content of the par POST parameter is not validated as a \"string\" then this could be a better fit.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** While privilege escalation is mentioned, a direct CWE mapping isn't provided. A more detailed analysis of the root cause of the privilege escalation. Because in this situation, the process runs as root, so there is no privilege escalation.\n\n**Revised Summary Table**\n\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves injecting OS commands via unsanitized input, directly matching CWE-78. |\n| CWE-1287 | Specified Type | 0.75 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE: The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the POST parameter, the data was not validated based on type requirements. |\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe initial analysis provides a strong and accurate assessment of the vulnerability. By adjusting CWE-116 for CWE-1287 a more accurate analysis can be made and will provide better details for remediation.",
  "resolution": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability involves injecting OS commands via unsanitized input, directly matching CWE-78. |\n| CWE-1287 | Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the POST parameter; the data was not validated based on type requirements. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**), which is a base-level CWE. It's more specific than its parent CWE-77 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**) and grandparent CWE-74 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements**). The secondary CWE is CWE-1287 (**Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input**), which is also a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**). The relationship shows that the lack of proper input validation (CWE-1287) leads to OS command injection (CWE-78).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1287\n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe1287 secondary\n    class cwe20,cwe77, cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **par POST parameter not being sanitized**, which is a failure of input validation (**ROOTCAUSE: CWE-1287**). This allows an attacker to inject special elements into the OS command. When the `system()` function is called, the injected commands are executed, resulting in OS command injection (**WEAKNESS: CWE-78**). The impact is the ability to remotely execute system commands as the root user, bypassing access controls.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies CWE-78 as the primary weakness due to the OS command injection. The criticism suggests replacing CWE-116 with CWE-1287, which is a more accurate representation of the root cause which is the lack of input validation for the type of the input. This is supported by the vulnerability description which states the **par POST parameter is not sanitized**.\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-1287 leads to CWE-78.\n\nThe final decision is to classify the vulnerability as CWE-78 (primary) and CWE-1287 (secondary). This provides a more complete picture of the vulnerability, from root cause to impact, and is supported by both the vulnerability description and the CWE relationships. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they are both base-level CWEs.",
