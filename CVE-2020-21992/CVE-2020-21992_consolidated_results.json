  "query": "Inim Electronics SmartLiving SmartLAN/G/SI <=6.x suffers from an authenticated remote command injection vulnerability. The issue exist due to the par POST parameter not being sanitized when called with the testemail module through web.cgi binary. The vulnerable CGI binary (ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM) is calling the sh executable via the system() function to issue a command using the mailx service and its vulnerable string format parameter allowing for OS command injection with root privileges. An attacker can remotely execute system commands as the root user using default credentials and bypass access controls in place.",
