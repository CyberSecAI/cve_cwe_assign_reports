# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-46527

## Vulnerability Description
Cesanta MJS v2.20.0 was discovered to contain a **heap buffer overflow** via mjs_get_cstring at src/mjs_string.c.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **product:** Cesanta MJS
- **version:** v2.20.0
- **component:** mjs_get_cstring at src/mjs_string.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `mjs_get_cstring` function within `src/mjs_string.c` at line 213. This likely stems from improper bounds checking or memory allocation when handling C strings in the mJS JavaScript engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `mjs_get_cstring` function attempts to read beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The program crashes due to the heap-buffer-overflow, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the overflow and overwrite relevant memory regions, although this requires further analysis and exploit development.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by loading and executing specially crafted JavaScript code. The provided `poc.js` demonstrates how to trigger the overflow by exploiting specific function calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious javascript file to the mjs engine. The given example shows how a carefully crafted javascript file can trigger the heap overflow.

**Additional details:**
- The AddressSanitizer output pinpoints the exact location of the heap-buffer-overflow within the `mjs_get_cstring` function and provides details about the memory location, which is `0x60f000000203`.
- The stack trace shows that the vulnerability is triggered through the `mjs_load` function which is triggered during the execution of the javascript code.
- The vulnerability was found by the OWL337 team.
