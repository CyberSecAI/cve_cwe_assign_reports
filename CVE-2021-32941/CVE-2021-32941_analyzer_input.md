# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-32941

## Vulnerability Description
Annke N48PBB (Network Video Recorder) products of version 3.4.106 build 200422 and prior are vulnerable to a stack-based **buffer overflow**, which allows an unauthorized remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the server user (root).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **buffer overflow**
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the server user (root)
- **attacker:** unauthorized remote attacker
- **product:** Annke N48PBB (Network Video Recorder) products
- **version:** 3.4.106 build 200422 and prior

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The affected Annke N48PBB Network Video Recorder (NVR) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. This means that a specially crafted input can overwrite memory on the stack, potentially leading to control of program execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the server user (root). This can lead to complete system compromise, including access to sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, and the vulnerability can be triggered by network traffic without requiring any prior authentication. The attack complexity is low.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable NVR. They do not need any credentials or prior access to the device.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions V3.4.106 build 200422 and prior of the N48PBB NVR.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 9.4 (Critical).
*   The vulnerability was reported by Andrea Palanca from Nozomi Networks.
*   The affected product is deployed worldwide.
*   Annke recommends updating to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability. CISA also provides general mitigations for control systems.
