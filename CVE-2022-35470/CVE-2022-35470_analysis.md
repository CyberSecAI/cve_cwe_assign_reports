## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**heap-buffer overflow**" in OTFCC v0.10.4. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** as a "**heap buffer overflow**" where code attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This aligns directly with CWE-122, which is defined as "A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory." The provided information strongly supports the selection of CWE-122.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a Variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a broader category, the explicit mention of "heap" makes CWE-122 a more precise and appropriate classification. It is also a ParentOf CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), but the description is specific to a heap overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
