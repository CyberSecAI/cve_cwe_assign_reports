- **rootcause:** **lack of a certain sq_reservestack call**
- **weakness:** **Heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** SQUIRREL
- **version:** 3.2
- **component:** sqbaselib.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-30292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing `sq_reservestack` call within the `thread_call` function located in `sqbaselib.cpp` of the Squirrel scripting language.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The lack of stack reservation via `sq_reservestack` before manipulating the stack within the `thread_call` function can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when the function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A heap overflow can cause a crash or make the application unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential Sandbox Escape and Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially escape sandboxes in applications using Squirrel and achieve arbitrary code execution, although this is not definitively stated and may depend on how the scripting language is used in the target application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Squirrel bytecode/source files:** Exploitation requires running specially crafted Squirrel bytecode or source files, which contains malicious code to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Delivery through application:** This malicious code can be delivered to a target system through various means, including:
  - Server-sent game maps containing malicious Squirrel scripts.
  - Malicious game mods.
- **Unspecified user interaction:** The provided content does not specify if user interaction is always needed, but it can be triggered by a server that sends data to the client or through a game mod

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to supply malicious squirrel code:** The attacker needs to be able to inject or have a way for the vulnerable application to execute crafted Squirrel bytecode or source code. This can be done by an attacker who controls a server or by an attacker providing malicious game mods.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes mentions of fixes in Fedora updates for the `squirrel` package and `supertux` (a game that uses Squirrel), confirming that the vulnerability is actively being addressed in real-world applications.
- The commit link provided shows the actual fix of adding a call to `sq_reservestack` within the `thread_call` function.
- The vulnerability is described as being present in Squirrel version 3.2 and below, so a fix would be required for older versions of this library.

This detailed breakdown should provide a clear understanding of CVE-2022-30292.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **heap-based buffer overflow** due to the **lack of a certain sq_reservestack call**. This perfectly matches the description of CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), a Variant-level CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further reinforces this by stating that the lack of stack reservation via `sq_reservestack` before manipulating the stack can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a broader Class-level CWE, CWE-122 provides a more specific classification. The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-122. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-122 indicates this is ALLOWED for heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The root cause, a missing `sq_reservestack` call, relates to CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size), as reserving the stack involves calculating the required buffer size. CWE-122 can lead to impacts such as Denial of Service (DoS) and potential arbitrary code execution, as stated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (Strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description mentions that the root cause is a **lack of a certain sq_reservestack call**. This suggests that the buffer size calculation is either missing or incorrect, which falls under CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size). This weakness is a contributing factor that leads to the heap-based buffer overflow. CWE-131 is a Base-level CWE and the MITRE mapping guidance states that it is ALLOWED. This explains why the heap is too small."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) CanPrecede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and is a ChildOf CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). It directly contributes to the primary weakness, CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), by leading to insufficient memory allocation on the heap."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.75 (Sufficient evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)

- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
ParentOf -> CWE-467

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When allocating a buffer for the purpose of transforming, converting, or encoding an input, allocate enough memory to handle the largest possible encoding. For example, in a routine that converts "&" characters to "&amp;" for HTML entity encoding, the output buffer needs to be at least 5 times as large as the input buffer.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** 

Understand the programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, "not-a-number" calculations, and how the language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. [REF-7]


Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This is a broad category. Some examples include:


  - simple math errors,

  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,

  - not accounting for size differences when "transforming" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. "expansion").

This level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.

**[Maintenance]** 

This weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.


This issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed
- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables



## CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.

### Extended Description
When product performs a security-critical calculation incorrectly, it might lead to incorrect resource allocations, incorrect privilege assignments, or failed comparisons among other things. Many of the direct results of an incorrect calculation can lead to even larger problems such as failed protection mechanisms or even arbitrary code execution.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. In many cases, lower-level children or descendants are more appropriate. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.
**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Understand your programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation. Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, "not-a-number" calculations, and how your language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Use the appropriate type for the desired action. For example, in C/C++, only use unsigned types for values that could never be negative, such as height, width, or other numbers related to quantity.



### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** 

Weaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-0022:** chain: mobile phone Bluetooth implementation does not include offset when calculating packet length (CWE-682), leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist
