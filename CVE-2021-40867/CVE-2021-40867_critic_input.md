# Critic Input for CVE-2021-40867



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Certain NETGEAR smart switches are affected by an **authentication hijacking race-condition** vulnerability by an unauthenticated attacker who uses the same source IP address as an admin in the process of logging in (e.g., behind the same NAT device, or already in possession of a foothold on an admins machine). This occurs because the multi-step HTTP authentication process is effectively tied only to the source IP address. This affects GC108P before 1.0.8.2, GC108PP before 1.0.8.2, GS108Tv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPP before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TUP before 1.0.5.3, GS308T before 1.0.3.2, GS310TP before 1.0.3.2, GS710TUP before 1.0.5.3, GS716TP before 1.0.4.2, GS716TPP before 1.0.4.2, GS724TPP before 2.0.6.3, GS724TPv2 before 2.0.6.3, GS728TPPv2 before 6.0.8.2, GS728TPv2 before 6.0.8.2, GS750E before 1.0.1.10, GS752TPP before 6.0.8.2, GS752TPv2 before 6.0.8.2, MS510TXM before 1.0.4.2, and MS510TXUP before 1.0.4.2.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-40867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the web UI authentication logic of certain NETGEAR smart switches. Specifically, the `get.cgi` handler, which is responsible for providing session bootstrapping information, relies solely on the client IP and a guessable browser type number for verification. This lack of proper session management and reliance on easily spoofable data allows an attacker to hijack the authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Session Handling:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of a secure session identifier. Instead of using a cryptographically secure token, the system relies on the client's IP address and user-agent type which is insufficient for securing the session.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is exploitable due to a race condition between the legitimate admin's browser and the attacker's requests to the `/cgi/get.cgi` endpoint. The attacker can flood the endpoint to gain session information before the legitimate user.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The lack of proper input validation when polling for the session status allows an attacker to send repeated requests without having to authenticate or prove they are the intended user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Compromise:** A successful exploitation allows the attacker to hijack the session bootstrapping information. This grants the attacker full administrative access to the device's web UI and thus complete control of the switch.
*   **Data Manipulation:** With admin access, the attacker can manipulate switch configurations, potentially disrupting network operations or redirecting traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Same IP Requirement:** The primary attack vector requires the attacker to have the same IP address as the admin who is logging in. This can be achieved by:
    *   Compromising a machine on the same network as the admin with limited privileges.
    *   Sharing the same source NAT IP
    *   Spoofing the IP address, potentially requiring low-level network manipulation.
*   **Race Condition:** The attacker needs to win a race condition with a 1-second window during the admin's login process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim and ideally have the same IP address as the admin.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs technical knowledge to craft HTTP requests to flood `/cgi/get.cgi` and potentially spoof IP addresses.
*   **Timing:** Exploitation requires an attacker to be active while a legitimate administrator is logging into the web UI.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified as "Draconian Fear" by Gynvael Coldwind and reported to NETGEAR.
*   NETGEAR assigned this vulnerability the identifier PSV-2021-0144.
*   The advisory mentions a "90-day policy", indicating that the vulnerability was disclosed publicly 90 days after it was initially reported.
*   The provided proof-of-concept exploit (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can successfully exploit this vulnerability.
*   The advisory also lists multiple other vulnerabilities that were addressed by these patches (PSV-2021-0140, PSV-2021-0145), but the details for "Draconian Fear" are the most detailed.
*  The suggested fix is to use a cryptographically secure random value for the result file name, which should then be passed as a token and used for subsequent get.cgi requests

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing insights into the technical aspects of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability is an **authentication hijacking race-condition** because the HTTP authentication process is effectively tied only to the source IP address. This aligns well with CWE-291, Reliance on IP Address for Authentication, which is a Variant level CWE and ALLOWED. The CVE description mentions that the `get.cgi` handler relies solely on the client IP and a guessable browser type number for verification, confirming the use of IP address for authentication. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also relevant because the system doesn't properly authenticate users, allowing unauthenticated access. CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) is also relevant because an attacker can spoof the IP address to bypass authentication. However, CWE-291 is the most specific and appropriate because it directly addresses the **reliance on IP address** which is the root cause. The suggested fix is to use a cryptographically secure random value for the result file name, which should then be passed as a token and used for subsequent get.cgi requests, this indicates the need for proper authentication mechanisms."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-291 is a variant of CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing), and CWE-290 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The relationships suggest a hierarchy of authentication weaknesses, but CWE-291 is chosen for its specificity to the reliance on IP addresses. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) can be related as it describes the absence of proper authentication."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.



## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

### Extended Description
IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-290
ChildOf -> CWE-923
ChildOf -> CWE-471

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use other means of identity verification that cannot be simply spoofed. Possibilities include a username/password or certificate.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
