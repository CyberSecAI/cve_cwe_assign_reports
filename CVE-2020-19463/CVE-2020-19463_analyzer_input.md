# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2020-19463

## Vulnerability Description
An issue has been found in function vfprintf in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a **stack overflow**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** PDF2JSON
- **version:** 0.70
- **component:** vfprintf function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack overflow in the `vfprintf` function when processing a crafted PDF file. The fuzzer identified that a specific malformed PDF input triggers excessive recursion within the `vfprintf` function calls, which leads to exhausting the stack space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: A classic vulnerability where a program exceeds the stack's memory allocation leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The program crashes due to a segmentation fault, preventing it from processing further requests and making the application unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: A specially crafted PDF file acts as the attack vector. The malformed PDF contains elements causing excessive recursion when parsed by `pdf2json`, triggering the stack overflow in the `vfprintf` call chain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious PDF file as input to the `pdf2json` program. No special privileges are required beyond the ability to execute the vulnerable program with a crafted PDF.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Valgrind output clearly demonstrates the stack overflow and subsequent crash.
- The error messages in the Valgrind output like "Stack overflow in thread #1: can't grow stack to 0xffe801000" point directly to the nature of the vulnerability.
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) further confirms that this behavior is reproducible.
