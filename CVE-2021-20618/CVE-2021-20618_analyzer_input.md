# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-20618

## Vulnerability Description
**Privilege chaining vulnerability** in acmailer ver. 4.0.2 and earlier, and acmailer DB ver. 1.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and to gain an administrative privilege which may result in obtaining the sensitive information on the server via unspecified vectors.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Privilege chaining vulnerability**
- **impact:** bypass authentication and gain administrative privilege
- **vector:** unspecified vectors
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** acmailer and acmailer DB

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a "Privilege Chaining" issue within the survey/questionnaire functionality of acmailer and acmailer DB. Specifically, the issue is present in the `enq_*.cgi` files related to handling survey functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Chaining (CWE-268):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges by exploiting the chain of actions or requests within the affected software. It's likely an issue where one action or request allows unintended access to functions or resources, eventually leading to full administrative privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Administrative Access:** A remote attacker can obtain full administrative privileges on the affected system.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** This leads to the potential leakage of sensitive data on the server, including email lists and login credentials.
*  **CGI File Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially destroy CGI files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning that an attacker does not need local access to the system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability via network requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
*   acmailer versions 4.0.2 and earlier
*   acmailer DB versions 1.1.4 and earlier

**Mitigation:**
*   Delete the following files from the installation folder:
    *   `enq_detail.cgi`
    *   `enq_detail_mail.cgi`
    *   `enq_edit.cgi`
    *   `enq_form.cgi`
    *   `enq_list.cgi`
* Upgrade to acmailer 4.0.3 or later, or acmailer DB 1.1.5 or later.

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory from acmailer.jp confirms the existence of the vulnerability and provides mitigation steps by deleting the mentioned files, if the version is not upgraded.
* The JVN advisory provides the CWE classification, CVSS scores, and detailed impact information for CVE-2021-20618.
