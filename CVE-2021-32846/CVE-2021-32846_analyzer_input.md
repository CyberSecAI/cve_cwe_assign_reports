# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-32846

## Vulnerability Description
HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to **uninitialized memory use**. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uninitialized memory use**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **product:** HyperKit
- **version:** 0.20210107
- **component:** pci_vtsock_proc_tx function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Hyperkit, including CVE-2021-32846.

Based on the provided information:

**CVE-2021-32846**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` function in `pci_virtio_sock.c` does not properly handle a negative return value from `vq_getchain`. The `vq_getchain` function can return a negative value if it encounters an unrecoverable error. This negative value is then used in a loop by the `iovec_pull` function, which is not designed to handle a negative value, leading to a crash or memory corruption.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized memory use, improper error handling, potential memory corruption
*  **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious guest can crash the host, leading to a denial of service. Under specific circumstances, this vulnerability may also allow for memory corruption on the host.
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious guest OS can trigger the vulnerability by manipulating virtio queues such that `vq_getchain` returns a negative value in `pci_vtsock_proc_tx`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system running on a vulnerable hyperkit instance. The attacker must be able to manipulate the virtio queues exposed to the guest OS.
