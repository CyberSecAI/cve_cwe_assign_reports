  "query": "Four format string injection vulnerabilities exist in the XCMD testWifiAP functionality of Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit 6.9X and 6.9Z. Specially-crafted configuration values can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker can modify a configuration value and then execute an XCMD to trigger these vulnerabilities.This vulnerability arises from format string injection via the `wpapsk` configuration parameter, as used within the `testWifiAP` XCMD handler",
