### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data**
- **product:** Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome
- **component:** API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Passwordstate API authenticates requests from the browser extension. Instead of using a secure, randomly generated, or cryptographically signed token, the API relies on a token that is generated by concatenating user information and XOR encrypting it with a hardcoded key. Crucially, only the username is validated from this decrypted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data (CWE-302):** The core vulnerability is that the authentication token is based on user-controlled data (username), XOR-encrypted with a static key. Since only the username is actually used for validation, an attacker can generate valid tokens for any known username using the hardcoded key. This effectively bypasses authentication.
*   **Hardcoded Key:** The use of a hardcoded XOR key for encrypting the authentication token is a significant security flaw, as the key can be extracted and used by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Passwordstate API by crafting a valid token for any known user.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Through the API, an attacker can retrieve all passwords associated with the compromised user that have a URL entry, a common practice for passwords stored via browser extension.
*   **Data Modification:**  The API also allows for modification of passwords, potentially leading to complete compromise of accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack can be performed remotely, as the API is accessed over the network.
*   **API Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a special token to authenticate with the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of a Valid Username:** The attacker must know at least one valid username from the Passwordstate instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Passwordstate API endpoint.
*   **Ability to Forge Tokens:** The attacker needs to be able to XOR encrypt the username with the hardcoded key. This can be done with readily available tools, as demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Constantin MÃ¼ller, Jan Benninger, and Pascal Zenker.
*   A public proof-of-concept exploit is available.
*   The vendor, Click Studios, has released a fix in Passwordstate 9.6 - Build 9653.
*   The vulnerability is part of a chain of vulnerabilities that, when combined, could allow an attacker to gain a reverse shell and compromise the entire Passwordstate system.
*   The modzero.com article provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerabilities, the attack chain, and a timeline of the disclosure.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is **authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data**. The vulnerability description explicitly states "The manipulation leads to **authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the API relies on a token generated by concatenating user information and XOR encrypting it with a hardcoded key, where only the username is validated. An attacker can forge valid tokens for any username by exploiting this **weakness**, directly matching CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data). The Retriever Results do not include CWE-302, but the vulnerability description explicitly points to this authentication bypass. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent class, CWE-302 is more specific.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-302 is a base level CWE and does not have any direct relationships listed in the provided information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention in the vulnerability description and the clear explanation in the CVE reference summary)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* A secondary contributing factor is the use of a **hardcoded key**, as highlighted in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "the API relies on a token that is generated by concatenating user information and XOR encrypting it with a **hardcoded key**." This directly relates to CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). The hardcoded key allows attackers to generate valid authentication tokens, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism. While CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) is suggested by the Retriever Results, CWE-798 is more precise because it specifically addresses the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key, which is a more technical description of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-798 does not indicate any usage restrictions.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-798 is a class-level CWE, and children such as CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) or CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) might be even more specific. However, lacking full details on the exact type of credential, CWE-798 provides a sufficiently accurate classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.80 (High confidence due to supporting evidence from the CVE reference summary and alignment with the CWE description.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

ChildOf -> CWE-798
PeerOf -> CWE-321
PeerOf -> CWE-257
CanFollow -> CWE-656

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For outbound authentication: store passwords outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded password. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access
- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]
- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**

For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples

**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Prevention schemes mirror that of hard-coded password storage.



### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

- **CVE-2002-1730:** Authentication bypass by setting certain cookies to "true".



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.
