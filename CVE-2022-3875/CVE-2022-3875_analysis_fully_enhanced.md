# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-3875

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-302 | Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data | 0.95 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.80 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is **authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data**. The vulnerability description explicitly states "The manipulation leads to **authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the API relies on a token generated by concatenating user information and XOR encrypting it with a hardcoded key, where only the username is validated. An attacker can forge valid tokens for any username by exploiting this **weakness**, directly matching CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data). The Retriever Results do not include CWE-302, but the vulnerability description explicitly points to this authentication bypass. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent class, CWE-302 is more specific.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-302 is a base level CWE and does not have any direct relationships listed in the provided information.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention in the vulnerability description and the clear explanation in the CVE reference summary)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* A secondary contributing factor is the use of a **hardcoded key**, as highlighted in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "the API relies on a token that is generated by concatenating user information and XOR encrypting it with a **hardcoded key**." This directly relates to CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). The hardcoded key allows attackers to generate valid authentication tokens, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism. While CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) is suggested by the Retriever Results, CWE-798 is more precise because it specifically addresses the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key, which is a more technical description of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-798 does not indicate any usage restrictions.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-798 is a class-level CWE, and children such as CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) or CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) might be even more specific. However, lacking full details on the exact type of credential, CWE-798 provides a sufficiently accurate classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.80 (High confidence due to supporting evidence from the CVE reference summary and alignment with the CWE description.)

- **CVE-2021-37555** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37555](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37555): Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]
- **CVE-2021-35033** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-35033](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-35033): Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-27438**: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).
- **CVE-2021-34757**: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.
- **CVE-2020-1716**: A flaw was found in the ceph-ansible playbook where it contained hardcoded passwords that were being used as default passwords while deploying Ceph services. Any authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw to brute-force Ceph deployments, and gain administrator access to Ceph clusters via the Ceph dashboard to initiate read, write, and delete Ceph clusters and also modify Ceph cluster configurations. Versions before ceph-ansible 6.0.0alpha1 are affected.
- **CVE-2021-21818**: A hard-coded password vulnerability exists in the Zebra IP Routing Manager functionality of D-LINK DIR-3040 1.13B03. A specially crafted network request can lead to a denial of service. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2021-21820**: A hard-coded password vulnerability exists in the Libcli Test Environment functionality of D-LINK DIR-3040 1.13B03. A specially crafted network request can lead to code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.
- **CVE-2021-27440**: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).
- **CVE-2021-27452**: The software contains a hard-coded password that could allow an attacker to take control of the merging unit using these hard-coded credentials on the MU320E (all firmware versions prior to v04A00.1).
