## Vulnerability Description
Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1_2890 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. The vulnerability lies in rootfs_ In / goform / setsystimecfg of / bin / tdhttpd in ubif file system, attackers can access http//ip/goform/SetSysTimeCfg, and by setting the ntpserve parameter, the **stack buffer overflow** can be caused to achieve the effect of router denial of service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** setting ntpserve parameter
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Tenda AX1803
- **version:** v1.0.0.1_2890
- **component:** http//ip/goform/SetSysTimeCfg in ubif file system

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `fromsetsystime` function within the `/bin/tdhttpd` binary of the Tenda AX1803 router's firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `ntpserver` parameter from a POST request into a fixed-size buffer (`v32`) on the stack, without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack if the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Uncontrolled Input:** The `ntpserver` parameter is directly taken from a POST request, making it vulnerable to manipulation by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address of the `fromsetsystime` function. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. In the context of this router, the crash typically leads to a router restart, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSysTimeCfg` endpoint.
- **`ntpserver` Parameter:** The attacker must provide a malicious value to the `ntpserver` parameter in the POST request that is large enough to overflow the stack buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface. This can either be local or remote depending on the network configuration.
- **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/SetSysTimeCfg`) and the vulnerable parameter (`ntpserver`).
- **No Authentication Mentioned:** The provided information implies no authentication is needed to exploit this issue. However, the provided POC has a `Cookie: password=...`, so this may require more investigation.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located within the `fromsetsystime` function of the `/bin/tdhttpd` binary.
- The `strcpy(&V32[16], B4)` statement is the location of the buffer overflow. `V32` is a stack variable, and `B4` is a pointer to the attacker-controlled `ntpserver` parameter.
- The provided pseudo code includes another vulnerable function `fromSetIpMacBind` that contains a separate stack buffer overflow via the `list` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided POC shows that sending an `ntpServer` parameter with a value of 'a' repeated more than `0x134` times triggers the crash.
- The provided content includes a detailed analysis of the vulnerable code section in assembly/pseudo-C form.
- The affected firmware version is Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1_2890.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack buffer overflow** occurs due to the `strcpy` function copying the `ntpserver` parameter from a POST request into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms this, mentioning the `strcpy(&V32[16], B4)` statement as the location of the buffer overflow, where `V32` is a stack variable. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a condition where a buffer on the stack is overwritten. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a broader category, CWE-121 is more specific because the overflow occurs on the stack.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Complete confidence due to explicit evidence of a stack-based buffer overflow.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
