# Critic Input for CVE-2021-29529



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a **heap buffer overflow** in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating input values so that **float rounding results in off-by-one error** in accessing image elements. This is because the implementation(https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L62-L66) computes two integers (representing the upper and lower bounds for interpolation) by ceiling and flooring a floating point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upper[i]` might be smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside of the image. Then, in the interpolation code(https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L245-L264), this would result in **heap buffer overflow**. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **float rounding results in off-by-one error**
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **version:** 2.5.0
- **component:** tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29529:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a floating-point rounding error during the calculation of interpolation bounds in the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` operation. When resizing images, the code calculates lower and upper bounds for interpolation using `floor` and `ceil` operations on a floating-point value representing the input coordinate. Due to floating-point imprecision, the calculated upper bound can become less than the lower bound. This, combined with clamping the upper bound to `in_size - 1`, could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The core vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `OutputLerpForChannels` function.
- Off-by-one error: This arises because incorrect interpolation bounds are calculated due to rounding issues, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- Incorrect boundary checks: The clamping of the upper bound to `in_size - 1` combined with the rounding issue, created the conditions for out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow, which can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided description and sample code demonstrate how specific input parameters can trigger this overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting specific input values (image data, size, min, max, and alignment parameters) to `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear`, an attacker can manipulate the internal floating-point values to induce the rounding error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` function and control the relevant input parameters, such as the images, the target size, the quantization range, and the alignment settings.

**More Details:**

The provided content includes a code snippet that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

l = [256, 328, 361, 17, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 384]
images = tf.constant(l, shape=[1, 1, 15, 1], dtype=tf.qint32)
size = tf.constant([12, 6], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)
min = tf.constant(80.22522735595703)
max = tf.constant(80.39215850830078)

tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear(images=images, size=size, min=min, max=max,
                                   align_corners=True, half_pixel_centers=True)
```
This code highlights how specific combinations of input values can trigger the vulnerability, especially when `align_corners` and `half_pixel_centers` are set to True, which is necessary for the bug to be exploitable.

The fix introduces a check that enforces that the lower bound (`interpolation->lower[i]`) is less or equal to the upper bound `interpolation->upper[i]`:
```c++
interpolation->lower[i] = std::max(static_cast<int64>(in_f), static_cast<int64>(0));
interpolation->upper[i] = std::min(static_cast<int64>(std::ceil(in)), in_size - 1);
interpolation->lower[i] = std::min(interpolation->lower[i], interpolation->upper[i]);
```
This ensures the lower bound is capped by the upper bound, preventing the out-of-bounds access.

The affected versions are < 2.5.0. Patched versions include 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" occurs due to a "**float rounding results in off-by-one error**". This directly corresponds to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a buffer overflow where the buffer is allocated on the heap. The provided code snippet and the CVE reference summary confirm this. CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) is also relevant as it describes the specific error leading to the overflow. The floating-point rounding leading to `interpolation->upper[i]` potentially being smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]` causing out-of-bounds access is a clear instance of an off-by-one error. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the usage of both CWE-122 and CWE-193.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), making it a more specific choice given the heap allocation detail. CWE-193 can precede CWE-119, indicating it's a contributing factor to the buffer overflow. The integer overflow related CWEs aren't directly related as the problem is with floating points, not integers.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 




### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist



## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
off-by-five: An "off-by-five" error was reported for sudo in 2002 (CVE-2002-0184), but that is more like a "length calculation" error.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-617
CanPrecede -> CWE-170
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** When copying character arrays or using character manipulation methods, the correct size parameter must be used to account for the null terminator that needs to be added at the end of the array. Some examples of functions susceptible to this weakness in C include strcpy(), strncpy(), strcat(), strncat(), printf(), sprintf(), scanf() and sscanf().



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.
