# Summary 
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.95 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**heap buffer overflow**" occurs due to a "**float rounding results in off-by-one error**". This directly corresponds to CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), which is a buffer overflow where the buffer is allocated on the heap. The provided code snippet and the CVE reference summary confirm this. CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) is also relevant as it describes the specific error leading to the overflow. The floating-point rounding leading to `interpolation->upper[i]` potentially being smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]` causing out-of-bounds access is a clear instance of an off-by-one error. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the usage of both CWE-122 and CWE-193.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), making it a more specific choice given the heap allocation detail. CWE-193 can precede CWE-119, indicating it's a contributing factor to the buffer overflow. The integer overflow related CWEs aren't directly related as the problem is with floating points, not integers.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
