# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-35928

## Query
AES Crypt is a file encryption software for multiple platforms. AES Crypt for Linux built using the source on GitHub and having the version number 3.11 has a vulnerability with respect to reading user-provided passwords and confirmations via command-line prompts. Passwords lengths were not checked before being read. This vulnerability may lead to buffer overruns. This does _not_ affect source code found on aescrypt.com, nor is the vulnerability present when providing a password or a key via the `-p` or `-k` command-line options. The problem was fixed via in commit 68761851b and will be included in release 3.16. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should us the `-p` or `-k` options to provide a password or key.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: Passwords lengths were not checked before being read
- **weakness**: buffer overruns
