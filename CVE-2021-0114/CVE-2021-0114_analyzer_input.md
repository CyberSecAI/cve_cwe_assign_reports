## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0114:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is an "Unchecked return value" in the firmware of some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The firmware does not properly check the return value of a function or operation. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to an escalation of privileges.
- There is also the possibility of information disclosure.
- In addition, a successful exploit could result in unauthorized modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.
-  The attacker also needs to be in a privileged position, though the specific level of privilege is not described in the Intel document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user with local access to the target system.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the firmware not checking the return value of a certain operation. This lack of validation could allow a privileged user with local access to the system to perform actions that lead to privilege escalation.

**Additional Details**

- The provided documents indicate that the issue affects multiple Intel processor families.
- Intel released firmware updates to mitigate the issue.
- NetApp systems that utilize the affected processors are also vulnerable.
- NetApp's advisory (NTAP-20220210-0007) lists the affected NetApp products and provides links to obtain updated BIOS versions.
- The CVSS v3.1 score for this CVE is 7.9 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N.
