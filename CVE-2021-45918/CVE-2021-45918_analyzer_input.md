# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-45918

## Vulnerability Description
NHIs health insurance web service component has **insufficient validation for input string length**, which can result in **heap-based buffer overflow** attack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to flood the memory space reserved for the program, in order to terminate service without authentication, which requires a system restart to recover service.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient validation for input string length**
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** terminate service without authentication
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** NHIs health insurance web service component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45918.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input string length validation in a specific function of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Card Network Service Component. This results in a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Insufficient input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS). The service needs to be restarted to restore functionality.
