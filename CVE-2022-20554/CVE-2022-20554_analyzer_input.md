# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-20554

## Vulnerability Description
In removeEventHubDevice of InputDevice.cpp, there is a possible OOB read due to a **use after free**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-13Android ID A-245770596

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use after free**
- **impact:** local escalation of privilege
- **vector:** OOB read
- **product:** Android
- **version:** 13
- **component:** removeEventHubDevice of InputDevice.cpp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-20554

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly delete the `mController` object when an event hub device is removed. The `mController` object stores a reference to a context that gets deleted when the device goes away.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. After an event hub device is removed, the `mController` object, which still exists, holds a dangling pointer to the deallocated context. Accessing this dangling pointer leads to an illegal memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability is classified as an EoP. Accessing freed memory can lead to crashes or, in some circumstances, allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges by potentially manipulating program flow or memory.
- **Crash:** The immediate impact, as indicated by the commit message, is an illegal memory access, which will lead to a crash of the affected process, in this case, inputflinger.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering the removal of an event hub device while there is still a dangling reference through the `mController` object. The exact method for triggering this removal is not specified in the provided information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the removal of the event hub device. This may require some level of access to the system or the ability to manipulate system events or devices. The level of access needed is not specified in the provided information.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves deleting the `mController` when the event hub device is going away.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Android Framework and is fixed in Android 13.
*   The commit message indicates a test case (`inputflinger_tests:InputDeviceTest#DumpDoesNotCrash`) was added to ensure the issue does not reoccur.
*   The commit was cherry-picked from commit `30feb8c162aa2e5348bba20e99e8db2a61bac6e7`
