# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-317 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **"cleartext storage of sensitive information in GUI."** This directly aligns with CWE-317 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI), which is a Variant-level CWE and thus more specific than its parent. The "**root cause**" is also listed as "**cleartext storage of sensitive information**" and the vulnerability description states that the **"component"** is the **"GUI"**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this, stating that "user passwords (LDAP), RADIUS shared secret, and the Elastic Cloud database password are not properly encrypted" and are stored in **cleartext** within the GUI. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-317 as the top match. Therefore, CWE-317 is the most appropriate primary CWE.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-317 is a variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). While CWE-312 is applicable, CWE-317 provides a more specific classification due to the vulnerability's location within the GUI. No direct relationships were identified that would alter the primary classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to strong evidence from the vulnerability description, CVE reference materials, and retriever results.)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a valid secondary CWE because it represents the broader class of the vulnerability. While CWE-317 is more specific, CWE-312 captures the fundamental weakness of storing sensitive data in cleartext. As CWE-317 is a variant of CWE-312, the parent is a good secondary candidate to capture the general vulnerability class.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-312 is a parent of CWE-317. Including CWE-312 provides a broader context for the vulnerability, but is less descriptive than CWE-317.
- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate confidence as it is a broader classification, but relevant as a parent of the primary CWE.)
