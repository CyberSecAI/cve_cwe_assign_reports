## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this issue report is related to CVE-2021-46478.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `jsiClearStack` function within the `src/jsiEval.c` file of the jsish project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, which occurs when the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap. The specific location is in the `jsiClearStack` function at line 120. The vulnerability also impacts functions `jsiPop` and `jsiEvalCodeSub` as the crash log indicates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash due to memory corruption. In this specific case the program crashes with an AddressSanitizer error. Depending on the specific circumstances the overflow could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious JavaScript code snippet. In this instance, the provided PoC (Proof of Concept) code shows the overflow triggered through a combination of a `Math.sin` call, an if statement, a switch statement, and an assertion. The execution of this crafted JavaScript code leads to the memory corruption.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code using the vulnerable jsish interpreter. This would likely require either direct access to a system running the vulnerable software or the ability to inject malicious code through a trusted or web-based application that utilizes the interpreter.
