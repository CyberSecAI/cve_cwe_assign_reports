# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities [**CWE-121**]" which aligns perfectly with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The evidence shows that specifically crafted HTTP requests can trigger this condition, leading to arbitrary code execution. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" sections further reinforce this mapping, explicitly mentioning CWE-121 as the relevant weakness. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates that its usage is ALLOWED, confirming the appropriateness of this mapping.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a broader category, the description specifically mentions a stack-based buffer overflow, making CWE-121 the more specific and accurate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The vulnerability description explicitly mentions CWE-121)
