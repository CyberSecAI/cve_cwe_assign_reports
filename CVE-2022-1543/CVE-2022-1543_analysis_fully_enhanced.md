# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-130 | Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data. |
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is identified as the **Improper handling of Length parameter**. The vulnerability description clearly states that when the text size is large enough, the service results in a momentary outage in a production environment, potentially leading to memory corruption. This aligns directly with CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency). The provided fix in the CVE reference links involves adding `StringUtils.abbreviate` to limit the length of the profile name. This confirms that the root cause is related to handling the length parameter. CWE-130 is a Base level CWE, which is appropriate for this type of vulnerability.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* No direct relationships found in the provided information. However, given the nature of the vulnerability, CWE-130 could potentially lead to a denial of service or memory corruption, which could have further implications.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to clear vulnerability description and supporting evidence from CVE reference links)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a secondary candidate. The vulnerability description mentions that large text sizes can lead to memory corruption. CWE-789 describes a scenario where the product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value without ensuring that the size is within expected limits. While the description focuses on length parameter handling, excessive length could lead to excessive memory allocation, making CWE-789 potentially relevant. CWE-789 is a Variant level CWE, which is more specific than Class level CWEs.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-789 is a child of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). This relationship suggests that the root cause may involve a lack of limits on resource allocation.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.7 (Moderate confidence because excessive length can trigger excessive memory allocation)

---
- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is another secondary candidate. The vulnerability description states that the product does not handle the length parameter properly. CWE-1284 states that the product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties. This aligns with the vulnerability, as the product doesn't properly validate the length of the input.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.6 (Moderate confidence due to the product not validating the length of the input)



## Known Examples for CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1440](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1440): lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2374](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-2374): lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-31401**: An issue was discovered in tcp_rcv() in nptcp.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.
- **CVE-2021-31802**: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\n before the Content-Length header.
- **CVE-2021-37663**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-37665**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-3655**: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory.
- **CVE-2021-21404**: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.
- **CVE-2021-1903**: Possible denial of service scenario can occur due to lack of length check on Channel Switch Announcement IE in beacon or probe response frame in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking
