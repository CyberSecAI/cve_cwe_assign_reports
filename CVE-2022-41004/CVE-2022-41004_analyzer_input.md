# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41004

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no ip nat outside source (udp|tcp|all) (WORD|null) WORD to A.B.C.D (WORD|null) description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses command templates with `sprintf` to format strings based on user-supplied parameters. The size of user-controlled parameters is not checked against the destination buffer, leading to stack-based buffer overflows when the input is larger than the allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the `DetranCLI` command parsing of the Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020 router.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can send specially-crafted network packets to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a sequence of requests to the vulnerable `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the router and have the ability to craft commands with arguments that are long enough to cause a buffer overflow. The vulnerability is reachable through the CLI interface, which suggests an authenticated user."
