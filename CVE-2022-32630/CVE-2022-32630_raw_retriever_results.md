# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-32630

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-32630

## Query
In throttling, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect calculation of buffer size. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID ALPS07405966 Issue ID ALPS07405966.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: incorrect calculation of buffer size
- **weakness**: out of bounds write
