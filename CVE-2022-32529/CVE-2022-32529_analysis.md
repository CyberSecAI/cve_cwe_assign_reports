|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** vulnerability exists that could cause a stack-based buffer overflow." While the description mentions CWE-120, the fact that it results in a "stack-based buffer overflow" allows us to choose the more specific **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow**. CWE-121 is a variant of a more general buffer overflow, so it's appropriate to use it. CWE-120 is also included because it's a contributing factor to the **rootcause**.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**. CWE-121 is also a child of **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input**, because the copy operation without checking size can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High evidence from the vulnerability description. The description clearly indicates a stack-based buffer overflow due to a buffer copy without size checking.)
