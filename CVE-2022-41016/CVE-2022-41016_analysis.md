## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states that there are several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities. The **root cause** is a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality.". However, CWE-121 is more specific than CWE-120 as it specifies the overflow is stack-based, which aligns with the description. CWE-121 is a Variant, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-121 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of a buffer overflow. It is related to CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) but is more specific.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
