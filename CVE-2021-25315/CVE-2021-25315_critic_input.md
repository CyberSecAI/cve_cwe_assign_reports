## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states an **Improper Authentication** vulnerability. The CVE reference links content summary confirms this, stating that the root cause involves an overlapping of patches leading to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the salt-api. This aligns with CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which describes a situation where the product does not sufficiently prove that a claimed identity is correct. While CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the provided information lacks the specificity to pinpoint a more precise Base or Variant level CWE related to authentication bypasses or specific authentication algorithm weaknesses. The description does not give information on the specific implementation flaw only that authentication is not properly handled. For example, more information would be needed to select CWE-303."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-287 is a Class-level weakness, and many child CWEs exist that provide more specific details. For example, CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass) and CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name). Without more specific information it's difficult to select a more specific CWE. CWE-287 CanPrecede many other weaknesses, highlighting the potential for a chain of vulnerabilities following an authentication bypass."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High confidence due to direct mention of "Improper Authentication" and confirmation in CVE details.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm) is a possible secondary weakness. The CVE summary indicates a patch overlap led to the **unauthenticated** issue. It's possible the original patch intended to implement a specific authentication algorithm, but the overlap resulted in an incorrect implementation. However, this is speculative as it is not explicitly stated. Without more details on the implementation, it is impossible to say if an authentication algorithm was used and implemented incorrectly."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-303 is a Base level weakness. There aren't any direct relationships provided for this CWE. However, it would potentially be a child of CWE-287, but that relationship information is not available."

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.65 (Medium confidence, based on the possibility of an authentication algorithm being implemented incorrectly, but lacking explicit evidence)

- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

### Extended Description
This incorrect implementation may allow authentication to be bypassed.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ParentOf -> CWE-304

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0750:** Conditional should have been an 'or' not an 'and'.



## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** Use an authentication framework or library such as the OWASP ESAPI Authentication feature.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
