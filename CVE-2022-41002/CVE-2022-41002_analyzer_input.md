# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-41002

## Vulnerability Description
Several **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities exist in the DetranCLI command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow is in the function that manages the no icmp check link WORD destination WORD interval retries description (WORD|null) command template.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
This document provides detailed information about CVE-2022-41002 and related vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality of Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to format strings based on user-supplied input without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing.
- Unchecked size of command parameters when using `sprintf` to format strings leading to buffer overflows.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution on the device. This could enable an attacker to gain complete control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through specially crafted network packets sent to the device, which trigger the vulnerable `DetranCLI` commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.  The CVSS score indicates a high privilege is required, suggesting that an attacker may need to be authenticated to use the vulnerable commands.

**Specific details for CVE-2022-41002:**

- Vulnerable command template: `no icmp check link WORD destination WORD interval <1-255> retries <1-255> description (WORD|null)`
- Vulnerable code: `sprintf(buff_0x80,"%d<%s<%s<%d<%d<%s",1,*argv,argv[1],atoi_argv[2],atoi_argv[3],argv[4]);`
- The vulnerability occurs because the size of the `WORD` parameters and the description are not checked before being copied into the `buff_0x80` buffer using `sprintf`.
