# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-28471

## Vulnerability Description
In ffjpeg (commit hash caade60), the function bmp_load() in bmp.c contains an **integer overflow** vulnerability, which eventually results in the heap overflow in jfif_encode() in jfif.c. This is due to the incomplete patch for issue 38

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** heap overflow
- **product:** ffjpeg
- **version:** caade60
- **component:** bmp_load() in bmp.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

-   An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `bmp_load` function when processing BMP image files. Specifically, the multiplication of `pb->width * 3` in `pb->stride = ALIGN(pb->width * 3, 4)` can overflow, resulting in a small value for `pb->stride`. This small `pb->stride` bypasses the size check performed later, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability occurs because the code calculates the stride (bytes per row) of the BMP image using the width and a multiplication by 3 without adequate checks for integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Integer overflow in `bmp.c:43`. The `pb->stride` calculation overflows and results in an insufficient stride value.
- Heap buffer overflow in `jfif.c:763`.  Due to the incorrect stride calculation, the memory allocated for image data is too small which leads to a heap buffer overflow in the `jfif_encode` function when accessing the image data.
- Incorrect size check in `bmp.c:44` that relies on the result of the previous integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   A heap buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches. Specifically in this case it causes a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted BMP image file containing a large width value which causes the integer overflow.
-  The `ffjpeg` program is then used to encode the crafted BMP to a JPEG, which will trigger the heap buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted BMP file as input to the `ffjpeg` program.
-   The attacker does not need a specific position on the target system, the vulnerability can be triggered by any user who can execute the `ffjpeg` application.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was initially reported as a duplicate of issue #38 but was deemed to have an incomplete fix.
- The initial PoC could not be easily reproduced, because of special characters when copy-pasting from the browser
- The vulnerability was found to be reproducible on a 32-bit program because `unsigned long` is 4 bytes instead of 8 in 64-bit, causing a successful allocation due to overflow.
- The fix in issue #38 addressed a different part of the code.

In summary, the vulnerability is a classic integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow, which can be triggered via a malicious BMP file.
