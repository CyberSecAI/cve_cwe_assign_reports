## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states "**stack overflow** in the function formAddVpnUsers." This directly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). The vulnerability is triggered via the `vpnUsers` parameter, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). CWE-121 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance allows CWE-121 for stack-based buffer overflows.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 does not have direct relationships listed in the provided information. However, it is understood to be a type of buffer overflow, which could be related to broader buffer management issues.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (Direct match with the vulnerability description, strong evidence)
