# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The primary **weakness** is the **hardcoded credential**. The vulnerability description explicitly states: "In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to use the **hardcoded credential** in clients (username sapphire, password ims) and gain access to the portal." This aligns directly with CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), which is a Base-level CWE suitable for mapping. The Retriever Results also list CWE-798 as the top candidate with a high score. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms "**Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded credentials, "username: sapphire, password: ims" to access the portal (referenced as a related vulnerability)". MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-798 indicates this is ALLOWED.
  - The second **weakness** is the command injection vulnerability. Once authenticated (or even without authentication if the JSESSIONID is removed), an attacker can inject malicious OS commands. This aligns with CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states: "**Command injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing OS commands for "ping", "traceroute", and "snmp" functions allowing for arbitrary command execution." MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-78 indicates this is ALLOWED for OS command injection vulnerabilities.
  - The third **weakness** is the Missing Authentication for Critical Function. The vulnerability description mentions that the attack can be done even if the JSESSIONID is removed. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states "**Unauthenticated access:** The application can be accessed without requiring any authentication, or with a missing/invalid JSESSIONID, which bypasses access controls." This aligns to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is a parent of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key). Since the vulnerability explicitly mentions username and password, CWE-259 could be considered. However, CWE-798 is a more general case that encapsulates both passwords and cryptographic keys and is a better fit. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Command Injection) and is related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements). The graph relationships show CWE-78 CanPrecede CWE-269 (Privilege Management) since command injection often leads to privilege escalation.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.90 (High confidence due to explicit mention of hardcoded credentials and command injection in the vulnerability description and CVE summary)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2020-15180**: A flaw was found in the mysql-wsrep component of mariadb. Lack of input sanitization in `wsrep_sst_method` allows for command injection that can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on galera cluster nodes. This threatens the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This flaw affects mariadb versions before 10.1.47, before 10.2.34, before 10.3.25, before 10.4.15 and before 10.5.6.
