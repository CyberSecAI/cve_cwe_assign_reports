# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-31933

## Vulnerability Description
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Chamilo through 1.11.14 due to **improper input sanitization** of a parameter used for file uploads, and improper file-extension filtering for certain filenames (e.g., .phar or .pht). A remote authenticated administrator is able to upload a file containing arbitrary PHP code into specific directories via main/inc/lib/fileUpload.lib.php directory traversal to achieve PHP code execution.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **vector:** directory traversal
- **attacker:** remote authenticated administrator
- **product:** Chamilo
- **version:** through 1.11.14
- **component:** main/inc/lib/fileUpload.lib.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability addressed in the commits, which seems to correspond to CVE-2021-31933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The primary issue was the ability to execute PHP code within the `web/` directory, posing a significant security risk. This was due to insufficient restrictions on where PHP files could be executed, allowing for potential arbitrary code execution.
- Additionally, an unused upload form (`/main/upload/upload.document.php`) was present which could be a vulnerability if accessed.
- Uploaded files were not sufficiently validated which could lead to malicious code execution or path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most critical weakness was the lack of restrictions on PHP execution within the `web/` directory. An attacker could potentially upload a malicious PHP file and execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Insecure File Upload:** The file upload functionality lacked proper validation of the destination path, which could lead to path traversal attacks, allowing attackers to write files outside the intended directory.
- **Unused functionality:** Presence of unused upload form at `/main/upload/upload.document.php` could be a potential vulnerability.
- **Missing checks:** Lack of API access control and user validations could be abused by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full System Compromise:** By exploiting the arbitrary code execution vulnerability, an attacker could gain complete control of the web server, leading to data breaches, defacement, and other malicious activities.
- **Data Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to modify or delete sensitive data stored within the application.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially cause a denial of service by overloading the server with malicious requests or by corrupting system files.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted PHP file to a vulnerable directory (e.g. under web/) and gain arbitrary code execution.
- **Path Traversal:** By manipulating the upload path, attackers could potentially save malicious files to arbitrary locations outside the course directory.
- **Direct access to unused script:** By directly accessing `/main/upload/upload.document.php` an attacker could potentially use the file upload form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Chamilo instance.
- **Upload Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files using the application's upload functionality.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Areas:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable directories or files where PHP execution is possible.

**Mitigation/Fixes (from commit `f65d065`):**

- **.htaccess Update:** The `.htaccess` file was updated to disallow PHP execution within the `web/` directory. Previously, it only blocked PHP in `web/css`.
- **Unused upload form disabled:** The unused upload form `/main/upload/upload.document.php` was disabled by adding an `exit;` at the beginning of the script.
- **`phar` extension added:** The `php2phps()` function was updated to include the `phar` extension.
- **Path Validation:** Added `Security::check_abs_path` to ensure that the destination path for file uploads is within the allowed course directory.
- **API Protection:** Introduced the `api_protect_course_script()` function to add API access controls.
- **User Validation:** Added course/user validations to prevent unauthorized access.

**Additional Details:**

- The commit `2293021` included a modification of the `.htaccess` file, disallowing PHP execution inside the web/ folder, but this was only part of the fix.
- The commit `f65d065` included multiple fixes as described above which addressed multiple attack vectors.
- The provided documentation also mentions a "Secure Development Policy" which may have been violated.

In summary, the vulnerability stemmed from insufficient restrictions on PHP file execution and insecure file uploads within the Chamilo LMS. The fix involved updating `.htaccess` rules, disabling an unused upload script, adding path validation checks, and implementing API protection.
