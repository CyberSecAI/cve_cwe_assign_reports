The provided content relates to CVE-2022-1485.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Use-after-free in the File System API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Use-after-free vulnerability, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is not explicitly specified in this content, but use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can enable an attacker to control the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is present in the File System API within the Chrome browser, suggesting an attacker could trigger the use-after-free through a malicious website or crafted HTML content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would likely need to be able to get a user to visit a malicious website or load a crafted HTML document. The attacker would also need an understanding of how to trigger this specific bug within the file system API.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Use after free** in File System API...allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also confirms that the root cause of the vulnerability is a "Use-after-free in the File System API." This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes the condition where a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The CWE-416 is a Variant level of abstraction and the mapping guidance indicates that it is ALLOWED. The description of the vulnerability and the CWE-416 description are very similar, providing high confidence in this mapping. While **heap corruption** is mentioned in the description, it is a consequence of the **use-after-free** vulnerability, making CWE-416 the more accurate root cause.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). Exploiting a use-after-free can lead to other weaknesses.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of "Use after free" in the vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the reference links.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).

## CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses, accesses, or otherwise operates on a resource after that resource has been expired, released, or revoked.

**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-3547:** Chain: race condition (CWE-362) might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference (CWE-476)
