## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**memory corruption** vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted file". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is an "**Out-of-bounds Write**" in Adobe After Effects. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses this weakness, where a product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. The description of the vulnerability aligns perfectly with the characteristics of CWE-787. The impact, which is arbitrary code execution, further supports this classification. MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-787 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base level CWE and has relationships to other CWEs related to buffer overflows and memory corruption.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
