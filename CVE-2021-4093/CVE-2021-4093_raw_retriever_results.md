# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2021-4093

## Query
A flaw was found in the KVMs AMD code for supporting the Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES). A KVM guest using SEV-ES can trigger out-of-bounds reads and writes in the host kernel via a malicious VMGEXIT for a string I/O instruction (for example, outs or ins) using the exit reason SVM_EXIT_IOIO. This issue results in a crash of the entire system or a potential guest-to-host escape scenario.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: A flaw was found in the KVMs AMD code for supporting the Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES)
