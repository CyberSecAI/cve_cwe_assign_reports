| CWE-130 | Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.90
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states a **stack-based buffer overflow** due to **insufficient parameter length validation for OS information** when reading an IC card. This directly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of buffer overflow occurring specifically on the stack. The CVE reference further confirms this by stating that the HiCOS client does not perform parameter length validation leading to this overflow. CWE-121 is ALLOWED as per MITRE mapping guidance, and given the specific nature of the overflow (stack-based), it's more precise than a general buffer overflow (CWE-119)." Further, the **insufficient parameter length validation** that lead to the stack-based buffer overflow can be mapped to CWE-130. This is because the software is not properly handling the length of the OS information parameter, which caused it to write past the end of the buffer located on the stack.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The retriever results indicate that CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) is also a strong candidate. CWE-121 is directly caused by CWE-130, because the incorrect handling of the input parameter length led to writing outside the buffer. The vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary provide evidence for both the stack-based buffer overflow and the insufficient parameter length validation."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Explanation:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of stack-based buffer overflow and supporting evidence in the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials.)
