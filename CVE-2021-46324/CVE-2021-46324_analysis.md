# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack buffer overflow**" in `jsvNewFromString`. The CVE reference content summary confirms this, stating "A **stack buffer overflow** occurs when converting an array to a function parameter due to an unterminated string" and that the `jsvNewFromString` function is where the overflow occurs. This directly maps to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because a buffer on the stack is being written to beyond its intended boundaries. While CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a more specific variant, CWE-787 is still appropriate and commonly used for buffer overflows. The primary weakness is writing beyond the buffer.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a parent of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow). Given the high-level description, mapping directly to the parent CWE-787 is appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 1.0 (High evidence from vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)
