# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-46829

## Vulnerability Description
GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka GDK-PixBuf) before 2.42.8 allows a **heap-based buffer overflow** when compositing or clearing frames in GIF files, as demonstrated by io-gif-animation.c composite_frame. This overflow is controllable and could be abused for code execution, especially on 32-bit systems.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** code execution
- **vector:** compositing or clearing frames in GIF files
- **product:** GNOME GdkPixbuf
- **version:** before 2.42.8

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `composite_frame()` function within `io-gif-animation.c` of the `gdk-pixbuf` library. This function is responsible for compositing or clearing frames in GIF files.
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the `offset` variable used to access pixel data in the image buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Signed Integer Overflow:** The `offset` variable is a signed integer (`int`). When the calculated offset exceeds `INT32_MAX`, it wraps around to a negative value. This results in out-of-bounds memory access.
2.  **Large Offset Calculation:** Even if the `offset` were an unsigned integer, the calculation (`y * rowstride + x * 4`) can easily produce very large values that exceed the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The incorrect offset allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
-   **Arbitrary Memory Write:** An attacker can potentially overwrite arbitrary memory locations with controlled data by manipulating the GIF image, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
-   **Denial of Service:** The overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to denial of service (DoS). This is shown by the crashes observed when opening malicious GIFs in GNOME applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Maliciously Crafted GIF Images:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted GIF images.
-   **Application Processing GIFs:** Applications using the vulnerable `gdk-pixbuf` library are susceptible when loading/processing GIFs. This includes GNOME file system browsers and image viewers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to create a malicious GIF image that will trigger the vulnerable code path and cause the buffer overflow.
-   The attacker needs to entice a user into processing the malicious GIF with a vulnerable application that uses gdk-pixbuf. This can be done by browsing a directory with the crafted file using a file explorer, or opening it with an image viewer.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is more likely to be exploitable on 32-bit systems due to the smaller address space and how overflows manifest with signed ints. However, exploitation on 64-bit systems is not impossible.
- The `offset` variable is calculated using `x`, `y` coordinates from the GIF image, which, along with other factors, influences the buffer size. This provides a way to somewhat control the memory being accessed.
- The report included proof-of-concept (PoC) files (`wrap_around.poc` and `more_trouble.poc`) that trigger the vulnerability.
- A naive fix was proposed by the reporter: an assertion check to ensure the calculated offset is within buffer bounds (`offset + 3 <= len && offset > 0`).
- The vulnerability was fixed by commit `5398f04d772f7f8baf5265715696ed88db0f0512` which was included in gdk-pixbuf version 2.42.8 and later.
