# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-2947 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.85 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description states that Altair HyperView Player performs operations on a memory buffer and "can read from or write to a memory location outside of the intended boundary of the buffer," leading to **memory corruption**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is an "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)". However, the description also specifies that this manifests as a read access violation initially, and the **memory corruption** implies a write operation. Therefore, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is selected as the primary CWE since writing outside the buffer leads to **memory corruption**. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is included as a secondary candidate because it begins as a read access violation. Both CWEs are at the Base abstraction level, which is preferred. The MITRE mapping guidance allows both CWEs for this kind of vulnerability. CWE-119 is too general and discouraged.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-787 is more specific. Similarly, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a child of CWE-119. This relationship justifies using the more specific Base level CWEs.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.85 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)
