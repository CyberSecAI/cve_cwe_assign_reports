# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description explicitly states a **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** vulnerability exists leading to a **stack-based buffer overflow**, which is the root cause of the remote code execution. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating the vulnerability stems from a **stack-based buffer overflow** due to the **lack of proper validation** of the length of user-supplied data. CWE-121 is a Variant of CWE-119 and describes specifically a stack-based buffer overflow. Since the evidence clearly points to a stack-based overflow caused by the buffer copy, CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate primary mapping. The use of CWE-121 is ALLOWED according to MITRE."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also related to CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) as the copy operation without checking size is the cause of the overflow. CWE-120 can lead to CWE-121."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (High confidence due to the explicit description of the vulnerability and supporting CVE reference material)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that there is a **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input** vulnerability, which is the root cause that leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow**. The CVE reference link further confirms the absence of input validation before copying data into a buffer. While CWE-121 is a more precise descriptor of the overflow's location (stack), CWE-120 represents the fundamental coding error of copying a buffer without size checks, which triggers the overflow. MITRE's mapping guidance allows CWE-120 with review, suggesting it is appropriate when the description focuses on the buffer copy operation without size checking. Even though CWE-121 is selected as the primary, CWE-120 accurately describes the coding error that causes the vulnerability. CWE-120 is considered a secondary weakness."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) is a base weakness that can lead to various types of buffer overflows, including stack-based overflows (CWE-121). CWE-120 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence because the description explicitly mentions "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input" as the root cause, supported by the CVE reference details. )

- **CVE-2021-33909**: fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05.
- **CVE-2021-3420**: A flaw was found in newlib in versions prior to 4.0.0. Improper overflow validation in the memory allocation functions mEMALIGn, pvALLOc, nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc could case an integer overflow, leading to an allocation of a small buffer and then to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2021-22659**: Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Version 21.6 and below may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted Modbus packet allowing the attacker to retrieve or modify random values in the register. If successfully exploited, this may lead to a buffer overflow resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The FAULT LED will flash RED and communications may be lost. Recovery from denial-of-service condition requires the fault to be cleared by the user.
