# Critic Input for CVE-2021-45492



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
In Sage 300 ERP (formerly accpac) through 6.8.x, the installer configures the C\Sage\Sage300\Runtime directory to be the first entry in the system-wide PATH environment variable. However, this directory is writable by unprivileged users because the Sage installer **fails to set explicit permissions** and therefore inherits weak permissions from the C\ folder. Because entries in the system-wide PATH variable are included in the search order for DLLs, an attacker could perform **DLL search-order hijacking** to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM. Furthermore, if the Global Search or Web Screens functionality is enabled, then privilege escalation is possible via the GlobalSearchService and Sage.CNA.WindowsService services, again via **DLL search-order hijacking** because unprivileged users would have modify permissions on the application directory. Note that while older versions of the software default to installing in %PROGRAMFILES(X86)% (which would allow the Sage folder to inherit strong permissions, making the installation not vulnerable), the official Sage 300 installation guides for those versions recommend installing in C\Sage, which would make the installation vulnerable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper permissions and fails to set explicit permissions**
- **weakness:** **DLL search-order hijacking**
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **attacker:** unprivileged users
- **product:** Sage 300 ERP
- **version:** through 6.8.x

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2021-45492:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is insecure default file system permissions set by the Sage 300 installer. Specifically, the installer places the program files in a directory ("C:\Sage\Sage300") that inherits permissions from the root of the C: drive, allowing modification by any authenticated user. This is contrary to the more secure default locations like "C:\Program Files" where only administrators have modify access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Weak Folder Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the overly permissive permissions on the Sage 300 installation folder and its subfolders, granting "modify" access to "Authenticated Users."
2.  **PATH Environment Variable Manipulation:** The installer prepends the Sage 300 runtime directory to the system's PATH environment variable. This, combined with the weak folder permissions, creates an opportunity for DLL hijacking attacks.
3.  **Insecure Service Configurations:** Some services installed by Sage 300 run as "Local System," with executables located within the weakly-permissioned installation directory, allowing for service binary replacement.
4.  **Insecure Web Application Deployment:** Web applications associated with the Web Screens feature run as "Local System" and reside in a folder with weak permissions, allowing the injection of malicious code (e.g., webshells).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

1.  **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to "Local System" or an administrative account through various techniques.
    *   **Cross-User Attacks:** A low-privileged user can modify or replace program executables or DLLs to execute malicious code in the context of a higher privileged user when that user launches the application.
    *  **Service Binary Replacement:** A low-privileged user can replace legitimate service binaries with malicious ones, causing them to execute arbitrary code under the "Local System" account when the service starts.
    *   **Webshell Injection:** A low-privileged user can inject a webshell into the web application directories, allowing arbitrary code execution with "Local System" privileges via HTTP requests.
2.  **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the system, allowing them to perform any action possible with administrative privileges, including data exfiltration, malware deployment, and lateral movement.
3.  **DLL Hijacking:** Attackers can leverage the weakly-permissioned folder in the PATH to perform DLL hijacking attacks against other applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local Access:** Attackers need local access to the system where Sage 300 is installed. This could be achieved via compromised user credentials, malware, or a foothold gained through a different vulnerability.
2.  **File System Manipulation:** Attackers must be able to write to the Sage 300 installation folder and its subdirectories.
3.  **Service Exploitation:** Attackers can replace service binaries in the installation folder and restart or wait for the system or service to restart for the modified binaries to be executed.
4. **Web Application Exploitation**: Attackers can upload malicious scripts (webshells) to the web directories and access these scripts through HTTP requests.
5. **DLL Hijacking:** Attackers can place malicious DLLs in the Sage 300 Runtime folder, taking advantage of the fact that it is in the system PATH, and any application loading DLLs is vulnerable to code execution through a malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker needs a standard (non-administrative) user account on the target system.
2.  **File System Write Access:** The attacker requires the ability to write and modify files in the Sage 300 installation directory (typically "C:\Sage\Sage300" by default).
3.  **Basic Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a general understanding of file system permissions, web servers, Windows services, and DLL loading mechanisms.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Sage 300 versions between 2017 (6.4) and 2022 (6.9) due to the use of "C:\Sage\Sage300" as the default installation folder, with the vulnerability potentially going back to 2006 based on documentation.
*   Sage declined to publish an official advisory, citing issues with partner modules. The vulnerability was addressed in version 2023.
*   The article provides a step-by-step guide for manually fixing the folder permissions.
*   The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require user interaction beyond normal operation of the system and its services and web applications.

This content provides more detailed information about the vulnerability, its exploitation, and remediation than a standard CVE description would usually provide.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability arises from the Sage 300 ERP installer **failing to set explicit permissions** on the installation directory ("C:\Sage\Sage300\Runtime"). This results in the directory inheriting weak permissions from its parent, making it writable by unprivileged users. This aligns precisely with CWE-278 [Insecure Preserved Inherited Permissions], where a product inherits insecure permissions for an object without user awareness. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the installer places the program files in a directory that inherits permissions allowing modification by any authenticated user. This is the root cause of the issue, making CWE-278 the primary weakness. CWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element] is a secondary weakness because the installer adds the weakly-permissioned directory to the system's PATH, enabling **DLL search-order hijacking**, as stated in the "Vulnerability Description." Although CWE-269 [Improper Privilege Management] could seem relevant due to the impact being privilege escalation, it is too broad and discouraged according to MITRE's mapping guidance.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-278 [Insecure Preserved Inherited Permissions] is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the permission inheritance issue. It does not have direct relationships in the provided data. CWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element] is a base-level CWE and does not have any direct relationships in the provided data.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

### Extended Description


Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as "/tmp" or the current working directory.


In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:


  - the directory from which the program has been loaded

  - the current working directory

In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.

One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.


In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.


In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.


### Alternative Terms
DLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Binary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Insecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Dependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a "substitution attack."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Hard-code the search path to a set of known-safe values (such as system directories), or only allow them to be specified by the administrator in a configuration file. Do not allow these settings to be modified by an external party. Be careful to avoid related weaknesses such as CWE-426 and CWE-428.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When invoking other programs, specify those programs using fully-qualified pathnames. While this is an effective approach, code that uses fully-qualified pathnames might not be portable to other systems that do not use the same pathnames. The portability can be improved by locating the full-qualified paths in a centralized, easily-modifiable location within the source code, and having the code refer to these paths.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Remove or restrict all environment settings before invoking other programs. This includes the PATH environment variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and other settings that identify the location of code libraries, and any application-specific search paths.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).

**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.
- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious "..exe" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH
- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched



## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ParentOf -> CWE-250
ParentOf -> CWE-266
ParentOf -> CWE-267
ParentOf -> CWE-268
ParentOf -> CWE-270
ParentOf -> CWE-271
ParentOf -> CWE-274
ParentOf -> CWE-648

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** Consider following the principle of separation of privilege. Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting access to a system resource.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.



## CWE-278: Insecure Preserved Inherited Permissions
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A product inherits a set of insecure permissions for an object, e.g. when copying from an archive file, without user awareness or involvement.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-732

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Operation
- **Description:** Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Separation of Privilege
- **Description:** 

Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.


Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-1724:** Does not obey specified permissions when exporting.
