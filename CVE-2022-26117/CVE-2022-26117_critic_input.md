## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26117:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an unprotected MySQL root account in FortiNAC. The MySQL database used by FortiNAC has no password set, allowing any local user to connect to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a password for the MySQL root user, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The system is configured with an insecure default setting for the MySQL database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification/Corruption:** An attacker with local access can connect to the database and modify or corrupt its data, potentially leading to an unstable or non-functional FortiNAC solution.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can retrieve tokens from database tables, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Unauthorized Command Execution:** The Fortiguard article mentions "Execute unauthorized code or commands" which could be a secondary impact by modifying the underlying data of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required for exploitation, the database is accessible only through localhost.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local unprivileged user account on the FortiNAC system.
- The attacker must be able to execute commands via the CLI of the FortiNAC system.

**Additional Details:**
- The Github advisory provides a simple Proof of Concept by showing how a local user can connect using `mysql -u root`.
- Affected versions include a wide range of FortiNAC versions from 8.3.7 up to 9.2.3.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity, with a CVSS score of 8.8 in the github advisory and 8.0 in the Fortiguard article.

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-258: Empty Password in Configuration File
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Using an empty string as a password is insecure.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-260
ChildOf -> CWE-521

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** System Configuration
- **Description:** Passwords should be at least eight characters long -- the longer the better. Avoid passwords that are in any way similar to other passwords you have. Avoid using words that may be found in a dictionary, names book, on a map, etc. Consider incorporating numbers and/or punctuation into your password. If you do use common words, consider replacing letters in that word with numbers and punctuation. However, do not use "similar-looking" punctuation. For example, it is not a good idea to change cat to c@t, ca+, (@+, or anything similar. Finally, it is never appropriate to use an empty string as a password.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-26117:** Network access control (NAC) product has a configuration file with an empty password



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1391
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-344
ChildOf -> CWE-671
PeerOf -> CWE-257
ParentOf -> CWE-259
ParentOf -> CWE-321

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

For outbound authentication: store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].


In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** If the product must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access
