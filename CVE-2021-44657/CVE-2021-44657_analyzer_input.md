# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-44657

## Vulnerability Description
In StackStorm versions prior to 3.6.0, the jinja interpreter was not run in sandbox mode and thus allows execution of unsafe system commands. Jinja does not enable sandboxed mode by default due to backwards compatibility. Stackstorm now sets sandboxed mode for jinja by default.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** execution of unsafe system commands
- **vector:** unsafe system commands
- **product:** StackStorm
- **version:** prior to 3.6.0
- **component:** jinja interpreter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44657:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the Jinja2 template engine, which was exploited in StackStorm versions prior to 3.6.0.  The root cause is that the Jinja2 interpreter was not running in a sandboxed environment, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Jinja2 template engine was not configured to run in a sandboxed environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Lack of Sandboxing:** The primary weakness was the absence of a sandbox for the Jinja2 template interpreter. This allowed the execution of arbitrary Python code embedded within the templates.
-   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  Attackers could inject malicious Jinja2 template code. This allowed the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
-   **Direct Access to `os` Module:** The vulnerability permitted direct access to the `os` module through the template engine, enabling the execution of system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allowed attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, the ability to run system commands as the `st2` user could lead to privilege escalation, if the `st2` user has elevated privileges or access to sensitive data.
-   **Data Breach/Loss:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive data, modify configurations, or cause service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Template Injection:** Attackers inject malicious Jinja2 template code into areas where template rendering occurs.
- **Control of Template Content:** Exploitation requires the attacker to control the content of Jinja2 templates. This can occur in different ways:
    -  **CLI/API/Web UI/Workflows:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the StackStorm instance through any of these means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid account and be logged into the StackStorm instance through CLI, API, Web UI, or Workflows.
-   **Control over Template Content:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate template data.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to call `os.popen('id')` or other functions without explicit registration using the Jinja2 template engine.
- The PoC uses a Jinja2 template that iterates through subclasses, finds `catch_warnings`, and leverages `func_globals` to access a dictionary containing `eval`, allowing arbitrary code execution.
- The vulnerability is demonstrated by showing how to access the `os` module, and run system commands using `os.popen()` within the Jinja2 template, with or without the use of the `__builtins__` object.

**Mitigation:**

-   **Sandboxing:** The fix introduced in StackStorm v3.6.0 involves running the Jinja interpreter in a sandboxed environment, preventing access to unsafe system commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially reported in 2016, but wasn't fully addressed until later.
*   The vulnerability is similar to format string vulnerabilities in Python, as both allow access to object properties for code execution.
*   The vulnerability is context-independent due to the use of `_TemplateReference__context`, which bypasses the need to use `__builtins__`.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it was addressed.
