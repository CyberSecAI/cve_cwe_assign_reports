# Critic Input for CVE-2021-23997



# Original Analyzer Input
## Vulnerability Description
Due to **unexpected data type conversions**, a **use-after-free** could have occurred when interacting with the font cache. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unexpected data type conversions**
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **impact:** run arbitrary code
- **product:** Firefox
- **version:** < 88
- **component:** font cache

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of font sizes after a change to use floating-point numbers for font sizes. This change, introduced by bug 1646224, caused issues when a large SVG transform matrix resulted in a NaN (Not a Number) font inflation factor. This NaN value was then used in font variation comparisons, causing fonts not to be properly removed from the font cache when they should be.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free (UAF):** Due to the stale entry in the font cache, a freed font object could be accessed later. Specifically, a heap-use-after-free occurs in `gfxFont.h GetUnicodeRangeMap` when the font cache attempts to compare against the stale entry.
- **Incorrect Data Type Conversions**: The move to floating point values for font sizes, combined with the way these values were used in font comparisons, led to the NaN values not being handled correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free could lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting or reading from memory that has been freed.
- **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash due to the memory corruption.
- **Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution:** It's presumed with enough effort the use-after-free could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Page Loading:** By loading a malicious webpage crafted with SVG elements and CSS that trigger the NaN font inflation factor.
- **User Interaction:** Additional user interaction like zooming and reloading increase the likelihood of exploitation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Serve Malicious Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a crafted HTML page that can be accessed through Firefox.
- **Some User Interaction (optional):** While the initial trigger is just loading the page, additional interactions (like zooming or reloading) can make it more reliable and may be required to reach the non-UAF crashing address.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is a regression introduced by bug 1646224.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the font cache and involves the comparison of font variation values.
- The issue was fixed by normalizing font sizes and switching to bitwise equality for font variation value comparisons.
- Test cases were developed to reproduce both UAF and non-UAF crashes.
- It's noted that the freed memory can be overwritten before being reused due to the nature of how the font cache is managed.
- While the initial vulnerability was marked as `sec-moderate`, it was later raised to `sec-high` due to the possibility of overwriting the memory before reuse and potentially arbitrary code execution.
-The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 88 and later versions.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly states a **use-after-free** condition in the font cache of Firefox. This aligns directly with CWE-416 (Use After Free), which describes the scenario where a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating that a heap-use-after-free occurs in `gfxFont.h GetUnicodeRangeMap`. The description also indicates **unexpected data type conversions** from floating-point font sizes leading to NaN values, which contributes to fonts not being properly removed from the cache. This aligns with CWE-681 (Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types), where incorrect data type conversions result in unexpected values. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is preferred and the description matches the weakness. CWE-681 is a secondary weakness as it's the root cause that triggers the use-after-free. Both CWEs are listed as ALLOWED in the mapping guidance.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiry). The vulnerability in question clearly involves using a resource (memory) after it has been freed, making CWE-416 a more specific and appropriate choice than its parent.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "use-after-free" and supporting technical details about the font cache mechanism)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-23997**: Due to unexpected data type conversions, a use-after-free could have occurred when interacting with the font cache. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.
- **CVE-2021-37645**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126) uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-37646**: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L184) calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies negative `ngram_widths`. The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
- **CVE-2021-44499**: An issue was discovered in FIS GT.M through V7.0-000 (related to the YottaDB code base). Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a call to $Extract to force an signed integer holding the size of a buffer to take on a large negative number, which is then used as the length of a memcpy call that occurs on the stack, causing a buffer overflow.

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
