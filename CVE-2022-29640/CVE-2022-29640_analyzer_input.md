# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-29640

## Vulnerability Description
TOTOLINK A3100R V4.1.2cu.5050_B20200504 and V4.1.2cu.5247_B20211129 were discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the comment parameter in the function setPortForwardRules. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted POST request.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `setPortForwardRules` function in the `firewall.so` module of the TOTOLINK A3100R router firmware is vulnerable due to a lack of input validation on the "comment" parameter. Specifically, the code uses `strcpy` to copy the user-provided "comment" into a stack buffer without checking its length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow caused by the unbounded `strcpy` operation. If the length of the "comment" parameter exceeds the allocated buffer size on the stack, it will overwrite adjacent memory, leading to undefined behavior and potentially denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates a denial of service. By sending a crafted POST request with an oversized "comment" field, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow, causing the router to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with the `topicurl` set to `setting/setPortForwardRules`. The oversized comment is included within the JSON data in the POST body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface. This could be within the local network, or, if the web interface is exposed, from the internet.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint and the structure of the request that contains the vulnerable parameter.
- **Ability to send HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP POST requests with a custom body and headers.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides specific firmware versions that are vulnerable, `V4.1.2cu.5050_B20200504` and `V4.1.2cu.5247_B20211129`.
- The content gives a link to download the vulnerable firmware.
- The PoC demonstrates how to trigger the overflow by using a long string of 'a' characters as the comment parameter.
-  The provided screenshots visually highlight the vulnerable code and its surrounding context.
- The content includes a complete HTTP request example, including necessary headers, JSON payload, and the oversized comment payload.
