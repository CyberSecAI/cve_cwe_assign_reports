# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-28796

## Vulnerability Description
jbd2_journal_wait_updates in fs/jbd2/transaction.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.1 has a **use-after-free** caused by a transaction_t **race condition**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** before 5.17.1
- **component:** fs/jbd2/transaction.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `jbd2_journal_wait_updates()` function of the Linux kernel's journaling block device (jbd2) subsystem. This function is called while holding the `j_state_lock`. However, if a commit is in progress, the transaction associated with `journal->j_running_transaction` might be committed and freed via `jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()` -> `jbd2_journal_free_transaction()` when the `j_state_lock` is released. This can result in a use-after-free scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The code accesses the `transaction_t` structure after it has been freed.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the `jbd2_journal_wait_updates()` function and the transaction commit process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A use-after-free can cause the system to crash.
*   **Information Disclosure:** It's possible that the freed memory contains sensitive information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, use-after-free vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the normal operation of the jbd2 journaling system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The NetApp advisory indicates that this vulnerability can be exploited with low privileges. The CVSS vector confirms that local access is required `AV:L`
*  **Specific conditions**: Triggering this vulnerability requires a specific timing of events with the jbd2 journaling system.

**Additional Notes**

*   The commit message from the Linux kernel source code provides good details on the root cause and fix for this issue.
*   The fix involves checking for `journal->j_running_transaction` every time the `j_state_lock` is released and reacquired within the loop to avoid a use-after-free issue.
*   The NetApp advisory lists several affected products including "Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere", "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)", "NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS)" and "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node" and "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Storage Node".
*   The advisory states that NetApp is aware of public discussion regarding the vulnerability.
