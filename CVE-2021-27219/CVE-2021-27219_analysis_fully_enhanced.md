|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**integer overflow** on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits" in the `g_bytes_new` function, leading to memory corruption. This directly aligns with CWE-190 [Integer Overflow or Wraparound]. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further reinforces this by mentioning "Integer overflow in the `g_bytes_new` function due to an implicit cast from 64-bit `gsize` to 32-bit `guint` when calling `g_memdup`." The impact is "memory corruption," which is a typical consequence of integer overflows when used to calculate buffer sizes. While other CWEs like CWE-131 [Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size] or CWE-789 [Uncontrolled Memory Allocation] could be considered, CWE-190 is the most direct root cause. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-190 indicates this is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-190 is a Base level CWE. It can lead to other weaknesses such as buffer overflows (CWE-119) and memory corruption. CWE-131 [Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size] and CWE-789 [Uncontrolled Memory Allocation] are consequences in the vulnerability description.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High evidence from technical description and CVE reference materials)



## Known Examples for CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43537): Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668): Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0545): Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.
- **CVE-2021-30860** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30860](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30860): Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-30663** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-30663): Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2018-10887** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10887): Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **CVE-2019-1010006** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1010006): Chain: compiler optimization (CWE-733) removes or modifies code used to detect integer overflow (CWE-190), allowing out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **CVE-2010-1866** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1866): Chain: integer overflow (CWE-190) causes a negative signed value, which later bypasses a maximum-only check (CWE-839), leading to heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **CVE-2010-2753** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2753): Chain: integer overflow leads to use-after-free
- **CVE-2005-1513** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1513): Chain: integer overflow in securely-coded mail program leads to buffer overflow. In 2005, this was regarded as unrealistic to exploit, but in 2020, it was rediscovered to be easier to exploit due to evolutions of the technology.
