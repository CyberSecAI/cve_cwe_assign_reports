# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-27219

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has an **integer overflow** on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to memory corruption.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** memory corruption
- **product:** GNOME GLib
- **version:** before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3
- **component:** g_bytes_new function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Integer overflow in the `g_bytes_new` function due to an implicit cast from 64-bit `gsize` to 32-bit `guint` when calling `g_memdup`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the implicit cast causing an overflow when a large size value is passed to `g_bytes_new` on a 64-bit system. This results in `g_memdup` allocating a much smaller buffer than intended.
- **Memory Corruption:** The overflow causes `g_bytes_new` to return a `GBytes` object that claims to hold a large buffer, but it actually holds a significantly smaller one. This mismatch can lead to memory corruption issues when the application uses the returned `GBytes` object with the expected larger size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The most serious impact is the potential for memory corruption when applications attempt to use the incorrectly sized buffer. This could lead to various issues, including crashes, data corruption, or potentially, code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** In the provided Proof of Concept (PoC), the overflow caused a crash with a `SIGABRT`, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Although no specific code execution exploit is described in the provided content, it is explicitly stated that there is a risk that the memory corruption could be used for code execution in an application using GLib.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Calling `g_bytes_new` with a large size parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `g_bytes_new` function is called with a `size` parameter that, when implicitly cast to a 32-bit integer, will cause an integer overflow.
- **Triggering via SUID binary:** The provided PoC demonstrates triggering the overflow by sending a large "cookie" to `polkit-agent-helper-1`, which is a SUID binary. This highlights that vulnerable code can be reached through system services that may have elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to call `g_bytes_new`:** An attacker needs the ability to influence the size parameter when calling `g_bytes_new`.
- **Local or Remote Access:** Exploitation can be triggered locally (via the PoC) or remotely through vulnerable services.
- **Understanding of affected applications:** To develop a more targeted and potentially code-executing exploit, an attacker would need to understand how the vulnerable GLib function is used within a specific application.

**Additional Details:**

- **PoC:** A proof-of-concept was provided which triggers an assertion failure and causes a crash in `polkit-agent-helper-1`.
- **Wide usage:**  GLib is a widely used library, making this a critical vulnerability to address.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in GLib by changing the type of the `byte_size` parameter of `g_memdup`.

In summary, CVE-2021-27219 describes an integer overflow vulnerability in GLib's `g_bytes_new` function, which could lead to memory corruption, DoS, or potentially code execution. It is triggered by passing an excessively large size parameter, and due to GLib's widespread use, many applications are potentially vulnerable.
