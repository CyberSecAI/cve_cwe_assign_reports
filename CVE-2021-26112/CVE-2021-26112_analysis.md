## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.00
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that there are multiple **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerabilities [**CWE-121**] in FortiWAN. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, confirming that **stack-based buffer overflows** [**CWE-121**] are the root cause of the vulnerability. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-121, which describes a buffer overflow condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. The impact of the vulnerability is that an unauthenticated attacker can corrupt control data in memory and execute arbitrary code by sending specifically crafted requests.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). While CWE-120 could be considered, the explicit mention of "stack-based" makes CWE-121 a more specific and appropriate choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.00 (The vulnerability description explicitly identifies CWE-121 as the weakness.)
