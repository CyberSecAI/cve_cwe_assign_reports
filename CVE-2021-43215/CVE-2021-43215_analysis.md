# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.85 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

| CWE-843 | Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') | 0.50 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description mentions "**memory corruption**" which can lead to remote code execution. Among the suggested CWEs, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) directly addresses memory corruption issues. The description doesn't provide specific details on how the memory is corrupted, but the impact (remote code execution) aligns with potential consequences of an out-of-bounds write. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent of CWE-787, the specific nature of the memory corruption suggests an out-of-bounds write is more appropriate. The retriever results also list CWE-787 with a high score and the usage is "Allowed." CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')) are also relevant since integer overflows can lead to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes, and Type Confusion can also lead to memory corruption.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a base CWE and is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It can also follow CWE-824 (Access of Resource Using Initalized Memory). CWE-190 is PeerOf CWE-128 (Wrap-around Error). CWE-843 is child of CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.85 (Based on the vulnerability description mentioning memory corruption and the impact of remote code execution. The retriever results also support this selection)
