### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **off-by-one array size check**
- **product:** GNU Libtasn1
- **version:** before 4.19.0
- **component:** asn1_encode_simple_der

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46848:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-46848" and describes an out-of-bounds read issue in `libtasn1`, aligning with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from an incorrect bound check within the `ETYPE_OK` macro used in the `asn1_encode_simple_der` function of libtasn1. The check was using `<=` instead of `<` when comparing the `etype` value with the size of the `_asn1_tags` array.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds Read:** The flawed bound check allows an attacker to supply an `etype` value that is equal to `_asn1_tags_size`, causing an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `_asn1_tags` array.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Reading out of bounds could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from memory.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** While less likely, a carefully crafted out-of-bounds read could potentially cause a crash or other unexpected behavior, resulting in a denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The vulnerability is triggered during the encoding of ASN.1 data through the `asn1_encode_simple_der` function. Specifically, the `etype` parameter provided to the function is used in the flawed bounds check.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to Control `etype`:** An attacker must be able to control or influence the `etype` value passed to the `asn1_encode_simple_der` function. This implies a position where the attacker is able to provide input to an application using `libtasn1`.
    - No specific privilege level is explicitly mentioned, suggesting the attacker may be an unauthenticated user in some cases.

**Additional details from the content:**
  - The vulnerable code is located in `lib/coding.c` of `libtasn1`, specifically around line 218 of the `asn1_encode_simple_der` function in version 4.16.0.
  - The fix involves changing the check from `(etype) <= _asn1_tags_size` to `(etype) < _asn1_tags_size`.
  - Various distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian were affected.
  - Patches or updates for `libtasn1` version 4.19.0 and later contain the fix.
  - NetApp products were analyzed for this vulnerability, and none were found to be affected.
  - A test case to reproduce the crash was provided in one of the documents.

In summary, CVE-2021-46848 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the libtasn1 library due to an off-by-one error in the `ETYPE_OK` macro. This can be exploited by providing a crafted `etype` parameter to `asn1_encode_simple_der`, leading to potential information disclosure or a denial of service.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that GNU Libtasn1 before 4.19.0 has an ETYPE_OK **off-by-one array size check** that affects asn1_encode_simple_der." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating, "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect bound check within the `ETYPE_OK` macro used in the `asn1_encode_simple_der` function of libtasn1. The check was using `<=` instead of `<` when comparing the `etype` value with the size of the `_asn1_tags` array." This aligns directly with CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error). Furthermore, the consequence of this error is an out-of-bounds read, which corresponds to CWE-125. The MITRE mapping guidance allows both CWE-193 and CWE-125.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-193 is the root cause of the vulnerability and directly leads to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The graph relationships do not provide specific chains for CWE-193 or CWE-125, but the inherent nature of an off-by-one error causing an out-of-bounds read establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "off-by-one error" and clear description of the out-of-bounds read consequence in the vulnerability details and CVE summary)

**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
off-by-five: An "off-by-five" error was reported for sudo in 2002 (CVE-2002-0184), but that is more like a "length calculation" error.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-617
CanPrecede -> CWE-170
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
