# Analysis for CVE-2021-46848

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.95 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one error in the array size check, which leads to an out-of-bounds read. |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.70 | Base | Allowed | The off-by-one error results in reading data past the end of the intended buffer. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description states that GNU Libtasn1 before 4.19.0 has an ETYPE_OK **off-by-one array size check** that affects asn1_encode_simple_der." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating, "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect bound check within the `ETYPE_OK` macro used in the `asn1_encode_simple_der` function of libtasn1. The check was using `<=` instead of `<` when comparing the `etype` value with the size of the `_asn1_tags` array." This aligns directly with CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error). Furthermore, the consequence of this error is an out-of-bounds read, which corresponds to CWE-125. The MITRE mapping guidance allows both CWE-193 and CWE-125.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-193 is the root cause of the vulnerability and directly leads to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The graph relationships do not provide specific chains for CWE-193 or CWE-125, but the inherent nature of an off-by-one error causing an out-of-bounds read establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to explicit mention of "off-by-one error" and clear description of the out-of-bounds read consequence in the vulnerability details and CVE summary)
