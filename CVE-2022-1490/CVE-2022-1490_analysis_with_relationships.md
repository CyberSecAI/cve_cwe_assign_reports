## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in Browser Switcher" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the "**Root cause of vulnerability** is **use-after-free**". The description of CWE-416 (Use After Free) precisely matches this: "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed." The vulnerability also results in "**heap corruption**", which is a typical consequence of use-after-free. The Retriever Results also list CWE-416 as the top match with a high combined score. The "Usage: Allowed" mapping guidance reinforces this choice.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE. There are no direct relationships that influence the mapping in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (The vulnerability description directly mentions "use after free", and the CVE summary confirms it as the root cause.)
