## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability description clearly states a **stack overflow** vulnerability in the Tenda AC9 v15.03.2.21 within the SetStaticRoutecfg function due to the 'list' parameter. This directly corresponds to CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack. The description lacks specifics to further refine the CWE, but the core issue is undeniably a stack overflow. The retriever results also list CWE-121 with a high score. CWE-787 is the primary match, but since this is a stack overflow, CWE-121 is more specific."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a broader class. There are no specific chain relationships identified here, but stack overflows can lead to various consequences, such as arbitrary code execution."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.95 (High confidence due to direct mention of stack overflow in the description)
