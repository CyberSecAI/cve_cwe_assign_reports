# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-26315

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-252 | Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates **insufficient verification of the integrity of decrypted image**, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The CVE reference summary highlights the **improper decryption implementation** and **inadequate protection of the off-chip firmware decryption process**. This aligns with CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature), because the core issue is failing to properly validate the cryptographic signature of the decrypted firmware image. The lack of proper verification allows for the possibility of arbitrary code execution if the image has been tampered with. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-347 indicates that this mapping is ALLOWED.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-347 is a Base level CWE and doesn't have direct relationships in the provided data. However, it can be conceptually related to other cryptographic weaknesses, such as CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) or CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), but these are not directly implicated by the current vulnerability description. CWE-347 focuses specifically on signature verification, making it the most relevant choice. CWE-252 is included as a secondary candidate due to the fact that **insufficient verification of the integrity of decrypted image** could be interpreted as missing an exceptional condition check.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference materials, specifically mentioning improper decryption and signature verification.)

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-21405**: Lotus is an Implementation of the Filecoin protocol written in Go. BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: "serialized", and "compressed", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.
- **CVE-2020-23533**: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.
- **CVE-2021-0152**: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.
- **CVE-2021-21238**: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
- **CVE-2021-21239**: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
- **CVE-2021-22708**: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.
