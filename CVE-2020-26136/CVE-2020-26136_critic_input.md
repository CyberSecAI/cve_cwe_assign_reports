# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-308 | Use of Single-factor Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability explicitly states that MFA is bypassed due to the acceptance of basic authentication, directly aligning with the use of single-factor authentication. |
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The GraphQL module provides an alternate path (basic authentication) that bypasses the intended MFA, fitting the description of authentication bypass via an alternate channel. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The GraphQL endpoint is missing proper authentication mechanisms that would prevent bypassing MFA. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the fact that the GraphQL module in Silverstripe allows basic authentication which bypasses MFA. This directly corresponds to **CWE-308 (Use of Single-factor Authentication)**, as basic authentication serves as a single factor, negating the intended multi-factor security. The CVE description mentions that the GraphQL module accepts basic authentication by default, leading to the **MFA bypass**. The root cause is the **lack of enforcement of MFA** when basic authentication is used. CWE-308 is a Base level CWE and the mapping guidance indicates it is ALLOWED. This mapping is very precise, as it focuses on the specific authentication failure.
  CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is also relevant as the GraphQL module offers an alternate authentication path (basic authentication) that circumvents MFA.
  CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a secondary candidate, because the GraphQL endpoint is not properly secured to enforce MFA when basic authentication is used.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-308 does not have direct relationships to the other potential CWEs. CWE-288 does not have any relationships. CWE-306 is a peer of CWE-288, however no relationship exists between CWE-306 and CWE-308.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of MFA bypass via basic authentication and clear root cause description)

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Funnel all access through a single choke point to simplify how users can access a resource. For every access, perform a check to determine if the user has permissions to access the resource.



### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** overlaps Unprotected Alternate Channel



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1179:** Router allows remote attackers to read system logs without authentication by directly connecting to the login screen and typing certain control characters.

## CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise when compared with the benefits of a dual-factor authentication scheme.

### Extended Description
While the use of multiple authentication schemes is simply piling on more complexity on top of authentication, it is inestimably valuable to have such measures of redundancy. The use of weak, reused, and common passwords is rampant on the internet. Without the added protection of multiple authentication schemes, a single mistake can result in the compromise of an account. For this reason, if multiple schemes are possible and also easy to use, they should be implemented and required.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-654
PeerOf -> CWE-309

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Use multiple independent authentication schemes, which ensures that -- if one of the methods is compromised -- the system itself is still likely safe from compromise.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication



## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Divide the software into anonymous, normal, privileged, and administrative areas. Identify which of these areas require a proven user identity, and use a centralized authentication capability.


Identify all potential communication channels, or other means of interaction with the software, to ensure that all channels are appropriately protected, including those channels that are assumed to be accessible only by authorized parties. Developers sometimes perform authentication at the primary channel, but open up a secondary channel that is assumed to be private. For example, a login mechanism may be listening on one network port, but after successful authentication, it may open up a second port where it waits for the connection, but avoids authentication because it assumes that only the authenticated party will connect to the port.


In general, if the software or protocol allows a single session or user state to persist across multiple connections or channels, authentication and appropriate credential management need to be used throughout.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** 

Where possible, avoid implementing custom, "grow-your-own" authentication routines and consider using authentication capabilities as provided by the surrounding framework, operating system, or environment. These capabilities may avoid common weaknesses that are unique to authentication; support automatic auditing and tracking; and make it easier to provide a clear separation between authentication tasks and authorization tasks.


In environments such as the World Wide Web, the line between authentication and authorization is sometimes blurred. If custom authentication routines are required instead of those provided by the server, then these routines must be applied to every single page, since these pages could be requested directly.





### Observed Examples
