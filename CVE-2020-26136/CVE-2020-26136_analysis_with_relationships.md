# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-26136 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-308 | Use of Single-factor Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability explicitly states that MFA is bypassed due to the acceptance of basic authentication, directly aligning with the use of single-factor authentication. |
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The GraphQL module provides an alternate path (basic authentication) that bypasses the intended MFA, fitting the description of authentication bypass via an alternate channel. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The GraphQL endpoint is missing proper authentication mechanisms that would prevent bypassing MFA. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability lies in the fact that the GraphQL module in Silverstripe allows basic authentication which bypasses MFA. This directly corresponds to **CWE-308 (Use of Single-factor Authentication)**, as basic authentication serves as a single factor, negating the intended multi-factor security. The CVE description mentions that the GraphQL module accepts basic authentication by default, leading to the **MFA bypass**. The root cause is the **lack of enforcement of MFA** when basic authentication is used. CWE-308 is a Base level CWE and the mapping guidance indicates it is ALLOWED. This mapping is very precise, as it focuses on the specific authentication failure.
  CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is also relevant as the GraphQL module offers an alternate authentication path (basic authentication) that circumvents MFA.
  CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a secondary candidate, because the GraphQL endpoint is not properly secured to enforce MFA when basic authentication is used.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-308 does not have direct relationships to the other potential CWEs. CWE-288 does not have any relationships. CWE-306 is a peer of CWE-288, however no relationship exists between CWE-306 and CWE-308.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence due to explicit mention of MFA bypass via basic authentication and clear root cause description)
