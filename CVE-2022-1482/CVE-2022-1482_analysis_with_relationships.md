# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-1482 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates an **inappropriate implementation** in WebGL leading to **heap corruption**. This strongly suggests a memory corruption issue. The "Retriever Results" and "Top CWEs" from similar CVEs suggest CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). However, since the description mentions "**heap corruption**," CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is more specific and appropriate. The attack is triggered by a crafted HTML page, indicating a remote exploit. CWE-122 is a variant of buffer overflow that specifically targets the heap, which aligns with the vulnerability details.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It is also a parent of more specific overflows. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a related weakness as it can lead to heap corruption, but CWE-122 is more precise in this case.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from the vulnerability description focusing on heap corruption)
