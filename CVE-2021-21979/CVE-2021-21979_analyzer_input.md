# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2021-21979

## Vulnerability Description
In Bitnami Containers, all Laravel container versions prior to 6.20.0-debian-10-r107 for Laravel 6, 7.30.1-debian-10-r108 for Laravel 7 and 8.5.11-debian-10-r0 for Laravel 8, the file /tmp/app/.env is generated at the time that the docker image bitnami/laravel was built, and the value of APP_KEY is fixed under certain conditions. This value is crucial for the security of the application and must be randomly generated per Laravel installation. If your applications encryption key is in the hands of a malicious party, that party could craft cookie values using the encryption key and exploit vulnerabilities inherent to PHP object serialization / unserialization, such as calling arbitrary class methods within your application.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **predictable APP_KEY value**
- **impact:** arbitrary class method execution
- **vector:** exploiting vulnerabilities in PHP object serialization
- **attacker:** attacker with access to encryption key
- **product:** Bitnami Laravel containers
- **version:** ['prior to 6.20.0-debian-10-r107 for Laravel 6', '7.30.1-debian-10-r108 for Laravel 7', '8.5.11-debian-10-r0 for Laravel 8']
