# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2022-20057

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-390 | Detection of Error Condition Without Action | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* "The vulnerability is due to **incorrect error handling** leading to **memory corruption**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states 'CWE-390 Detection of Error Condition Without Action' as a weakness. This indicates that the system detects an error but doesn't take appropriate action, which is the root cause of the **memory corruption**. Therefore, CWE-390 is the primary CWE. CWE-131 is considered as a secondary candidate because **memory corruption** can arise from an **incorrect calculation of buffer size**, and CWE-787 as the result from **incorrect error handling** can lead to an **out-of-bounds write**."
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* "CWE-390 is a child of CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions), but CWE-390 is more specific since the description explicitly states that there is a 'Detection of Error Condition Without Action'. CWE-390 can precede CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) because not handling an error might result in memory not being released."

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - *Example:* Confidence: 0.8 (High evidence from CVE reference materials and good alignment with vulnerability description)

## Known Examples for CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-41151** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151): SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked for writing but the server tries to send an error
- **[REF-1374]** [https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards](https://www.unciphered.com/blog/randstorm-you-cant-patch-a-house-of-cards): Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)
- **CVE-2021-3011** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3011](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3011): virtual interrupt controller in a virtualization product allows crash of host by writing a certain invalid value to a register, which triggers a fatal error instead of returning an error code
- **CVE-2008-4302** [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4302](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4302): Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-0668**: In apusys, there is a possible memory corruption due to incorrect error handling. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05670521; Issue ID: ALPS05670521.
- **CVE-2021-38003**: Inappropriate implementation in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 95.0.4638.69 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.
- **CVE-2021-28165**: In Eclipse Jetty 7.2.2 to 9.4.38, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.1, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.1, CPU usage can reach 100% upon receiving a large invalid TLS frame.
- **CVE-2021-0297**: A vulnerability in the processing of TCP MD5 authentication in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a BGP or LDP session configured with MD5 authentication to succeed, even if the peer does not have TCP MD5 authentication enabled. This could lead to untrusted or unauthorized sessions being established, resulting in an impact on confidentiality or stability of the network. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.3R2-S1-EVO; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO. Juniper Networks Junos OS is not affected by this issue.
- **CVE-2021-36128**: An issue was discovered in the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. Autoblocks for CentralAuth-issued suppression blocks are not properly implemented.
- **CVE-2021-0319**: In checkCallerIsSystemOr of CompanionDeviceManagerService.java, there is a possible way to get a nearby Bluetooth device's MAC address without appropriate permissions due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege that grants access to nearby MAC addresses, with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Product: Android; Versions: Android-8.0, Android-8.1, Android-9, Android-10, Android-11; Android ID: A-167244818.
