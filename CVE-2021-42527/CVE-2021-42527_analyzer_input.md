## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42527:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer". This means the software attempts to read or write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds access (CWE-788):** The primary weakness is the potential to access memory outside the bounds of a buffer. This can lead to various problems depending on whether the access is a read or write operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, meaning an attacker could run malicious code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker needs to have some form of access to the target system.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning an attacker needs to trick the user into performing an action, such as opening a malicious file, to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability. (PR:N)
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to perform an action, such as opening a malicious file, to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The severity is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS base score of 7.8.
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Premiere Elements 2021 (build 19.0 (20210809.daily.2242976) and earlier) for both Windows and macOS.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Adobe Premiere Elements 2021 (build 19.0 (20211007.daily.2243969)).
*   The vulnerability was reported by (yjdfy) CQY of Topsec Alpha Team.
