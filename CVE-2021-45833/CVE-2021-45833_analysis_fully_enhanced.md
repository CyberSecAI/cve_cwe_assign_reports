# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-45833

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Stack-based Buffer Overflow**" as the **weakness**. This directly aligns with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a Variant-level CWE and is the most specific match for the provided information. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this by mentioning "Stack-based buffer overflow" as the root cause and vulnerability. Given the explicit nature of the description, CWE-121 is the primary CWE. The impact of exploitation is a Denial of Service, but the root cause is the overflow itself.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a Class-level CWE. Choosing CWE-121 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of "Stack-based Buffer Overflow" in the vulnerability description.)

---

- **Analysis and Justification:**
    - *Explanation:* CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')) is considered as a secondary candidate because a buffer copy operation without checking the size of input could be the underlying cause of the stack-based buffer overflow. However, without further details on the exact mechanism of the overflow, it's less certain than CWE-121. The "Retriever Results" also include CWE-120.
    - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-120 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-119. It can precede CWE-123 (Write What Where Condition). The mapping guidance for CWE-120 is "Allowed-with-Review," which requires caution as it can be misused if the vulnerability is simply reported as "buffer overflow." In this case, the explicit stack-based nature and the potential for a buffer copy operation justify its consideration as a secondary weakness.

- **Confidence Score:**
    - Confidence: 0.6 (Possible contributing factor, but not explicitly stated in the vulnerability description.)

- **CVE-2021-1965**: Possible buffer overflow due to lack of parameter length check during MBSSID scan IE parse in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking
- **CVE-2021-20699**: Sharp NEC Displays ((UN462A R1.300 and prior to it, UN462VA R1.300 and prior to it, UN492S R1.300 and prior to it, UN492VS R1.300 and prior to it, UN552A R1.300 and prior to it, UN552S R1.300 and prior to it, UN552VS R1.300 and prior to it, UN552 R1.300 and prior to it, UN552V R1.300 and prior to it, UX552S R1.300 and prior to it, UX552 R1.300 and prior to it, V864Q R2.000 and prior to it, C861Q R2.000 and prior to it, P754Q R2.000 and prior to it, V754Q R2.000 and prior to it, C751Q R2.000 and prior to it, V984Q R2.000 and prior to it, C981Q R2.000 and prior to it, P654Q R2.000 and prior to it, V654Q R2.000 and prior to it, C651Q R2.000 and prior to it, V554Q R2.000 and prior to it, P404 R3.200 and prior to it, P484 R3.200 and prior to it, P554 R3.200 and prior to it, V404 R3.200 and prior to it, V484 R3.200 and prior to it, V554 R3.200 and prior to it, V404-T R3.200 and prior to it, V484-T R3.200 and prior to it, V554-T R3.200 and prior to it, C501 R2.000 and prior to it, C551 R2.000 and prior to it, C431 R2.000 and prior to it) allows an attacker a buffer overflow and to execute remote code by sending long parameters that contains specific characters in http request.
- **CVE-2021-33909**: fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05.
- **CVE-2021-3420**: A flaw was found in newlib in versions prior to 4.0.0. Improper overflow validation in the memory allocation functions mEMALIGn, pvALLOc, nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc could case an integer overflow, leading to an allocation of a small buffer and then to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2021-22659**: Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Version 21.6 and below may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted Modbus packet allowing the attacker to retrieve or modify random values in the register. If successfully exploited, this may lead to a buffer overflow resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The FAULT LED will flash RED and communications may be lost. Recovery from denial-of-service condition requires the fault to be cleared by the user.
