# Fully Enhanced Analysis for Critic Review - CVE-2021-29679

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-97 | Improper Neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSI) Within a Web Page | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Data | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states that the IBM Cognos Analytics software **incorrectly neutralizes user-controlled input** that could be interpreted as a server-side include (SSI) directive. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-97, which is "Improper Neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSI) Within a Web Page". The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to execute code remotely. The **root cause** is the improper neutralization. This directly matches the weakness described by CWE-97.
  - *Explanation:* Although not explicitly stated, **improper encoding or escaping** is a plausible contributing factor to the improper neutralization mentioned in the vulnerability description. CWE-116 is "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Data". While the description doesn't directly confirm encoding issues, the nature of SSI injection often involves the lack of proper encoding.
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-97 is a Variant of other higher level CWEs. CWE-116 is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.

- **Confidence Score:**
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions server-side includes and improper neutralization.)

## Known Examples for CWE-97: Improper Neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSI) Within a Web Page
### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-29679**: IBM Cognos Analytics 11.1.7 and 11.2.0 could allow an authenticated user to execute code remotely due to incorrectly neutralizaing user-contrlled input that could be interpreted a a server-side include (SSI) directive. IBM X-Force ID: 199915.
- **CVE-2022-43660**: Improper neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSW) within a web page in Movable Type series allows a remote authenticated attacker with Privilege of 'Manage of Content Types' may execute an arbitrary Perl script and/or an arbitrary OS command. Affected products/versions are as follows: Movable Type 7 r.5301 and earlier (Movable Type 7 Series), Movable Type Advanced 7 r.5301 and earlier (Movable Type Advanced 7 Series), Movable Type Premium 1.53 and earlier, and Movable Type Premium Advanced 1.53 and earlier.

### Top 25 Examples
- **CVE-2021-20195**: A flaw was found in keycloak in versions before 13.0.0. A Self Stored XSS attack vector escalating to a complete account takeover is possible due to user-supplied data fields not being properly encoded and Javascript code being used to process the data. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
