### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **cipher leak**
- **product:** ImageMagick
- **version:** before 7.0.11
- **component:** calculate signatures in TransformSignature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a potential cipher leak within the `TransformSignature` function located in `MagickCore/signature.c`. Specifically, the issue occurs during the calculation of signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cipher Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a potential leak of sensitive cipher data. This suggests that during the signature calculation process, some of the cipher's internal state or intermediate values might be exposed.
*   The code uses `memset` to clear the `W` array but this can be optimized away by the compiler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality:** The most significant impact of this vulnerability is a breach of data confidentiality. If an attacker can successfully exploit the cipher leak, they might gain access to sensitive information that is supposed to be protected by the cipher.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Image Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted image file to an application using ImageMagick, triggering the vulnerable signature calculation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Submit Crafted Files:** An attacker needs to be able to submit a specially crafted image file to a system that uses a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This means the attacker needs to be able to interact with software or systems that use ImageMagick to process images.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit log shows changes in `MagickCore/signature.c` where `memset` is replaced with `ResetMagickMemory`.  Additionally, `MagickCore/memory.c` was changed to define `ResetMagickMemory` using a volatile pointer to prevent compiler optimizations.
*   The issue was fixed in ImageMagick version 7.0.11.
*   The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE is related to a potential cipher leak in the `TransformSignature` function.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the cipher leak in `MagickCore/signature.c`.
*  The fix prevents compiler optimizations from removing the buffer clearing

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description indicates a potential **cipher leak** due to the compiler potentially optimizing away the `memset` call used to clear the `W` array. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the issue was addressed by replacing `memset` with `ResetMagickMemory` and defining `ResetMagickMemory` using a volatile pointer to prevent compiler optimizations. This directly aligns with CWE-14 (Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers), which describes the scenario where sensitive memory is cleared in the source code, but compiler optimizations remove the clearing operation. The core issue is not simply an out-of-bounds read or write, or a general cryptographic issue, but specifically the compiler's optimization interfering with security-sensitive memory clearing. The "Usage: Allowed" mapping guidance for CWE-14 supports this choice.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* While other CWEs like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) were suggested by the retriever, they do not precisely capture the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the compiler's optimization removing the memory clearing operation. Therefore, CWE-14 is the most accurate and specific classification.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.9 (High confidence based on the vulnerability description, CVE reference summary, and alignment with CWE-14's definition.)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

When there is a need to store or transmit sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data. Select a well-vetted algorithm that is currently considered to be strong by experts in the field, and use well-tested implementations. As with all cryptographic mechanisms, the source code should be available for analysis.


For example, US government systems require FIPS 140-2 certification [REF-1192].


Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.


Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong. [REF-267]


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Description:** Ensure that the design allows one cryptographic algorithm to be replaced with another in the next generation or version. Where possible, use wrappers to make the interfaces uniform. This will make it easier to upgrade to stronger algorithms. With hardware, design the product at the Intellectual Property (IP) level so that one cryptographic algorithm can be replaced with another in the next generation of the hardware product.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys (see CWE-320). If the keys can be guessed or stolen, then the strength of the cryptography itself is irrelevant.



### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.



## CWE-14: Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
Sensitive memory is cleared according to the source code, but compiler optimizations leave the memory untouched when it is not read from again, aka "dead store removal."

### Extended Description


This compiler optimization error occurs when:


  1. Secret data are stored in memory.

  1. The secret data are scrubbed from memory by overwriting its contents.

  1. The source code is compiled using an optimizing compiler, which identifies and removes the function that overwrites the contents as a dead store because the memory is not used subsequently.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-733

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Description:** Store the sensitive data in a "volatile" memory location if available.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Build and Compilation
- **Description:** If possible, configure your compiler so that it does not remove dead stores.

**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Description:** Where possible, encrypt sensitive data that are used by a software system.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Requirements
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** 

Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.


Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Libraries or Frameworks
- **Description:** 

Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.


Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.


**Mitigation 3:**
- **Phase:** Operation, Build and Compilation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Environment Hardening
- **Description:** 

Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. 


 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail. 





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Strategy:** Input Validation
- **Description:** 

Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.


When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."


Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.


To reduce the likelihood of introducing an out-of-bounds read, ensure that you validate and ensure correct calculations for any length argument, buffer size calculation, or offset. Be especially careful of relying on a sentinel (i.e. special character such as NUL) in untrusted inputs.


**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Use a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.




### Observed Examples
