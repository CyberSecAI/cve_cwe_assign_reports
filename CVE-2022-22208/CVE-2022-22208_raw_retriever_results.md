# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2022-22208

## Query
A Use After Free vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rdp) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS). When a BGP session flap happens, a Use After Free of a memory location that was assigned to another object can occur, which will lead to an rpd crash. This is a race condition that is outside of the attackers control and cannot be deterministically exploited. Continued flapping of BGP sessions can create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S11 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8 19.2 version 19.2R1 and later versions 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S6 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S1, 21.2R3. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S4-EVO 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R3-S2-EVO 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO.
