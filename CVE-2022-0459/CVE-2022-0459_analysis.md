## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Use after free** in Screen Capture". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also confirms the **root cause** of vulnerability is "**Use-after-free**". The description of CWE-416 "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed" matches the vulnerability's description. The Mapping Guidance indicates that the Usage is ALLOWED for CWE-416 and that the Rationale for it being at the Variant level of abstraction is a preferred level for mapping. Because of **heap corruption**, CWE-122 might also be present, however the primary cause is the Use-After-Free.
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant and child of several other CWEs like CWE-672 and CWE-825. It can also precede CWE-123(Write-what-where Condition).

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit evidence from the vulnerability description)
