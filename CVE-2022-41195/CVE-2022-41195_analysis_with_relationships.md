# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2022-41195 with Relationship Information

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.75 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a "stack-based overflow," making **CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow)** the most relevant primary CWE. This aligns with the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. The description also alludes to "**lack of proper memory management**" which can mean that resources are not being properly managed and no limits are being put on resource allocation. This is what makes **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)** a valid secondary candidate. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary is empty, which reduces confidence, but the vulnerability description is reasonably clear.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a more general class. CWE-770 is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), but focuses specifically on the allocation aspect.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 0.75 (Moderate evidence from vulnerability description)
