|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 99.0.4844.74 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page." This directly maps to CWE-416, Use After Free, which occurs when the product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating the root cause is "Use-after-free in ANGLE". The attack vector involves a crafted HTML page, indicating a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability. The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-416 as the top candidate with a high score. Given the direct statement of "use after free" and the variant level of abstraction, CWE-416 is the most appropriate choice.

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiry). Exploiting a use-after-free can lead to various impacts, potentially including remote code execution, as indicated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details)
