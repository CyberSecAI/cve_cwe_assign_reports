## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states "**use after free** in ANGLE in Google Chrome". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this, stating, "The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** error present in the ANGLE component of the Chromium browser," and "The ANGLE component frees a memory location, but the program continues to use it." This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-416, which is "The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed." CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The MITRE mapping guidance states that the usage is "Allowed" and the rationale is "This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities." The provided **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** also confirm this with "**rootcause: use after free**".

  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiry). Exploitation can lead to various impacts, including arbitrary code execution.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Explicit mention of "use-after-free" in the vulnerability description and CVE summary)

# Relevant CWE Specifications

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free
Use-After-Free

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Potential Mitigations
**Mitigation 1:**
- **Phase:** Architecture and Design
- **Strategy:** Language Selection
- **Description:** Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.

**Mitigation 2:**
- **Phase:** Implementation
- **Effectiveness:** Defense in Depth
- **Strategy:** Attack Surface Reduction
- **Description:** When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed. However, the utilization of multiple or complex data structures may lower the usefulness of this strategy.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).

## CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description

Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-3547:** Chain: race condition (CWE-362) might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference (CWE-476)
