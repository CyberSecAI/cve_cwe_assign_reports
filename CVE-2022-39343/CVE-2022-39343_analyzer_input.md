# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2022-39343

## Vulnerability Description
Azure RTOS FileX is a FAT-compatible file system thats fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes **integer under and overflows** which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer under and overflows**
- **impact:** buffer overflow and memory corruption
- **product:** Azure RTOS FileX
- **version:** before 6.2.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code does not properly validate the size of the log entry against the remaining log file size, leading to a potential buffer overflow when copying data from the log entry to a destination sector in the file system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper bounds check",
    "Potential buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A maliciously crafted log entry can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted log entry within a fault-tolerant file system's log file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify the log file of the fault-tolerant file system to include a log entry with a length that exceeds the remaining log space. The attacker must have knowledge of the format of the fault-tolerant log and the file system being targeted."
