# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

- **Analysis and Justification:**  
  - *Explanation:* The vulnerability description explicitly states a **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in iDRAC9 and iDRAC8 versions prior to certain versions. The **root cause** is a **stack-based buffer overflow** which an attacker could exploit with high privileges, potentially leading to control process execution and access to the iDRAC operating system. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE that directly addresses this type of vulnerability and is therefore the most specific and appropriate mapping. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause as "**Stack-based buffer overflow**".
  
  - *Relationship Analysis:* CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a more general class of memory corruption vulnerabilities. In this case, since the stack is explicitly mentioned, CWE-121 is the better choice.

- **Confidence Score:**  
  - Confidence: 1.0 (Direct evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference)
